University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mitch Abolafia	4.3	2	Sociology	610	3	4	4	4	462994	4/8/10	Good professor. Wished he had more experience managing in the real world because it is different from the theory he presented in class.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mitch Abolafia	4.3	1	Sociology		3	3	3	5	462994	2/9/06	He's just okay.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mitch Abolafia	4.3	2	Sociology		1	5	4	5	462994	9/22/04	He's a hottie in his birks! But, the glare from his dome can be blinding...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		1	5	5	5	110112	1/27/13	Great professor who has a vast amount of knowledge. All the crj professors look up to him because of everything he has done. You aren't a real crj major unless you've had him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	4	4	5	110112	12/13/12	Excellent Professor! One of the best Criminal Justice Professor in UALbany. You have to read and brief all the cases in the course pack, if you do this and pay attention to the little details, you"ll do fine. GO TO CLASS. It helps if you record the classes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	0	Criminal Justice	202	1	1	1	5	110112	10/13/11	worst teacher i've had at this university. i know a lot about the material but he tested us on small facts and never gave a clear reason as to bad grades. TERRIBLE!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	425	4	5	5	5	110112	10/28/10	He teaches more than one CRJ class and they're all wonderful. He's not exactly an easy teacher but if you're in the major, definitely take some of his classes. Do the readings and ask for help when you need it and you'll do fine. He's the best in the field for a reason. If you're a CRJ major and you don't have him at least once, then you're not CRJ
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	3	5	4	110112	1/26/10	Acker is God he lives and breaths what he teaches. My previous professor was a student of his also. He is the author of the law books what more can I say the class is difficult and requires you to do the work but if you are a CRJ major it should be no problem to obtain a good grade
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	4	4	110112	3/10/09	Amazing Professor! Attendance is not mandatory per se, but its necesary to get by in the class. Tests were difficult, but if you study and know your stuff, not bad at all. Tests were not multiple choice, all short answer and/or essay. End of the year paper was not hard at all. Highly recomend taking this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	4/10/08	Great teacher. If you go to class you'll really understand the material. You really need to do the readings, but they're not boring. It's not a lot of work, and if you put enough effort in you'll get a good grade. He's an awsome teacher and i'll definatly take him again.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	1	3	5	3	110112	12/19/07	Acker is hilarious, I love the way he talks and all of his silly bodily movements while lecturing. The cases we studied were really interesting and I think I know a lot more about law now. Still, this class was HARD. H-A-R-D! The grading was strict with no curve. On top of that, my TA barely spoke English and was of no help at all. Ridiculous!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	5	5	4	110112	12/20/06	Acker is a great professor. Makes class interesting, and really seems to care about his students doing well in his class. Tests are pretty hard. WARNING: HIS TAs ARE PRETTY BAD. They grade everything and can really screw you over. Try to take an Acker class without TAs, because I think it would be a great class. Even so, 202 really isn't bad
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	9/5/06	Acker is a great Professor. He is very smart and accomplished, with both his PHD and JD. He really cares about students, but if you are looking for an easy A his class probly isn't it. His classes are great/fun/interesting but challenging and a lot of work. Take him!! Especially if you are looking for a potential reccomendation
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	4	5	5	4	110112	12/19/12	My favorite professor for my first semester at the university. Extremely knowledgeable on the material, and introduces the material in a very engaging manner. If you have a question, he will thoroughly and very politely reiterate the issue until you are clear. Absolutely a wonderful professor, and extremely comical to just top it off!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	1	4	4	5	110112	10/19/12	BEST teacher SUNY Albany has to offer in terms of CRJ. GO TO CLASS, if you don't you will struggle because the tests are not easy. if you get lost in the material ask for help and it is there.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	4	4	3	110112	4/5/11	Acker is almost to knowledgable to teach. He is a retired defense attorney and is extremely intelligent. His tests are extremely hard. You need to study and attendance is not mandatory but there will be specifics on part of the tests that you can only get from going to the class and paying attention. Don't take for an easy A. I learned a lot.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	2	5	5	110112	2/10/10	Great course. Dr. Acker is very smart and if you do your work and prepare for the exams you should do good. Know your case briefs and enjoy the world of criminal law and hypotheticals.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	4	3	110112	3/18/09	Dr. Acker is an amazing professor. He usually makes lectures interesting and if you do the work, the class will be relatively easy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	3	4	4	110112	1/26/09	Great class, but difficult - buy your course packet and read the cases!! make sure you write the briefs they help so much at test time.... the three exams are all extremely fact specific so make sure you know everything..... attend lecture and take notes.......great professor
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	4	3	3	110112	12/21/07	Amazing class/teacher. I wasn't too interested in law until I took this class. Acker knows his stuff and is very involved in the school. TA was ok... 3 tests (not multiple choice) and one research paper that you could pick your CRJ topic. I definitely recommend taking this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	4	3	4	110112	12/18/07	Acker is a genius in the field of CJ. If you pay attention to what he says, you'll learn a lot about CJ. But the class itself is hard. Lots of cases to read/brief, 3 essay exams and 1 7-10 page paper. To succeed, you must know the criminal cases and take good notes. Acker is brilliant but he lacks in clarity and grades strict. Good luck.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	11/9/06	Acker is an amazing professor, but this is a tough course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	4	3	110112	8/6/06	Great teacher! Tough course.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	1	4	3	5	110112	1/6/06	great class, he is a great teacher who is very enthusiastic and every lecture has some interesting fact or story to take away from it. Be careful though because the class is fairly difficult.

He makes the hardest concepts seem so easy, and the man is just brilliant. Any CRJ majors or minors should definitely take one of his classes...if you work hard, you won't regret it!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	5	5	4	110112	1/18/05	Easily the best professor in UAlbany. Course is tough, but well worth it. Only class i actually enjoyed going to.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	4	5	5	5	110112	11/4/04	he is so amazing

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	1	Criminal Justice	202	1	3	3		110112	8/30/04	Interesting class but VERY hard tests
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	5/1/06	Acker is god!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	1	Criminal Justice	202	3	3	3	4	110112	12/23/05	Acker is a very good professor Although sometimes confusing. The worst part of this class are the Tas, I don't know about the other ones, but I took Adams and he's very bad, never understood what he was talking about,his writing is very unclear, often writes in abreviation and explains things very fast, I do not recomend him
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	496	1	4	3	1	110112	10/10/05	amazing person, highly knowledgable..difficult!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	5	5	5	110112	9/8/05	Definately one of the best professors at Ualbany. You actually want to attend his lectures, he tells you fascinating things and encourages debate. The discussion groups sucked though. But you won't be disappointed you took this class.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	12/12/04	possibly the most intelligent and lucid professor at Albany. Very knowledgeable and approachable.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	5	5	5	110112	11/3/04	Explains things clearly

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Lissette Acosta	4.5	2	Latin American Studies	269	4	5	5	4	1580189	6/25/12	I took her summer online session for this and it was great! I work a 40-hr work week and still had time for this. About 3 Chapters of reading and there would be a 25 question test each week; fair grader and is understanding. Always available for help or clarity. Great choice for a summer class!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Lissette Acosta	4.5	2	Latin American Studies	269	5	5	5	5	1580189	6/10/11	Very interesting class, and she is an awesome teacher. should be an easy A.the midterm,final, and 12 quizzes are on blackboard.drops lowest 2 quizzes. she is fun and will say some things in spanish though not every student knows spanish, and will call out students. There is some reading but you can get buy without it. she is gorgeous also
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Lissette Acosta	4.5	2	Latin American Studies	200	5	4	4	5	1580189	11/7/11	easy class but it could be boring some days, she speaks in spanish often so if you don;t know it you will have to ask her to clarify. if you take caribb history she will focus more on the spanish islands of the carribean with haiti and jamaica as the exception, you may also leave her class never wanting to visit the island...to each their own
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Lissette Acosta	4.5	2	Latin American Studies	269	4	5	3	5	1580189	5/14/11	Extremely easy gen ed...u have to go to class and take notes but your allowed to have 2 absences. 2 quizzes per week on blackboard from notes in class and both midterm and final are on blackboard. somewhat interesting...easy A

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ellen Adams	5.0	2	Education	500	3	5	5	4	654279	8/18/05	Ellen also teaches at Russell Sage in Albany and typically only teaches the summer session at UAlbany.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	1	Education	777	1	3	3	3	1065170	4/7/12	The course is centered around A LOT of reading and discussions. There is a midterm & final paper (you have a few options for each). Don't wait until the end of the semester to begin your final paper. Go to her office hours and get feedback, since her background is English she has high expectations for writing and grades tough.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	0	Education	652	5	1	1	1	1065170	11/7/11	The biggest waste of my time...sincerely a sweet lady but offered nothing to my education.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	1	Education	456	5	2	3	3	1065170	3/2/09	Does not prepare you for real teaching. Class became more of a place to "vent" than to learn.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	2	Education	778	3	5	5	3	1065170	7/5/08	Her qualitative research methods seminars are well thought out and useful. She is supportive and her assignments helped me to progress in my own research beyond what I expected.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	0	Education	652	2	1	1	1	1065170	11/7/11	Agee does not prepare students for the educational world. Many classes are spent on useless discussions.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	2	Education	600	3	5	5	5	1065170	7/6/09	Another commenter mentioned that class became a place to vent... I don't think I ever experienced that in Dr. Agee's classes. She gives students the space to ask questions and find their own answers. Intelligent resourceful and really nice.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	2	Education	777	1	5	5	3	1065170	12/23/08	Dr.Agee's classes are always demanding but intellectually very enriching. If you want to get a solid grounding in qualitative research methods, you MUST take her 777 and 778 courses. You will do a lot of work, but you will learn a lot.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jane Agee	3.3	2	Education	652	5	4	4	5	1065170	12/1/07	Talks a bit too slowly, and too much, but she's a nice woman whose classes are incredibly easy to do well in. She only cares that you're trying your best.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mohammad Alam	2.2	1	Physics	240	4	3	2	2	9047	12/6/12	He is a great guy and very into the modern physics. Most classes were spent talking about theoretical physics such as time travel and alternate dimensions. Overall the class was easy, questions for HW and Tests come directly from the book and the tests are take home. He does bring religion into physics a lot because he does believe in a creator.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mohammad Alam	2.2	2	Physics	353	5	5	2	2	9047	12/17/10	He is not a clear teacher,he does not use a textbook,and he talks 70% the time about his family,ailments,and "pawticle physics." Despite all his shortcoming though, you will NOT find a more helpful teacher in UAlbany! Exams are easy,he is a VERY easy guy to talk to,and he's very smart! And did I mention he's helpful? God Bless Saj!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mohammad Alam	2.2	0	Physics	250	5	1	3	5	9047	5/21/08	In professor Alam's class, I learned about his new found fascination with biology, his health ailments, his financial status, djinns, and how particle physics has convinced him of the existence of God. Hmmm...I'm not seeing much physics in there. Nice guy who wants his students to do well but a terrible professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mohammad Alam	2.2	0	Physics	104	2	1	1	3	9047	1/27/07	worst prof i ever had....never gave a syllabus.....never stuck to his word.....changed class time and room twice....missed 5 or more classes and was an egotistical tool.....would never reccomend for anyone unless they are willing to be frusterated and bored and masochistic

The reason he doesn't clarify well in class is because hes so smart. Take up his research project and you will see. He will help if you need it. Just because a student can't read a text book doesn't mean this guy should get a bad rating. 3 Take home tests...

Her class wasn't hard at all, and she did talk about herself a lot but she was just trying to get us interested.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	0	Sociology	250	5	1	3	2	488042	9/4/05	Very easy class as long as you go and copy the stupid notes off of powerpoint. You don't need the book at all so it's a waste of over $100. Tests are a joke... as is her paper... it's just you actually have to show up. Bring stuff to do in between writing

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	0	Sociology		5	1	1	2	488042	11/29/04	Today she screamed at the top of her lungs at someone for talking during a movie. She's a few fries short of a happy meal. I'd say don't take her class, but chances are she won't be teaching here again.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	1	Sociology		5	3	2	3	488042	11/7/04	She's not a professor, she's a grad student and she should NOT be teaching. I wasted my money taking this class. She knows how to outline journal articles but that's about it. By far,the worst class ever.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	2	Sociology	250	5	4	5	1	488042	6/18/05	Honestly, I think although this teacher was rated really badly, I really don't think it's that hard of a course. She offers extra credits, online, and reading reports that you do, and it doesn't take much effort to do them and up your grade by at least a letter grade. Her tests were decent, not extremely easy but fair.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	0	Sociology		5	2	2	3	488042	11/18/04	If you are interested in learning anything BESIDES what she, her boyfriend, grandmother or mother do, don't take her class. Her only examples of class material are her personal life. Worst teacher ever.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Nicole Albright	2.5	1	Sociology		4	3	2	4	488042	11/5/04	Most unorganized prof ive ever had. Makes rude comments to students in her class. Talks about herself constantly. Never has things graded and back to you in time. Doesnt post notes online, so must attend class. Only good thing, ex credit.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science	287	2	5	2	1	509007	12/11/08	I took him for African history. I really could not understand his lectures one bit. He jumps all over the place in his lectures and does not have a real set agenda. Hard to follow and understand, but a very nice teacher nonetheless. Take home midterm was nice! Never even read one of the three textbooks and wouldn't do any better if I had them eithe
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science	206	3	5	5	5	509007	4/6/06	Very thorough, patient, and a very good teacher. Has time for students. A professional and a gentleman.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science		5	4	4	1	509007	5/2/05	nice guy
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science	287	2	5	5	2	509007	7/18/07	A very good teacher. Makes class interesting. Challenges students academically. A very good listener, and is open to students contributions.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science		2	5	5	5	509007	1/6/06	This Professor is very knowledgeable, has good teaching skills and a good listener. He has time for his students and is very helpful. He is one of the finest teachers I have had.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Gyamfi Alexander	4.6	2	Information Science	206	5	5	5	1	509007	11/22/04	This class is very very boring but very very easy. Easiest A ever in college... but very very boring... Easy... but boring.. very boring easy boring easy boring Gyamfi rules!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	0	Spanish	100	2	1	1	4	1212210	1/7/11	She is immature, emotional, unstable, and she has bad teaching methods and skills. Have to work hard on my own to understand. In her personal life she is messed up too. She has just wrecked another TA's relationship. Not a good role model at all!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	0	Spanish	101	1	1	1	3	1212210	3/30/09	SHE CANNOT TEACH, She is not clear on directions, she cannot be trusted. Her word is not good enough, because she will give you the "confused" look and say, "what did i say i did not say?", she has a serious problem teaching, and does not deserve to be teaching, she is not helpful, selective of who she gives attention to, ignores questions in class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	0	Spanish	100	5	1	1	1	1212210	2/6/09	I agree with the previous comment. Abad is very immature. I don't know how the hell she got into grad school.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	2	Spanish	101	3	5	4	2	1212210	4/3/09	Professor Abad is extremely helpful (when you treat her with RESPECT). Storming out of class & giving attitude is what's immature. Any professor would agree. The Arabic comment-OUT OF LINE. Grow up COLLEGE STUDENTS. All she asks for is to show effort and you'll pass her class. Pretending you didn't know of HW posted is failing yourself.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	0	Spanish	101	1	1	2	1	1212210	2/10/09	very hard class, expects you to remember spanish from high school as well as your ABC's, some dances and only addresses you in spanish when she wants to be heard and then makes you feel bad for not understanding her, its a 100 level class, she teaches it as if we have know spanish like it is englih!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arinka Abad	1.8	0	Spanish	100	2	1	2	1	1212210	1/15/09	worst teacher ever. she was very immature and useless. she taught as if we were in aspn 500. she did not teach well at all. i would not want her to teach me ever again. waste of my time.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	0	Psychology	211	1	1	2	3	858510	4/10/08	This was one of the worst experiences I've had since being in this school. Terrible, only wants to rush through the material, has very hard exams and not helpful. He just wants his doctorate. My advice, don't do it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	0	Psychology		2	2	2	2	858510	6/13/07	well i didnt go to class but the times i did hes teaches straight from the book...so all i did was read the book and teach it to myself and did better than 80% of the class...as for extra help i asked him once and all he said was did u look it up in the book .
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	2	Psychology	210	4	4	3	2	858510	3/14/07	Sometimes things are a bit confusing but if you ask him again, he'll try to explain it. The homeworks are easy, as long as you pay attention in class and read the book. There are examples for everything and you just have to follow them. Also, he was very available to meet with students for any extra help, which helped a lot if you were confused.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	0	Psychology	210	2	3	1	2	858510	1/2/07	it's a horrible class to begin with. dean's a nice guy and is available for extra help quite often, curves grades, gives extra credit, etc. however he is CONFUSING and has no idea how to explain things so that you can understand them. i often doubt that he really knows what hes talking about.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	2	Psychology	380	4	5	4	4	858510	6/14/06	I am taking him now for a summer course. He is a very sweet guy, he isnt afraid to curve tests and admits when he makes a bad question. He is very fair and professional. He also offers extra credit through participation. I must also say that he is absolutely gorgeous, and just looking at him in class makes me accidentally smirk.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	0	Psychology	210	2	1	2	1	858510	4/8/08	He's really unapproachable-claims to be available during office hours, but then seems to resent your presence when you show up to them.He's not very clear, and is condescending when you ask for clarification.I think he's one of those Cognitive-Behavioral Psychologist Robots who likes numbers and other manipulatable varibles more than people.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	2	Psychology	210	3	5	4	2	858510	5/4/07	If you don't go to class, you won't pass it. He is a very straight forward teacher who I appreciate greatly. I see him everyday before an assignment is due and he is very helpful and has no problem telling me if I'm right or wrong before I hand in the assignment. Do the homework and study (as a student should do) and you'll be fine.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Dean Acheson	2.6	1	Psychology	203	2	3	2	2	858510	2/28/07	ok dont take it with him. there are so many other professors and easyer ones aleast. he does not explain things well, and will skip steps during a stat problem which just makes everything more confusing. Although he is cute and very nice to look at, his homeworks are impossible to do well on and hes tests are very hard.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Charles Ackerbauer	3.3	0	Journalism	270	5	1	1	3	898566	10/30/08	He rambles with no purpose; takes 15 minutes to finish a sentence. He doesn't teach the class useful and practical information. He is always late or doesn't show at all. Ackerbaur's class is a waste of time and a waste of money. It does seem like an easy A, if you're willing to put up with extreme boredom.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Charles Ackerbauer	3.3	2	Journalism	300	5	5	4	4	898566	10/10/06	Has a lot of experience working with print media, was an editor of a small paper and worked for a local paper before teaching here. Class is interesting, if you're interested in Journalism this is a good place to start.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Charles Ackerbauer	3.3	2	Journalism	200	4	5	4	4	898566	9/20/07	First few days seemed unorganized, got better as we went. Good professor with a lot of experience in a a range of areas. Could give much more first hand experience than any full-time professor could. I recommend this prof

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	0	Mathematics	112	1	1	1	4	920180	4/7/13	Terrible professor. Skips steps and is condescending and rushed when you ask him for help. The class began with over 50 and is now around 10 students. Don't expect a prompt response for emails either. I don't know who the comments from before are about but other students agree; find another professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	3	5	5	2	920180	11/14/12	Great stats teacher, very friendly and will answer all your questions with a good example. Gives good examples for problems. Tests are easy if you study and pay attention in class, a lot of the time he gives you the equations that you need for the tests
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	5	5	5	5	920180	5/3/11	best teacher ever! hw is toooo simple
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	5	5	5	4	920180	5/18/10	Do not buy textbook for this class! He even tells you this, you will never use it. He is a great teacher, I got an A- when I figured out my grade, but he must have curved it because I got an A. Three of my four tests were 88,82,78 and I still got an A. Great, great teacher! Highly Recommend for Stats!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	4	4	4	3	920180	5/15/09	william is the best statsteacher at albany. his test are a bit of a challenge but he has a great curve and no attendance is required. recommended stats teacher
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	1	Mathematics	112	3	4	2	3	920180	11/18/08	He is very knowledgeable in his field, however I feel he doesn't portray the information in the most understandable way. He is sometimes confusing and can't even answer some questions. On the bright side, there is usually a huge curve. His class is fairly boring unless you enjoy calculus. He usually makes attempts at jokes but they always fall flat

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	112	3	5	5	5	920180	11/16/06	Professor Adamczak is defintely knowledgable in his field
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	106	4	5	4	4	920180	12/13/12	Took him for stats, really nice guy. Tests aren't too hard, and he gives notes in class. homework is online.. not too hard either. Goes a little fast but he's eager to explain what you don't understand. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you don't go, you won't understand.. gives you formulas you need for the exams too. Final is NOT cumulative.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	5	5	5	5	920180	4/17/12	best stats teacher in the world! youll regret not having him if you have to take stats. by far the easiest professor ever. he makes math problems fun and interesting and his homeworks, quizes and tests are so easy. im horrible at math and i got above an 80 on all without studying. TAKE HIM
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	106	4	5	5	4	920180	4/26/11	AMAZING teacher! On tests, as long as you get the jist of the problem, (answers don't have to be spot on), you get a majority of the points. Homework is online and you can answer as many times as you want for an easy 100! Attendence not manditory but it makes things so much easier. Just go to class and take good notes and you'll have an easy A!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	108	4	5	4	2	920180	4/16/10	Excellent, Excellent teacher. No required attendance, no book use. Most of the grades is based on homework, which is online and you can attempt the questions as often as you want. Tests are easy, and he reviews before them. He's helpful and answers any questions you could have. I hate math and did really well and appreciated the class.STATS CLASS
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	920180	12/9/08	he was really fun and was a great teacher. he is sometimes unclear, but eventually clears things up. he is a nice guy! take him!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	William Adamczak	4.2	2	Mathematics	112	5	5	4	5	920180	10/30/08	He is awesome!! Whoever has him next year will have a lot of fun and understand calculus! :D

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephanie Affinito	4.8	2	Education	600	4	5	5	5	703913	10/19/10	Very helpful! She's willing to explain and work with you if you have problems. The nicest professor I've had at SUNY Albany. Take any class you can with her, you won't regret it!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephanie Affinito	4.8	2	Education	500	5	4	4	3	703913	9/27/06	There was a lot of reading, but you really did not need to do it. She is very understanding of problems that arise and is approachable and nice. Sometimes the lectures were boring but the class material could be the blame. There were a lot of projects (but that's what the class entails) but she definitely is an easy A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephanie Affinito	4.8	2	Education	600	4	5	5	3	703913	8/19/08	Very nice teacher. Assignments were time consuming, and there were many, and sometimes the grade was only P/F. She makes you do things over if you missed something. Got an A=)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephanie Affinito	4.8	2	Education	615	5	5	5	5	703913	12/16/05	Quite a bit of reading and writing in this class, but I don't know if anyone walked out without an A. Hands-on, real-life ideas that people can actually use in the classroom. She actually taught for about 4 years or so, and knows what can work. Very sweet, relaxed and wants to help you learn & succeed.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	1	Physics	105	4	2	4	3	794098	1/15/13	Ahmad is a good lecturer, and throws in jokes and questions to the class enough to keep it interesting. When I took the class, Professor Schmidt wrote all the exams and homework so there was a bit of a disadvantage there.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	4	3	2	794098	10/17/11	Just finished the first exam. Just to clear things up, the exam questions are like 9827342643852 easier than the practice problems in the textbook. Oh, and hes a cool prof
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	3	4	4	794098	1/31/11	Ahmad's class is a pretty easy class if you can understand physics. Even if you can't his class is not too hard. The exams are VERY basic compared to the homeworks and his midterm exams are curved. Also, you only need an 80-85 for an A/A-. 70-75 for B+/B. Just do the homeworks and try to read the book.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	106	3	2	2	4	794098	11/4/09	The professor is very knowledgeable about the subject but he is not to great at teaching it. It takes him way longer than it should to explain one topic. His exams are a lot harder than the homework questions or anything gone over during class. Overall I would say his class is very frustrating. He makes many mistakes
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	4	4	4	794098	5/17/09	Good teacher. If you pay attention, you can understand explanations. Sometimes has funny jokes. Knows his physics and mathematics well. Do practice problems in book, or you will fail the tests. will try to give points on tests where he can. Physics is hard so people do bad, but if you understand the basic concepts you will be ok.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	1	Physics	105	1	3	3	2	794098	10/23/08	Ahmad is a good guy.. the class was difficult but just because physics does not interest me at all. You do really need to do the practice problems for the tests. Compared to other general physics prof I have heard about he is one of the better ones. He wants the class to do well and at times he is quite funny, in a cute old man way =)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	108	2	4	4	1	794098	8/4/08	I had a very bad experience in PHY105 with another prof., so I was not looking forward to this class. Fortunately, Prof. Ahmad not only knows physics, he knows how to teach! I won't lie and say he gives easy As, but you won't be left in the cold if you need help understanding the material. If you have to take physics, take it with him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	108	4	4	5	4	794098	1/9/08	Great professor...key to doing well in his class is to take really good notes and listen! You might not even have to read the textbook if you take good notes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	106	1	1	2	3	794098	5/25/07	This was by far the worst teacher i have ever had.The first day of class he said that he doesnt have office hours he said i see you 3x a week in class isnt that enough.When a student emailed him a question he said from now on foward your questions to the TAs only,which were unavailiable. details on simple problems/ideas not on the complex material
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	108	3	4	4	4	794098	3/7/07	He is a good teacher. He will go over any homework you have trouble with and takes almost 1/3 of the class to clarify problems. Take clear notes, do the homework problems until you get them down and pay attention cuz a problem on the tests might pop up that he went over in class. grades on a nice curve.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	5	4	2	794098	10/22/12	Underrated professor in my opinion. Funny guy, extremely helpful during office hours and tells you everything you need to know during class. Some people think his accent is somewhat hard to understand but it really isn't bad. Plus there is a huge curve on the grades
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	5	4	2	794098	5/18/11	Ahmad is a great teacher! Ahmad teaches you everything you need to know in class, it's the student's responsibility to comprehend it! Literally nobody from lecture showed up until the final exam. Physics is not hard if you show up AND do the reading/homework! The final and midterm are only 5 chaps each even if you study like 13 or 14 chapters!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	1	Physics	105	2	2	4	1	794098	11/9/09	Not a bad guy, he is really nice and enjoyable at times, but his exams are impossible. I could do every practice trouble in the book and still did horrible on his exams. The class average for one exam was a 6.5/20.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	1	3	4	2	794098	8/27/09	Adding comments for those taking classes in the Fall. Physics is very very hard. I hated it in high school and I hate it in college. But he is not a bad professor. Go over practice examples over and over and work with the TAs. Hey I got a B!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	105	1	1	2	2	794098	1/22/09	If it were not Prof. Ahmad's job to teach, I guess he'd be an okay guy. Honestly though, all he did was go over problems from the book- which is great. But he didn't explain the concepts (at all, it seemed). Worst class ever.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	102	2	1	1	1	794098	9/5/08	He is awful! Dont take him or you will be kicking yourself for it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	105	1	1	2	1	794098	1/19/08	He's nice little guy but he's not very patient when it comes time to explain the material he just went over.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	3	4	5	4	794098	10/26/07	Hes a good guy dont listen to the people that say hes a bad teacher. He will go over anything you dont know as long as u ask questions he doesnt care how long it takes just as long as u understand it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	108	4	5	5	5	794098	5/22/07	Great teacher.Take him .Very helpful , funny and I think his class was the most interesting that I ever took at Albany.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	5	3	5	794098	12/28/06	Says you need around an 85 for an A, however this is a lie. If you get 15/20 or higher on every test you will get an A regardless of what he says. Pretty sure I bombed the final and still got an A. He is a nice guy, helps you when you ask, small accent but it is not too bads. Do the problems and you will do well on the tests. Take him for physics.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	5	5	5	794098	11/2/06	Whoever said he was the worst teacher is an idiot. Granted, his exams can be a little tricky, but you don't have to be ignorant and call a teacher stupid for your own stupidity. Go over the problems he assigns, repeatedly, and you should be fine. A really nice and funny old man.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	106	2	1	1	2	794098	7/7/06	Are you kidding me, he was the worst! So unclear, so not helpful. He had a heart attack just before our final and we had a some cruddy intern/TA and the head of the physics dept teachingt uson a rotating basis for a couple days.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	105	4	5	5	4	794098	1/6/06	Outstanding professor. Very helpful inside and outside of the classroom. Constantly relates the material to real life. For an intro physics class, it isn't going to get any better than this. Most of the exams are pretty challenging, but he curves the grades a lot. I definately recommend this professor. Sit in the front&come to class, he'll remember
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	2	Physics	109	5	5	5	1	794098	9/10/06	He made the material very simple. His tests were just like the problems he did in class and he curved a lot because of most of the class didn't do very well. He even gives you a formula sheet for the exams so you don't have to memorize equations. Very easy teacher and an easy course if you go to class and do the problems he suggests.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Shamshad Ahmad	3.3	0	Physics	109	3	1	1	1	794098	2/8/06	ARE YOU SERIOUS!? He is the most useless horrible teacher in the entire school. He does not care about the students and is very unclear. You would think that after 30 years of teaching he could speak english, but no! Avoid him at all costs
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Donna Aitoro	5.0	2	Communication		4	5	5	3	842619	5/4/06	A class where you can speak, and it makes you think.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	4	2	1	3	1081006	12/30/12	This class is not hard. But she makes it hard with her terrible lesson formats and throwing information at you that doesnt pertain to the scope of the course. Top it off with the accent a large lecture hall and the inevitable hang over and the classes are nearly unbearable. If you have a pulse you'll at least get a B. If you dont, reevaluate urself
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	2	2	2	1	1081006	11/8/12	This class is terrible..her accent is thick but my biggest complaint is how heavily each question on exams are weighted. She makes it so every question on exams are worth ONE point of your final grade. I'm not sure about the curve yet, but I hear it's small. Beware!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	3	3	1	4	1081006	5/26/12	Very difficult to understand. Basically taught myself the entire class. Her method of teaching is just doing problems on the projector, she does not explain why you need to do things. You wont understand what you are doing, you will just memorize the steps. When less then 1/4 of the class shows up and the other 3/4 skip the class, it says something
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	3	4	4	1	1081006	12/23/11	As long as you go to class and do the homework, you will get an A. She was very understanding, and really nice :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	5	3	3	5	1081006	12/31/10	Interesting class. Easy A. Grades consist of 8-10 online homework assignments, where you can get 10 total problems wrong and still receive full credit, and 3 tests. The tests get more difficult as the semester progresses, but are still not too bad. The class as a whole is curved at the end, but the curve is small as people seem to do well.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	3	2	3	1081006	6/16/10	hard to understand, but the tests are easy. just go to class (if u want), study the hw and the practice problems, and you'll be good. for some reason, my txt book was missing 2 chapters..which made it harder. only thing i didnt like was that i was in the hospital b4 the test and she didnt excuse me for the exam.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	4	4	4	3	1081006	5/18/10	She is a very nice professor, explains things well. Goes through questions in detail, she is very responsive to students also. If you go to every class and don't get an A or A- you have a problem. The test are easy, the homeworks are easy. Just put some effort in this class and you will do good.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business		5	1	2	4	1081006	5/17/10	Went to maybe 8 classes all semester. Got a B. Too simple to even concern yourself with.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	2	3	2	2	1081006	12/4/09	It's very hard to understand her and attendance is not required. The problems she goes over in class help with the homework assignments, which can increase your grade. The instructor doesn't help, but as long as you do the practice problems, you'll have a guideline to what is covered on the exams.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business		5	1	1	1	1081006	5/28/09	worst class i ever took....warning to seniors DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS...doesnt speak english and her teaching style is retarded
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	2	4	5	1	1081006	12/19/12	This is a hard class. To get an A you need to constantly study the material and do the assignments and quiz online. She uses class time wisely, which is why she goes so fast. Practicing the problems is the best way to get an A in this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	3	3	3	1081006	10/16/12	The class has 400 students so it makes it hard to learn from her. she reads slides and doing problems on the projector sometimes i didnt understand her because she has an accent she left the last 15 minutes of class to do a test review which wasnt enough time i really disliked this class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	1	1	1	4	1081006	12/25/11	Class is very confusing when you learn from the teacher. Time is better spent doing the homework and learning from the book and TA instead of wasting your time with the teacher. She is ok, but is ridiculously anal about people texting in class and will stop class frequently to address it. You are better off taking another teacher.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	3	2	1	2	1081006	5/14/11	make sure u sit in the front because u wont be able to understand her otherwise. If u go to class ull have no problem doing the homework....tests are somewhat difficult bc the review sheets she gives u are harder than the test so u have no idea how to do the problems on there and then get stressed out thinking ur gunna bomb the test...yeah.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	5	2	5	1081006	6/24/10	Good professor, but hard to understand her, she is very helpful, nice to everyone. The important is east to get an A+ !!!! Don't miss her!!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	5	4	2	1	1081006	6/13/10	got an A and barely did my homework. i pulled all nighters before the tests and did well every time.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	4	3	3	1081006	5/18/10	I thought this class was very interesting. She does lots of examples in class to help out with understanding. She does have an accent but I found that by the middle of the semester you should get used to that. I went to almost every class and I found it boring very little of the time so I would recommend this class to others as you will learn.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	3	3	4	1081006	4/16/10	She is difficult to understand. But she tries her best to help students. Even though the course is difficult, her exams are not that hard if you understand the concepts. The material can be dry and boring sometimes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	4	2	2	3	1081006	8/8/09	She was hard to understand, class was boring and lectures weren't all that useful. 3 multiple choice tests were given, all questions could be answered if you learned how to do the basic problems in the book; all of which were very easy. Said she would give homework to the next semester. Also had a large curve; only took an 83 to get an A-.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	1	1	1	3	1081006	5/1/09	Could not understand a word she said and she was one of the most boring teachers I've taken in 3 years at the University. I would have probably dropped my business minor if I had her at the beginning of it because she was the worst professor I could imagine taking.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	2	1	1	3	1081006	4/27/09	Worst teacher I have EVER had at UAlbany. Difficult to understand, stumbles over her own examples, makes the class difficult intentionally. The purpose is to teach, not to trick. Just a terrible teacher. Makes it impossible to enjoy the class even if you like the material.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	2	2	2	4	1081006	1/27/09	Probably the worst teacher i have ever had. She is very very hard to understand. She goes very slow on somethings and you want to fall alseep and then speeds though hard material when it is close to test time and expects you to know it for the test. Do NOT take her if you dont like teaching yourself from the text!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	1	2	1	4	1081006	12/10/08	I walked into this class and thought I was in an arabic sermon. I could not understand one word she said. So I ended up having to teach myself everything for the 20 QUESTION tests, that were based on 3-5 chapters. It is insane. No partial credit, multiple choice. This class was my downfall this semester.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	5	4	5	1081006	5/20/08	good professor, tests are easy if u go to class n learn how to use the calculator
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	2	3	3	1081006	5/13/08	The material I found to be interesting but her as a teacher was not my greatest experience. She is very hard to understand sometimes. There were 3 mc tests but all include to do formula work to get your answer.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	2	3	4	1081006	5/12/08	The class is so boring that I couldn't stay awake if I tried. The material is interesting to me but the teacher makes the class gruelling. The tests are not to hard, however I had to teach myself everything. The tests area also not long enough and there is no partial credit so if you get one or two wrong there goes your A. Wouldn't recommend
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	5	5	5	1081006	4/14/08	NICE CLASS
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	4	3	2	3	1081006	4/7/08	3 exams. no homework, no quizzes. her english isnt perfect but relatively easy class. no outside work, no attendance.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	4	3	2	4	1081006	4/23/09	I must say I have to agree with what most of the previous raters have said. She is somewhat difficult to understand due to her accent but overall she is very fair. Print the slides, take notes on examples she gives in class, go over the review sheets and you will do fine on her exams.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	3	2	2	3	1081006	12/14/08	This was a horribe class. She is a horrible teacher. Not only is she difficult to understand due to her accent, but her teaching of of the material is nonsense. Her method of teaching is just doing problems infront of the class. I had to teach myself how to use the calculator and the material. Her final is also cumulative and was poorly organized.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	5	4	5	1081006	5/29/08	made me interested in finance I loved it. She is hard to understand so sit in the front. Go to every class that way you will leanr hwo to use the calculator and learn shortcuts on how to solve the problems. Exams are easy if you go to class with the slides and take good notes. Do review sheets and if you can do those, ull be fine on the exams, EASY
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	2	3	4	1081006	5/16/08	horrible experience, material is interesting but she focuses too much on the math side. she is so hard to understand because of her accent and the class is extremely boring. Also, grading is based entirely off 3 exams so if you do poorly on a subject you might as well kiss your grade goodbye. Do yourself a favor and take the class with someone else
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	3	2	3	4	1081006	5/12/08	The class is so boring that I couldn't stay awake if I tried. The material is interesting to me but the teacher makes the class gruelling. The tests are not to hard, however I had to teach myself everything.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	1	Business	300	1	4	1	4	1081006	4/23/08	She has a heavy accent so she is hard to understand and the material is hard enough to understand but between her and the TAs you can always get an answer.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	2	Business	300	5	5	5	5	1081006	4/14/08	this teacher was awesome. english not to good. no curve. loves to fail people.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sharada Alampalli	2.6	0	Business	300	5	1	1	3	1081006	12/21/07	Easiest class ive ever taken. 4 tests, 20 mult choice/true or false questions, open book, open notes. business school is a joke at albany
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Diana Aldrete	3.8	2	Spanish	206	5	4	5	5	1099413	5/28/08	Pretty easy, willing to help. Pretty accessible outside of class, considerate of health issues. She does take attendance, even if it may seem as if she doesn't. Writing assignments were fairly simplistic. Overall, great class, great professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Diana Aldrete	3.8	1	Spanish	104	4	2	4	5	1099413	1/30/08	As long as you go to class and participate you'll do fine. Tests are relatively easy, she'll give you a study guide the week before so if you study there shouldn't be a problem. And she's very nice and will take time to help you if you don't understand something. If you're not great at Spanish I suggest taking this with her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Tom Alstyne	2.6	0	Anthropology		5	1	1	1	704436	5/24/07	One of the worst professors I have ever come across. It got to the point I would walk in everyday late cuz I couldn't stand the man. Doesn't know how to speak and spent almost the entire semester telling us that you cannot define Folklore..he made an interesting class boring. If I were you I would avoid him..Uhh uh ugh....so dumb
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Tom Alstyne	2.6	2	Anthropology	175	3	4	3	3	704436	11/15/05	This class isn't too bad. The tests are pretty difficult. He takes attendance which is ridiculous because going to the class is pretty much the most pointless thing ever.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Tom Alstyne	2.6	2	Anthropology	175	4	4	4	4	704436	12/23/05	its honestly an easy grade as long as you just do the readings and go to class which can be boring, but you definitley need the notes. definitley easy as long as you do the work for the mostpart
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Tom Alstyne	2.6	0	Anthropology	175	4	3	1	4	704436	9/20/05	It is impossible to pay attention to anything he says because all you can hear is him saying CONSTANTLY "uhhhhh". Instead of taking notes I want to tally how many times he says it in one lecture!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	1	Geography	101	1	2	3	1	147460	12/6/08	Not the greatest professor. Hard!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography	101	1	1	1	1	147460	10/8/05	worst class in all my years of college. hated the man
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography		2	3	1	3	147460	5/23/05	never spent more time laughing in class at suny. Amato is hilarious, he mumbles these sayings and slurs words that cracks everybody up. other than that the class was very boring.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography	101	5	5	5	3	147460	10/17/04	Easy class. Sometimes takes attendance to keep people honest. Willing to answer all questions. Helpful. Tries to make class interesting, but if you're not into it, you're not into it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography		3	3	1		147460	1/2/04	blahhh...*yawn*...huh...whaaaaaa is this test?! he didn't teach this! not really an attention grabber like professors should be...not a good lecturer... i don't recommend this guy...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	1	Geography	101	3	3	3		147460	11/16/03	Bad lecturer, can't keep your attention at all. OK prof.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	1	Geography	420	3	4	2		147460	10/28/03	The class was fairly easy, but Amato is frustrating to listen to because he rambles from one thing to another and constantly contradicts and corrects himself, almost as if he has ADD. he reminds me of the grown version of Butters from South Park...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography	101	3	2	2		147460	7/29/03	No Comments
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography	101	3	5	5		147460	4/8/03	Ohh My Gosh! Dr. Amato was so funny. Did you guys miss the sexiness of the subject and the mental gymnastics?! We love this guy and you can't forget about Kevin and his fingers. CRAZY!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography	101	5	4	5		147460	3/5/03	relayed information clearly and along w/ the material, may be a bit boring, but no attendance policy
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography		2	5	5	3	147460	10/15/05	I worked for this guy and he was great. All I can say about you Freshman is that you didn't have a clue.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography		2	1	3	1	147460	10/7/05	One of the worst classes I took in my 4 yrs there. Don't do it to yourself. The man's a bore, and nasty on top of it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography	101	3	5	5	4	147460	12/16/04	A very nice professor. Interesting/funny. Go to class and study for tests and you'll do fine.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography		2	5	5		147460	2/24/04	Very funny. Good class to take. Will help you if you seek him out, he is extremely nice.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography	101	1	1	1		147460	12/12/03	Worst class in my time at Albany. The guy makes u wanna jump off one of the quad towers. Its a good thing he doesn't take attendance.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	2	Geography	101	4	4	4		147460	11/14/03	Class is fairly easy, do the reading and attend class...it would be no problem...the guy rambles a lot.. and it is boring.. but not bad for killing a gen ed. requirement
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography	101	3	2	1		147460	7/29/03	Either read the book or attend class; both are not required. Class is hellishly boring & puts most to sleep.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography	101	4	1	3		147460	5/24/03	joke class, worthless to even have a teacher
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	0	Geography		4	2	2		147460	4/3/03	Most boring class i have ever taken. Thank god he does not take attendence.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	1	Geography	101	2	3	3		147460	2/25/03	Oh my god, its true, he does like to say Baja California!! He also likes to say Terminal Morraine towards the end of the course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Amato	3.0	1	Geography	101	3	3	3		147460	2/25/03	Likes to say Baja California
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anoumou Amekudji	2.5	1	French	102	2	2	3	5	1378348	8/4/10	He like his subject, but he won't move on unless some one has answered his question. Classes seem to drag on. Most of it is self teaching outside of class. There isn't much homework but really he is a tough grader. Your paper will be covered in red regardless of your grade.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anoumou Amekudji	2.5	1	French	102	3	3	2	1	1378348	12/20/09	It's hard to get an A without dedicating your life to French. You can definately pull a B+ without trying. He was vague about his expectations and his tests weren't too bad, but was kind of a hard grader sometimes.Nice guy tho
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	4	5	5	3	690988	1/26/11	He was absolutely a great teacher. He not only taught me about Rome and Greece. He also taught me how to organize my thoughts correctly and that reality is objective. He changed my life for the better.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	263	3	5	4	3	690988	9/14/10	I took his online class over the summer. He's a great professor and very helpful. He's even willing to talk to you on the phone if you're still confused. The work load wasn't much at all, there are about 6 modules and 2 papers. It sounds a lot, but it isn't. Just put in the effort and you'll do fine. Definitely take his course!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	110	5	5	5	5	690988	3/21/10	Excellent professor. My favorite of the U Albany faculty. He's not a pretentious ideologue like most other professors on campus. Guy actually questions general consensus and looks at things from an economic/sociological perspective. I highly recommend you take his course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	4	5	5	3	690988	11/3/09	Prof. Anadio is the****! He's the coolest guy ever, and he's not a liberal **** like almost every other **** on the SUNY Albany campus. He's a very entertaining prof!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	163	4	5	5	3	690988	5/27/09	Great Professor, 2 papers are your entire grade.. Go to his office hours the week before and he will help you get your ideas organized. If you do this you are an idiot or a really awful writer if you do not get an A in the class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	5	5	5	5	690988	2/3/09	He is the man! Mandatory attendance but only two papers the whole term. He's real chill and just a fun guy. Easy A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	4	5	5	4	690988	11/19/08	i took both his classes ahis 100 and 131 and he is my favorite professor ive had at suny! he's the greatest. he doesnt just lecture to you he makes you involoved and really think. he is very reasonable and if you go to class and do well on the papers it is an easy A! highly recommend his classes :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	3	5	5	5	690988	8/29/08	He's by far my favorite professor at SUNY. He expects you to actually think in class rather than regurgitate facts. He's extremely fair and he is forward and blunt which is a welcome change from typical faculty. Highly recommend his course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	131	2	5	5	4	690988	5/15/08	Professor Anadio, is definitely my FAVORITE professor at UAlbany. He takes attendance, and yes hes strict about it, but its worth it in the end. Only two papers, which are not hard if you take good notes, and he is always available to meet with you. Very knowledgeable, and he makes 845 exciting. I wish he taught more than two classes at Albany.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	131	3	5	5	2	690988	5/5/08	I had Anadio for my first semester at Albany, he is my favorite so far. Here's the deal, there's no homework, there're no tests;However, there are 2 Essays and his attendance policy = very strict;fail after 3 absences. He teaches extremely early, grades fairly, very available for help, is kind of a know it all but is very interesting,nice,and weird
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	263	5	5	4	1	690988	1/4/11	Took this course over the summer time and it was the best!!! He is one of the few teachers that I actually like at SUNY Albany and I actually learned something!!.. Very easy once you put in your work and you read.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	101	2	5	5	1	690988	7/15/10	He was fun, informative and VERY nice to watch. Needed the course for my core curriculum requirements. Wish he taught all of my classes as I learned so much!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	5	5	4	4	690988	12/23/09	awesome professor. pretty much your stereotypical hippie. only 2 papers for his western civ class and they're both easy, it's all in the text book. besides that, he's very interesting and actually makes you want to learn.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	101	3	5	5	3	690988	10/15/09	the only intelligent professor in the US faculty. best teach i've ever had.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	101	5	5	5	4	690988	3/12/09	haha whoever said that this class was really hard isnt that bright. I am an average student. And i wrote the paper with a book this is offered so whoever said there wasnt a boook isnt to bright either. Plus i am not the best at writing and got an b on the first paper. He doesnt grade hard. Youll do fine if you try a little bit!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	101	3	5	5	4	690988	12/9/08	best teacher i've had. makes you think. knows alot. very helpful. funny. 10/10
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	0	History	131	1	1	1	2	690988	10/26/08	o please this professor is horrible. give only 2 papers but grades that like krazy. takes off points for minor things. there is no book so you have to go to class. takes attendance. 3 no shows= fail the class. not an easy a, do not even try it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	4	3	4	1	690988	5/20/08	There are no tests only 2 papers for a midterm and final. Those are the only 2 grades that you will get in the class, so make him think you are interested in his help because he doesnt really read the papers in depth. You have to attend class for attendence, if you dont like going to class dont take this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	3	4	4	1	690988	5/9/08	He is not so bad. He grades fair yet hard. He is somewhat full of himself, and can say things that are out of this world. He hates all Native american Indians,and blames them for everything... or at least it appears this way. Only two papers, but he is a hard grader. More than willing to sepak with you out of class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	3	5	5	4	690988	1/16/08	this guy is so interesting. Only two papers and he grades fairly. I did both of them 3 nights before and got A's on both. He's the best if u go tot class all the time and take rigorous notes, he practically writes the paper for you! He rocks! Take the class IMMIDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	0	History	101	2	1	2	1	690988	12/14/07	Horrible Professor. Talks about his past drug and alcohol abuse. Thinks he is amazing. Tells us hes grading and teaching a 100 level course at a 300 level. Papers are unfairly graded. if you miss 3 classes-you FAIL. no expections. hes rude, stay away from this metal haired, stuck up man!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	0	History	131	1	1	3	1	690988	10/16/07	I do not recommend this teacher to anyone. His teaching methods are not useful at all
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	1	History	130	2	2	4	2	690988	6/16/07	Not the greatest but not the worst. knows what he is talking about. only two papers to write for the class. he loves his hair haha
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	153	4	5	5	4	690988	5/23/07	He was awesome. You have to attend class he is a stickler for attendance. He is really funny and interesting. I took him in an 8 week 2 class and it was cool
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	1	History	100	1	2	3	1	690988	12/29/06	worst professor I have ever had. seems like he wanted the easiest drug filled way out of life so picked teaching history at college. he gave us two essays [which he refuses to write comments on because students apparently don't read those comments] and mandatory attendance. he's a rough grader on the papers too. avoid him at all costs!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	4	4	4	2	690988	5/30/06	The class is very easy with next to no outside work- you just have to go. However his lectures are often very uncomfortable for girls since he thinks that****and his opinions of naked pictures of women are appropriate for lectures. Some guys worship him (and I am scared of those guys) but he is really creepy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History		3	5	5	3	690988	1/26/06	yeah, so, he was actually the man. him and that long hair of his, no guy with long hair can be a dick, it just doesn't work like that. as far as his teaching, yeah, he was pretty good. just make sure you go to class and take reasonably decent notes...unlike what i did :(
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	0	History	130	1	1	1	1	690988	11/20/05	This professor goes through material at a fast pace. His tests require you to write an essay or two and the topics are too general. This course should be an intensive writing course. Questions are unclear. This is a difficult teacher that I would not recommend to anyone.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History		2	4	5	5	690988	11/8/05	First day i saw him i thought he was another student, kind odd crazy looking through. Then he goes to the front-- im your professor crazy long hair and short shorts what? He awesome though, relates to students from the first day, very interesting lectures, my favorite professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History		3	4	4	4	690988	11/1/05	great teacher. his crazy hair and short shorts are always good for a laugh, but once you get past it he's a good guy and a great teacher. very energetic
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	0	History	101	5	1	1	1	690988	10/29/07	Tony, I still remember the day you stopped by to let us know that you would be leaving for a while. I'm glad you're doing well but for christ's sake, it's been years!! We've moved to Mayfield but everyone knows where we are. Anyone else reading this, we always knew Tony would end up a professor or a David Lee Roth look alike in a cover band!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	4	4	4	3	690988	8/18/07	Interesting lectures usually..makes you somewhat want to pay attention at 845 in the morning. Two essays are the only work other than going, so take it if you're not a fan of work.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	3	4	5	1	690988	6/12/07	Best Professor i've had...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	4	5	5	5	690988	5/7/07	Only grades were two essays. I hate essays but he literally gives you all the info you need during the lectures if you pay attention. He delivered his lectures in a manner where I actually liked to listen. His grading was not harsh, its a 100 level class, plus he gave out the essay info a month before it was due
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	100	3	3	5	4	690988	9/18/06	he's a good teacher
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	2	5	4	2	690988	4/8/06	Has high standards for grading, but also helps students a lot by giving them info on the test questions/essays beforehand to let them prepare. Good sense of humor, good presentation of material, including little bits of trivia to make the lectures interesting.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	131	3	5	5	5	690988	12/21/05	He is such an awesome guy and is extremely helpful. He'll take the time and even call students and discuss papers with them. It was only an 8 week class and there was only 2 papers. Great guy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History		2	5	5	5	690988	11/10/05	this guy is the best, the tests are very difficult, but he practiclly tells u wats on it, take any of his classes, youre bound to do well
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	3	5	5	4	690988	11/8/05	Far and away the best professor I've had. Challenging, but not to a fault, Anadio has a great sense of humor. Relates to students very well. His lectures are very interesting and informative, and his attnetion to the art of history is useful and really helps the overall understanding of cultures. My favorite professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	3	5	5	5	690988	10/19/05	My favorite professor and my favorite class thus far. His tests you definitely have to study for, and you have to take notes. He puts up images on a website he gives you on the first day of class and he expects you to check the readings and images on the site and mentions when he updates it. Very knowledgable and very honest.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	131	4	5	5	5	690988	10/18/05	the guy looks like a member of an 80's hair metal band, but he's mad intelligent and always answers questions students may have, no matter how many times he has to repeat himself as a result of it... one of the best professors around
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	110	4	5	5	5	690988	9/9/05	No Comments
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Anthony Anadio	4.2	2	History	130	3	5	5	5	690988	10/3/05	His may look kinda odd, but he knows what he's talking about and his lectures are very interesting.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	David Andersen	2.4	0	Public Policy	504	4	1	1	2	991797	10/1/12	Very, very disoriented. Will suddenly jump from mathematics to group roleplaying to strategic management(SWOT) and so on. homework instructions are hard to understand.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	David Andersen	2.4	0	Public Policy	508	3	1	2	1	991797	7/20/10	HORRIBLE!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	David Andersen	2.4	2	Public Policy	507	1	4	4	2	991797	2/9/08	No Comments
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	David Andersen	2.4	2	Public Policy	615	3	5	4	4	991797	10/2/11	Very helpful and interesting. Provided practical and hands on matierial that is realtable to everyday use. In many ways was more of a mentor than a professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	David Andersen	2.4	0	Public Policy	499	1	1	1	3	991797	6/4/10	What a poor communicator.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bridget Anderson	4.0	2	Sociology		2	5	5	4	1023698	10/8/11	Incredible professor. Yes, she does give weekly tests and an end of year paper -- but they are easy if you do the readings and go to class. Don't expect to slack off in this class, it's tough, but very informative and interesting!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bridget Anderson	4.0	1	Sociology	370	3	3	3	5	1023698	8/29/07	This woman is a witch. I do not recomend you take her social demography class. Gives quizzes every week, and most of all a pain in the butt country paper. Do yourself a big favor stay away if you want a decent grade.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry	220	1	4	5	4	925041	12/26/08	I took organic 1 in summer session and it was extremely hard. His teaching was ok but I dont recommend taking his class during summer. There was over 200 ppl in class however only 9 ppl got A or A- and 50ppl failed & 50ppl dropped the course
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry	100	5	5	4	2	925041	1/9/08	Straightforward teaching, uses powerpoints and will basically tel you what you need to know for tests and quizzes. If you have any prior knowledge of Chemistry at all, even if you were bad at it like I was, you will get an A. He does NOT deal with cheating and would not accept quizzes of those he thought were guilty of it. Good, easy gen-ed class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry	100	4	5	5	4	925041	11/13/07	pretty easy class the quizez and test come straight from the lectures and he puts all the power point slides up on web ct so they're no that hard really easy gen ed def. reccomend it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	925041	6/21/07	Attempted Organic I over the summer; he teaches the class as if you were taking it during the regular semester; no exceptions, no cutting corners, it's unbelieveable! Informed us all the average for the 3rd test is usually a 50, what a way to begin the semester! Don't take in the summer unless you're repeating it or you're AMAZING with chemistry!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	1	Chemistry	220	1	3	3	1	925041	4/18/07	He was an o.k. teacher. The subject was really difficult, so that didn't help. He found it amusing when he taught an especially difficult concept that the class didn't understand. I guess he's better than most Organic Chem professors though.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	1	Chemistry	220	1	4	2	2	925041	1/4/07	He seems like a nice guy. He flew by the chapters. He just went to fast for me compared to the other orgo class. But he is really helpful during his office hours.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	0	Chemistry	220	2	2	2	3	925041	12/17/06	Seems like a nice guy at first, but he flys through the material leaving out important concepts, doesnt grade fairly, not helpful in office hours. If you dont have the same passion for the orgo he does, he wants nothing to do with you. Over half the class dropped, and he still refuses to grade on a distrubution. Avoid at all costs.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	4	925041	11/28/08	This gentleman has been showing his effort on his exam paperworks , those are well balanced , you won't die easily comparing with Eric Block or Frank Hauser. It is your choice to disagree , but don't regret after you approached with those 2 so-called professionals.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	1	Chemistry	220	1	1	4	2	925041	8/6/07	tough... walks through rows as test is in progress.. pretty nerve racking while taking exams
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	0	Chemistry		1	1	3	2	925041	5/25/07	very rude,during office hours he said how he wanted to get a section of the class to drop.no curve sometimes 2pts,moves fast,attended every class & read the book,wish i had toscano or musah who was suppose to teach the class.Discourages you as much as possible.Take a different teacher if you can. cut me off from a better grade by .015 strict scale
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry	220	2	5	5	3	925041	1/15/07	very willing to help - clear, detailed--but you MUST do the work to pass.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	3	925041	12/20/06	Of the 158 students who finished the course, there were: 17 A's.......39 B's.......42 C's......42 D's.......18 E's. He is a very hard professor, but if you go to class, take good notes, dedicate 5 hours a week to work you will get an A or B. Overall he is clear and helpful in office hours.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Collin R Anderson	3.6	2	Chemistry	220	2	3	5	5	925041	11/28/06	He is fair and teaches right from the book. grades on a curve (half to whole letter grade). he is very clear during class but teaches really fast (mainly b/c orgo has lots to cover). he's always on schedule. i rarely went to class and never to office hours but with the new orgo book u can teach urself easily. He's 1 of UAlb's better chem professors
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Eric Anderson	3.1	1	Not Specified		2	3	3	2	1520687	12/19/11	He is not a very good teacher. He respects student ideas but grades based upon his criticisms and not upon the quality of the work. He's a nice person but I would not take him if you are trying to get something good out of the class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Eric Anderson	3.1	2	Not Specified	240	3	4	4	4	1520687	7/12/11	Great as a person. I had him his first time teaching. Very interested in what he does & very willing to help. There is A LOT of reading to do so dont expect to roll on by without doing the readings.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Eric Anderson	3.1	2	Not Specified	240	3	5	4	4	1520687	10/26/11	He Hasn't been teaching long, but he is EXTREMELY helpful and respectful of student opinions. If you participate at all, he will value your opinions and never shut you down. Tests are easy if you are able to support your opinions. There is never wrong or right answers with him. Very nice, cool guy. Office hours are helpful.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Eric Anderson	3.1	0	Not Specified	999	3	1	1	3	1520687	3/18/11	Has no clue how to teach.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	3	5	4	1	244606	4/16/10	I have learned so much from taking her class. She was one of the best professors I have had in my college experience. I actually learned a lot from her class and she made me want to be more motivated in my schoolwork. I would recommend taking a class with her, you learn a lot and she is a great teacher. One of the best classes I have ever took.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	540	4	5	5	3	244606	3/19/07	This was a great class. I learned soo much and she is a great professor who knows her stuff. I would highly recommend this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	2	5	4	4	244606	12/29/06	If you take this class seriously and are willing to do the work you will definately get alot out of the class. This professor goes above and beyond in making sure that you understand that learning is a process that is never finished. The workload is tough, but can be done....
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	540	3	5	3	4	244606	11/1/05	She is very smart and you will learn a lot from her. Be prepared to work hard. An assessment portfolio is due at the end of the semester. Her instructions on it can be confusing, but ask her, and she will help you unerstand. Reading responses and portfolio assignments are due for each class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	2	5	5	5	244606	8/30/05	if you are willing to work really hard, this is an awesome class... she really wants to you get the most out of her class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	540	4	5	4	4	244606	3/25/05	The class is structured and she has made her expectations very clear in the syllabus. It's a lot of work, but not that difficult. The class is pretty lively and I have learned a lot!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	2	5	5		244606	12/5/03	By far the best professor on campus. Take the class and you will see for youself. If your afraid of a little work then this isn't the course for you, however if your looking for a class with a great professor, look no further.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	3	5	5		244606	10/29/03	She is the best prof. I have had at this school. She never allows class to be dull, and makes sure you want to learn. As long as you can handle the workload, this is an amazing class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	540	2	3	4	5	244606	8/1/08	I repented taking her class. In the future I would take her class ONLY if it is a required course. Although she is smart and knowledgeable, she is pretty dominating as a person and not approachable. She also passes inconsiderate "personal" comments under the guise of "feedback". All she wants to prove is that hers is the right way.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education	200	3	5	5	4	244606	1/4/07	really cares about her students. loves her job, and it comes across in class. the work is not hard, but there is a lot of it which is the only thing that makes the class challenging.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	1	Education	540	2	3	3	3	244606	11/18/05	Very smart and very dedicated, but doesn't explain aspects of the final project well. Good at asking students questions to make them think, but states a lot of opinions as facts that "we all know" and gets frustrated with dissenters.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	0	Education		1	2	1		244606	5/30/04	not very clear
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education		2	5	5		244606	12/4/03	she is a great Professor, she really cares about her students.Im not gonna lie this is not the course you want to take for 3 easy credits! There is a lot of work you HAVE to do and also you must attend every class!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Heidi Andrade	4.4	2	Education		5	5	4		244606	9/2/03	- Very dedicated to helping her students - The classwork is easy to understand and very relevant to today's issues -loves giving feedback
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History		5	2	2	2	110990	1/28/13	I took her class it was extremely boring. We watched youtube videos all day grades unfairly and poorly conducts the class, she preaches about civility when she has no controll of the class avoid her if you want a good grade in KBCC
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	2	History	287	5	5	5	3	110990	12/15/08	Africa in the Modern world id definitely an easy class. It is hard to understand her accent sometimes but she is really cool. If you speak to her frequently she will help you out with your grade. Class is only once a week. Easy questions on midterm and final.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	2	2	4	110990	12/1/06	Third world, i dropped the class after 2. there were a ton of group projects and novels to read and it seemed like more of an english class because you have to analyze chapters than an aaas. very boring, very uptight. glad i dropped it

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	1	1	2	2	110990	5/19/05	Steer clear of this woman, she is unnapproachable, unsympathetic, and unreasonable. One of the worst teachers I've had in my entire student career. She makes you read three fiction novels for a history class and tests you on extremely specific information as opposed to concepts. STAY AWAY FROM HER!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	1	1	2	110990	4/28/05	She had no control over her class. It made it very hard to take her lessons seriously. Her TA was an actual joke and spent the full hour checking out the girls in the front row.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	4	1	1	2	110990	11/4/04	the class is a joke. just read the books carefully. everyone cheats on the tests and she is oblivious.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	1	History	287	3	3	3		110990	5/25/04	problems with disrespectful students made this class hard to learn in, prof is very, very knowledgable regarding material but often taken advantage of, possibly b/c of thick accent, could be great teacher/mentor for serious students
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	1	1		110990	12/12/03	What a moron. and the TA i had was a **** on wheels. The class is complete bs though
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	2	History	101	1	5	5	3	110990	2/12/09	Excellent teacher and a plethora of work. The group assignments help solidify what you have read and learned.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	300	4	3	1	3	110990	1/23/07	Africa in the Modern World was a very easy class although it is hard to understand her. Easy questions on the mid-term and final. She also gives 2 optional extra credit assignments.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	4	1	1	4	110990	5/11/06	Rambles on and on without regard for syllabus. Ends class an hour early or 10 mins late. New unanounced assignments almost every other week.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	2	1	1	2	110990	5/23/05	The comments below mine are exactly right. I had hopes before the class that the info about her wasnt all true...but it was. She should not have a teaching degree, let alone a Doctorate! If your looknig for a history elective or "Regions beyond...", choose another class ASAP
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	1	1	1	110990	5/4/05	Worst class ever...I advise you not to take this class. I took it spring 05 semester thinking it was gonna be easy cause that was what i heard...WRONG. U cant understand the teacher and her tests are impossible.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	4	1	1	5	110990	11/30/04	was mildly interested in modern African history, I believe that in the 21st century we will have to deal with many issues in Africa. what issues did Apena cover in her course? yams. and how they fit into african trade. she regurgitates most points. she could cover most of her points in one class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	2	History	287	4	3	4	4	110990	10/19/04	very knowledgeable professor, but a lot of problems with discipline. Only take her class if you're motivated - and if accent doesn't bother you! I thought she was great.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	1	1		110990	5/11/04	absolute waste of time...she missed the last three classes and the final was impossible...the TA was no help either
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	247	3	1	1		110990	11/21/03	the worst class I have ever taken
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	2	1		110990	11/16/03	Has absolutely no control over the class. The TA bails her out all the time.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Adeline Apena	1.9	0	History	287	3	1	1		110990	11/12/03	Don't ever take anything with her

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ivana Alexandrova	1.0	0	Mathematics	214	1	1	1	3	1673498	5/17/12	Worst teacher I've ever had, period. Tests are multiple choice (LAZY), but RIDICULOUSLY hard. She is the only math teacher who gives you 1 attempt on webassign for HW which is 25% of your final grade. If you love 30-45min awkward silences EVERY class and being berated and made fun of then take this class with her. If not, avoid her like the plague
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ivana Alexandrova	1.0	0	Mathematics	108	5	1	1	1	1673498	5/16/12	Alexandrova is a very boring teacher. She whispers when she takes attendance. However her test are super easy because she is the only stats teacher that gives multiple choice questions. I recommend her class but make sure u bring food and a big drink because u will fall asleep. Trust me.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	381	3	5	5	3	233066	1/18/12	Teacher is awesome!!! I was pretty nervous about the class but a week into I felt much more at ease. Her tests aren't hard as long as you study the study guide she gives you inside and out and pay attention to page numbers that she points out, that material def on her tests! Paper was not hard and she was very helpful if you have any questions!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	381	4	5	5	4	233066	8/13/09	Great professor, very nice. Prepare for tests by taking notes in class and learn the review sheet. Organized, very helpful and provides info about grad school and psych careers. The paper wasn't bad.. I got an A. just go to class, you'll be fine
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	381	2	5	5	2	233066	5/19/08	Dr. Altarriba is an amazing professor and will go out of her way to help out her students. She is by far one of the more memorable professors at Suny Albany. There is a lot of material for the class but she is very clear about what you should pay attention to for tests. I highly recommend taking this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	4	1	233066	5/6/08	I really think that we, THE STUDENTS, were a semester long cognitive experiment! She has you MEMORIZE pages and pages of notes. INSANITY! You have to have the EXACT data from the notes/text on the test or she takes points off. We're talking NUMERICAL data and precise graph measurements! If you want to learn, don't take her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	380	3	4	4	1	233066	2/21/06	She is helpful and easy to talk to
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	0	Psychology		1	1	3	3	233066	9/2/05	Do not do anything in her class but pay attention. She did not write me a recommendation to graduate school, although I was second in her class with an A average, because I was not paying attention, and studying for her final and I yawned a few times. She
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		1	5	5		233066	6/14/04	Her syllabus is 11 pages. She is very tough and extremely anal!!! Her exams are hard. Not an easy A. She is however a good instructor and always available for help. Exams are hard but not unfair.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	5		233066	8/12/03	very dedicated to helping students, even though her syllabus makes you think she's going to be tough, she's very flexible if you need extra help or if you need to change a test date. does lots of extra advisement. listen to what she says will be on test
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	381	4	5	5	5	233066	8/12/11	Amazing professor. Even more amazing human being. Couldn't ask for better--and would be difficult to find it. Take anything this professor teaches, and make an effort to work with her in her lab!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	0	Psychology		1	1	1	1	233066	5/20/08	Obviously the other posters fell for Altarriba's phony act! To students other than her favorites, she is not a sweet, caring, mentor-like figure. This class is not worth the amount of effort the Altarriba requires. The most dull subject you could possible CRAM into your head! I strongly recommend AGAINST taking this course!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	4	1	233066	5/6/08	You just MEMORIZE EVERYTHING for the semester and forget directly after the test. As a cognitive psychologist, I would think that she would come to the realization that he class is not LEARNING this way.... Circus act is right! I felt as if I was jumping though hoops!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		2	5	5	5	233066	3/28/07	Dr. Altarriba is like a mentor to me. She'll help you with anything you ask. She wants her students to work hard so she can prepare them for graduate school. Her teaching style is admirable and 100% fair. She is a very kind woman and one of the best teachers at the University.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	5	1	233066	9/23/05	She is the best professor.She is tough and expects the best of her students, but if you work hard she is great. She is the only professor to offer any guidance at SUNY. You know what to expect on her exam, but people say she is hard cuz there are essays and a paper. She expects you to learn, unlike the many psychology teachers and professors.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	233066	10/1/04	I had her as a teacher about 10 years ago! I realized even then, and more so now after earning a Ph.D. in Psychology, how great a teacher she was/is. Her lectures were organized and informative. She expects you to work hard, yet is very fair. A true a
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology	381	3	5	4		233066	11/3/03	excellent, syllabus is scary on first day but she is always there to help her students even with questions not related to class topics
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeanette Altarriba	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	5		233066	7/24/03	The best of the best! Challenging, but always willing to help!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Komla  Amegashie	4.5	2	French	102	4	5	4	4	1762382	11/6/12	Very helpful and really wants all his students to get an A. He knows his stuff and is well organized with the way he runs his classes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	224	5	5	5	5	1659049	11/29/12	Great class, great professor. Pretty easy A and will definitely work with you if you have any problems.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	224	5	5	5	4	1659049	11/2/12	Honestly, he's a beautiful guy inside and out. Take his class and see for yourself.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	144	5	5	5	3	1659049	4/20/12	Overall, this was a great class. I enjoyed Reading Shakespeare more after taking the class. The professor is one of the nicest I've ever met. He is very helpful. You must do the readings,(Sparknotes if you like) you will get tested on identifying a passage and what play it comes from and explain the meaning. There are two papers but the topics are fairly easy. Great class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	144	2	5	4	3	1659049	11/9/12	Basically the most attractive teacher at U of Albany.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	144	5	5	5	5	1659049	8/29/12	I loved Michael's Shakespeare class, so insightful! I've always loved reading Shakespeare and he made the readings and the class super fun. Glad I took his class! I will take any class that he is teaching.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Amrozowicz	4.9	2	English	144	5	5	5	3	1659049	12/5/11	This is probably the easiest class to do well in. He gives very easy tests and participation is not mandatory. He is extremely sweet and very willing to help you with anything. There are 2 papers, 4-6 pages each, and 4 tests, each worth 10 points. This is a shakespeare class so you can def read the plays on spark notes. GREAT CLASS!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	3	5	4	2	1053060	12/18/12	I took an Anthropology class in High School so I was hoping to continue it in college. This is an intro to Anthropology so it was quite boring at times as I had already gone over most of it. There tends to be a lot of reading from the textbook, anywhere from 1-3+ chapters between the two textbooks. Do the readings and take notes and you will pass.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	5	5	5	4	1053060	1/11/12	Professor Andaya's class is one you will definitely enjoy. She is a very fun, young woman who enjoys what she talks about. The only problem I had with the class was with the discussion class (which is mandatory). My TA was very unclear and refused to communicate with me the majority of the semester. I didn't even know what my grade was by the end.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	1	Anthropology	108	3	3	3	2	1053060	11/15/11	I ofund her tests to be impossible, but as long as you do the four (super easy) essays, you can still get above an 80 even if you fail the tests. She's really helpful and attendence isn't mandatory. Plus she's from New Zealand so her accent was cool!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	364	2	4	4	3	1053060	12/15/09	Pleasant, sincere, genuine.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	5	5	5	2	1053060	1/29/09	Great teacher, not another grad student professor. Really helps you learn. I got a B+ off hardly doing reading just based on the in depth explanation and interesting material /presentation. (freshman year my bad) As long as you put in SOME effort you should get a A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	364	3	5	5	4	1053060	3/12/08	Amazing class. You really learn a lot about the world. She assigns great books to read(2). This class had no test only 3 papers (2 3-4 pagers and one 8-10 page final). I hate to write papers but the class is so great its well worth the torture of writing them. She knows a lot and is interesting to listen to. Highly recommended.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	5	5	5	3	1053060	1/25/12	Wonderful teacher who is very clear on everything. The only class I never wanted to skip. As long as you take the notes during class, the exams are very easy. I never study and got an A. The discussions were the only downside, mostly because my TA was quite boring.Not the professors fault though. Would recommend this class to anyone.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	2	3	4	4	1053060	11/15/11	Uses 9780078035029 and 97802056458 books heavily. Go to class, listen, take notes because she doesn't put them online. She's really a sweet person. There isn't much to it. If you pay attention and study for the exams, you'll do fine. Discussions can be a b**** because you have to write 4 papers, but if you follow the guidelines, you'll be fine.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	0	Anthropology	364	1	1	3	5	1053060	5/16/11	At first I thought she was a great instructor. Her lectures seemed interesting, until she realized no one could stand how boring her class was, then she started being rude. She favors women, and will flat out ignore you if your hand is raised if she does not favor you, even if you are an excellent student who contributes well to the class....I ha
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	364	1	4	5	5	1053060	5/19/09	I took ANT108 and 364 with Dr. Andaya and loved both classes. She is a great lecturer; you can tell she loves her subject. The amount of reading she assigns can be a bit overwhelming, and not always necessary, but at least it is interesting. And if she sees you putting a lot of effort into the class she will be helpful and kind!! Great teacher!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	3	5	4	1	1053060	4/10/08	Gen Ed, did not like the class. But one can tell she puts a lot of effort into her lectures and tried to explain things well. Really tried to get people interested in the material. Way to much reading for a 100 level class, 3 books at almost $150!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Elise Andaya	4.2	2	Anthropology	108	3	5	5	3	1053060	11/11/07	Prof. is amazing. She does a great job providing visual examples to what she teaches. Her teaching style is really great and she makes the information and material interesting and really fun to learn about. Probably the most interesting course i have taken here and it's mainly because how easy it is to understand the work. REALLY WONDERFUL CLASS
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	608	2	5	5	5	955796	4/28/10	a fantastically dedicated, knowledgeable, personable educator. If you take a class with her, you will come out knowing and understanding the material regardless of the difficulty of the content. the absolute best of the best!!! I wish they would give her an award.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	702	2	5	5	5	955796	8/31/09	Very caring, helpful, and knowledgeable about the subject matter.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	608	4	5	5	4	955796	2/26/08	One of my favorite library school professors. Truly interested in her students and the subject. We could use more like her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	608	3	5	5	2	955796	2/4/07	She is a good professor, she knows what she is talking about. She crams information into every second of the class!!! She is a bit hyper...we did not like each other much personally, but I did learn a lot...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	608	2	4	4	2	955796	3/14/10	The professor worked to have us learn & never looked down on those of us that did not have an easy time.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	605	2	5	5	4	955796	4/25/09	My favorite professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Andersen	4.9	2	Information Science	605	3	5	5	4	955796	10/22/07	Great Professor, very hyper and funny. very organized. lots of work but fair grader. no quizzes or tests. great personality.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	112	2	5	5	5	1390292	10/13/12	Had her for both 112 and 113. She is really helpful in office hours if need further clarification than class. Amazing teacher and would recommend her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	113	3	5	4	4	1390292	5/2/12	Shes cool, very easy to relate too. i would suggest showing up to class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	112	3	4	4	3	1390292	12/22/10	She's a good teacher, and she's really understanding. Calc is just tough. Most kids took calc in high school which messes with the curve. She's always willing to help and teaches pretty clearly (although she does get confused sometimes). She's funny and sarcastic. The key is to work hard and identify concepts you don't understand.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	0	Mathematics	108	4	2	2	4	1390292	7/29/10	She tries really hard, but she doesn't fully understand the material she teaches so it makes it difficult for the class to understand what she's trying to convey. Often she'll teach something then have to go back later to correct her previous statement since whatever she wrote on the board is actually the opposite of what is true or just incorrect.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	113	1	3	4	2	1390292	5/22/12	Calc 2 just sucks at albany. shes not bad. "No Mercy"
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	112	3	5	5	4	1390292	11/2/11	Carly is very enthusiastic about the subject and is extremely clear when explaining things. She encourages questions and will gladly discuss the material. Whenever I stop by her office, even not during office hours she is glad to help me. After taking her class I literally switched my major to math. Thank You Carly
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Carly Anderson	4.0	2	Mathematics	112	3	4	4	5	1390292	12/19/10	Okay, I feel that this teacher deserves a better rating. I had her for Calc I and I think she is one of the best math teachers there. Just do all the homework, and use her office hours and the tutoring center and you should get an A or B in the class. You should also try to attend every class so you won't be lost on her weekly quizzes and tests.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	1	Psychology	329	2	2	3	4	372211	5/9/10	The class is very interesting but Dr. Anderson is useless. The tests are hard and the final is 100 questions.He gave us a pointless review sheet that was so broad. OH and he takes forever to put up grades
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	331	5	5	5	2	372211	1/15/10	Easy class. I thought it was very interesting and loved going to class. The tests were not bad and its not hard to get an A. If you go and listen in class, take notes, and look them over before the test, there is no need for the text book. He really bases everything off of the test. Great teacher, great class. (Health Psychology)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	4	4	5	4	372211	6/11/08	I went into Health Psych not knowing what to expect. But Dr. Anderson made the class interesting--I learned a ton of info that has stuck with me beyond writing answers on a test. He doesn't BS about what he knows and doesn't know--which is refreshing. You'll have to go to class and pay attention but it'll be worth it. Great class and standout prof!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	1	Psychology	329	4	1	4	4	372211	5/14/08	I really like this guy, but he was way off his game this semester. He was always late, we waited forever for our grades, he was less than helpful. You have to write down everything he says, because that is where the tests come from. He doesn't do review sheets. He's funny and he's clear, but something else was on his mind this year.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	338	4	4	5	4	372211	1/8/07	abnormal psy was easy aslong as u went to class and wrote down every single thing he says. then u dont even have to read the text book. it was very interesting and my favoirte class ever
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	2	5	5	5	372211	11/14/06	IF you like learning he will lecture and you will learn! *Advice* don't take early in the morning unless you are a morning person or on some sort of stimulant...lol
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	3	5	4	4	372211	4/20/06	Keeps class interesting and tests are pretty easy
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		3	3	5	5	372211	11/25/05	hes a really nice guy and really knows his stuff. if you study the notes youll do fine on his tests.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	4	5	5	5	372211	10/23/05	What does hot or not have anything to do with teaching rating?
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	320	4	3	4	4	372211	9/28/05	Very Easy class, take good notes and read the book, you'll get an A in his class. For his Final; go over at his office and go thru your old exams a few times, he has the same questions.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	4	4	4	2	372211	1/22/10	No mandatory attendance. You can easily pull a A-/B+ with just the textbook. All multiple choice tests. Drops the lowest grade. You'll need some of the lecture material to get that A though. His lectures are normal no surprises. If you like the subject he'll keep you interested.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	330	3	4	4	4	372211	8/21/08	He read book back to us and found it useful to defend laurie feldman to have stigmatize me. I would take this class with somebody else. I do not need to pay all this money to have book read back to me. He does not fully understand views set forth by Tom Szasz, MD.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	3	3	5	5	372211	6/2/08	Loved this class! His notes are great and he keeps the class engaged throughout the lecture. He never responded to emails which was annoying but had easy to get to office hours. If it is important to you, he lets class out early frequently! Awesome class and professor
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	338	2	5	4	5	372211	4/7/07	Dr. Anderson is the best psych prof. at Albany. I had him for both health psych and abnorm. psych. There are no suprises and the way he sets up his class you will have no problem passing.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	327	3	5	5	5	372211	11/14/06	Dr. Anderson is very clear in his lectures and fun to listen to !
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		4	5	4	5	372211	5/8/06	I loved this class, and he was awesome, and I think he's hot. Bald but hot.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	4	4	5	5	372211	3/4/06	i was in shock to see that Dr. Anderson is only considered average. his class is amazing... i learned so much from his class. as others commented if u study his notes u can pass his class without a problem. also his sense of humor is dry sarcasm so if u like that style u'll enjoy his class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	329	3	5	5	4	372211	11/23/05	Very detailed and to the point.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		2	4	4	5	372211	10/10/05	amazing class, tons of great info., great professor.. test, studying is a must.. but not horrible- highly reccomend class and prof.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		3	4	4	5	372211	8/31/05	VERY good class and very interesting. But the tests were VERY hard! Although, I still recommend it!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		3	4	5	5	372211	8/31/05	he's a funny guy. if you don't like him you're probably not bright enough to catch on to dry humor. and maybe you shouldn't be in college.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	1	Psychology	327	4	2	3	4	372211	5/26/05	He was ... okay.. but donno y the tests were kinda.. not my type ( i would say..)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology		3	3	4	3	372211	1/26/05	His tests are fair, but his notes go on for ever. The things he says can be summed up into a few words. Social Support is good and learn how to use it. I would recommend him as a prof. to take if you need the requirement.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	0	Psychology		3	2	2	1	372211	1/3/05	some aspects were easy... the tests could have been easy... but sometimes the material is soo boring that i can't study anymore... but he did try to keep the class interesting so that was a plus...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	1	Psychology		1	3	2	4	372211	12/13/04	Horrible class, the test ?s are so ambiguous. Class is going to bring down my 3.98 psych GPA. Prof doesn't know the material - he will answer questions with an "I think or it's possible." Do not take this class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	0	Psychology		3	1	3	1	372211	8/31/05	No Comments
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	1	Psychology	329	2	1	4	1	372211	4/4/05	exams were overwhelming... other than that it was an interesting class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	0	Psychology		2	1	3	4	372211	1/6/05	I learned a lot from this class, but tests are HARD! I studied for hours and only ended up w/C+. Was not very helpful. I was missing a test grade, he kept sayin he'd send it to me, he never did. Lectures were interesting but I wouldnt recommend him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	327	4	4	4	5	372211	12/28/04	Such an easy class. He gives a lot of notes, but he posts them online... eventually. Its a lot of material but I barely studied and I still got an A-. He gives easy extra credit too. A lot of the tests are stuff you already know anyway, so I would recommend this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Drew Anderson	3.8	2	Psychology	333	4	4	4	5	372211	10/21/04	Very smart. Read book back to us as opposed to outside information. Should also do more group projects in class. Very good class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephen Anderson	4.9	2	Criminal Justice	450	3	5	5	5	401592	12/14/06	He's an awsome Professor, he seems to care about his students, do the reading, come to class (u can skip 1 or 2), its quite interesting, u may actually learn sth,suny should have more professors like him

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephen Anderson	4.9	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	5	401592	12/6/05	:)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Stephen Anderson	4.9	2	Criminal Justice	282	5	5	5		401592	5/5/04	Do the work and see him for help and you'll definately get an A. Very helpful and nice
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Robert Apel	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	5	1264344	4/23/11	Excellent Professor. If you are taking stats, take him!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Robert Apel	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	282	5	5	5	2	1264344	3/25/09	Young guy, but he knows what he's teaching. In-depth powerpoint slides that he'll post on blackboard. Easy going when it comes to making up missed exams. Ends class 20 or so minutes early but covers everything you need to know for the exams.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Robert Apel	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	504	3	5	5	1	1264344	5/2/09	Good teacher, good personality, good notes, and overall quite good. I'm surprised stats was the class I enjoyed the most this semester. I thought the final was based a bit too much on material from our final class (not enough time or sample problems to practice), but prep for the midterm was great, and short class at end-term were quite appreciated
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arthur Applebee	4.0	1	Education	750	2	3	3	4	463191	4/7/12	The class was very student-centered. We were each responsible for facilitating the discussion in a couple of classes based on different readings that we got to choose which covered topics in the course. There was also a lot of student choice and flexibility in what to read and how to demonstrate your understanding.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Arthur Applebee	4.0	2	Education		3	5	5	3	463191	9/22/04	He is a very helpful professor!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ruben Arana-Downs	4.0	2	Theater		4	5	5	5	50279	1/22/06	Ruben is the best. I learned sooooooo much! Also one of the nicest guys around Cannot do the chilli pepper rating because I think he'd find it embarrassing
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ruben Arana-Downs	4.0	2	Theater		3	4	4	5	50279	10/28/04	Ruben is a seriously chill guy. Perhaps TOO chill, but interesting nonetheless. He's definately a major hottie, as well.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	0	Accounting	301	1	2	2	5	125635	6/27/08	She moved to UTC and lasted there a year or two. I had her for Intermediate II, which was torture. Honestly, I believe she enjoys treating students the way she does.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	0	Accounting	311	1	1	1	4	125635	1/26/05	Worst Professor EVER. She 's gone and the sun is shinning again in the Accounting department here at suny Albany
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	0	Accounting	311	2	1	1	3	125635	10/22/04	She looks like the wicked witch from the east. crooked nose and everything. bad teacher she don't care about anyone only about herself
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	2	Accounting	311	1	4	4		125635	4/29/04	She expects a lot from students. Difficult course but if you do the work its not horrible.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	2	Accounting	101	4	4	4		125635	2/3/04	Tough but fair, Do the work and she will work with you.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	1	Accounting	311	1	1	5		125635	7/7/03	she goes too fast, expects too much & doesnt explain enough.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Deborah Archambeault	2.9	1	Accounting		1	3	3	1	125635	9/16/05	She was wicked. She was scary and hard. She did expect a lot but it was too quick of a progression from the intro acc courses.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism		3	4	4	3	1245569	4/11/13	Armao knows her STUFF. She's so smart and educated in her field. While she's not the typical professor, you'll learn a lot from her if you PAY ATTENTION. She may not be typical, but she's top notch and worth your time! No textbook, little writing assignments and 2/3 big projects.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	0	Journalism		2	1	3	3	1245569	7/25/11	Once she's picked favorites, she's set. After that she won't really pay attention to any one else in the class. She seems to not like teaching either because she always brings in speakers or plays movies and doesn't really lecture.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	325	2	5	5	2	1245569	3/17/10	1 of the best professors in journalism. You'll be enganged and will learn. Do the work, give effort & you'll get an A
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	325	3	5	5	5	1245569	12/17/09	Prof. Armao is one of the best teachers in the JRL department. Her class was ALWAYS interesting and varied. She doesn't have powerpoint presentations or long lectures like most Profs but she engages you in whatever subject she picks.Nice personality. Brings lots of guest speakers too. Do her assignments on time. No quizzes :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	475	3	5	4	5	1245569	1/15/09	Professor Armao is experienced, creative, and encourages students to really get into their work. She encouraged students to find solid and interesting story ideas. The in-class exercises and weekly speakers were good teaching methods. You learn a lot because she is helpful and makes students get out to gain reporting experience.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	225	3	5	4	4	1245569	11/13/12	Such an interesting woman! Knows her stuff and is extremely understanding with everything. A few papers and a few quizes. Take this class!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	475	4	5	4	4	1245569	12/14/10	Inv Reporting. Dont buy book. NEVER opened it. EASY class. Brings it several guest speakers. Grade is a book report and one paper you work on all year. Easy grader. Takes attendance sometimes. Knows her stuff!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	350	3	5	5	4	1245569	3/9/10	Ok. so heres the low down on Professor Armao. She is very serious about what she teaches, but thats what makes her class a good time. if you go to class and participate..... your set. just know your way around a map and take notes when speakers come and your golden.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rosemary Armao	4.4	2	Journalism	200	3	5	5	3	1245569	4/7/09	Prof. Armao is very interesting. Loved going to this class. Knows how to get the information to her students in ways they understand.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jennifer Armiger	4.5	2	History	390	4	5	5	5	1500042	4/12/12	Best class and best professor. She's awesome. Take any of her classes. She's a bit of a strict grader but she'll help you out if you ask.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jennifer Armiger	4.5	2	History	390	4	5	4	4	1500042	11/22/10	Wonderful professor! Was the easiest class you can find at a 300 level. Extremely helpful and is a very easy grader. Has a lengthy research paper (10-15 pages) but you have all semester to write it and it's on w/e topic you want. One of my favorite professors. Taking another class with her next semester. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jennifer Armiger	4.5	2	History	325	5	4	4	3	1500042	12/6/11	Four papers, topic of choice. Easy grader. Fifth paper = visit historical site, easy A. Final = two short essays and identification. Gives study guide and word bank. Passes around sign in for attendance, but can miss up to three. Easy A. Definitely take.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	105	5	4	4	3	81281	5/20/09	Dry and dull, perhaps, but that may come with the territory. Granted, the early hours didn't help, nor did his near-monotony... but the class itself was fairly straightforward, and far from difficult. Review questions would often show up again on the tests, which made it easy enough to get on by with a small amount of review.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	0	Geography	105	4	1	2	5	81281	5/17/08	I really wanted to learn in this class, but I only learned how to take tests. Lectures are extremely boring but notes are online, so most people didn't go to class.You only need to study the review questions to know whats on the test. Also grades HW so I paid for the textbook website acsess just for that. Easy A but take Delano's class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	105	4	5	5	5	81281	5/12/07	A good guy. Tests are OK. MONOTONE VOICE!!(puts you to sleep! no joke!) if you fall asleep easily in class, This man is your worst nitemare. Notes are online, uses CourseCompass and posts online review quizzes, a lot of test questions are derived from the ones online. Not that bad of a Professor...

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	1	Geography	100	2	3	2	2	81281	5/27/05	Mess up my overall average by giving me a B-, he is nice and responsible. but his tests r just... unbelievable HARD!! no extra credits, not curve.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	100	3	4	4	4	81281	4/8/05	good class

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	0	Geography	100	2	1	1		81281	9/9/03	I don't even know... I mean I hate this material, but this guy was pretty bad. I passed, but barely, he's not very nice or interesting and the material sure isn't...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	0	Geography	105	5	2	2	1	81281	5/22/08	Puts the review questions online and the review questions are the ONLY questions that are on the test. The same exact questions. Maybe the easiest class ever.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	210	2	4	4	3	81281	11/7/07	Dr. Arnason really knows his stuff. His notes are quite organized. He grades homework which helps to supplement your overall grade. His tests are really hard, mostly because they are too long, however he does curve. He also gives "pop" quizzes, but so far has "hinted" us about what is on them. Don't let the others discourage you.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	100	5	3	5	4	81281	12/1/06	Took planet earth. VERY easy class, all the notes are online and thats all thats on the tests. he wasnt very exciting but he was clear and understandable. Easy a if you have ANY background in earth science, even from highschool
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	100	3	3	4	4	81281	10/9/05	Notes were online, the tests were fair if you went to class fairly regularly and read over the notes. Not overly exciting as a professor, but very knowledgable
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	210	3	4	5	5	81281	9/1/05	Arnason really knows his stuff. His notes are thourough and easy to understand. The tests were always tough, but I think he grades pretty fairly. He's a nice guy too.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	100	2	4	4	2	81281	4/18/05	Tough tests, notes are all online though
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography	100	3	4	4	4	81281	1/5/05	a good guy, knows his stuff. good sense of humor if you're paying attention
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography		4	5	4		81281	4/23/04	He is very helpful, but is a tough grader.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	2	Geography		5	3	4		81281	12/23/03	I dont really remember his class, all i know is that the notes were online and thats all I did and got a B.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	1	Geography	100	4	4	1		81281	6/30/03	The guy knows his stuff, and he's a very kind and knowledgable professor, however HE CANNOT TEACH. This Stanford graduate should just stick to research.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	0	Geography	100	2	1	3		81281	5/29/03	I would have done a lot better if the tests were on the expeditions him and Adam Schoomaker boldly navagated through
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Arnason	3.1	1	Geography		3	3	3		81281	12/27/02	final was nothing like the other tests

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	287	5	2	3	3	805617	1/25/11	Asare is a cool teacher. If you go to every class, take notes from his slides and movies, and read the assigned book early in the semester you are guaranteed a B and up. He gives majority of the questions for the test and final the week before. I recommend his class! Very interesting and easy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	110	5	3	3	1	805617	1/16/11	He's a bit hard to understand, because of his accent, but you'll get used to it. He also has a hard time understanding some of the class conversation if you're talking about technology or some things. If you read the book and half listen in class, you'll be fine.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	2	African Studies	286	5	5	4	4	805617	11/1/10	Professor Asare is the best... gave the questions on the midterm and the final... go to class pay attention and you will be ok. Make sure u ready before class because he gives quizes...IF YOUR LOOKING FOR AN EASY A TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	286	5	3	2	3	805617	3/15/10	Super nice guy. He is from Ghana and is difficult to understand at times. He is not your stereotypical teacher. I just read from Asante and go to class and get A's. I do see a fair amount of people get C's though who do not study. Some work required but he does give you test questions before so it is your fault if you do bad. Enjoyed the class alot
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	286	4	3	3	1	805617	3/27/07	Pretty cool guy, has a major accent and really hard to understand him but it gets easier if you go to class, attendence is random
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	186	5	3	2	4	805617	1/19/11	VERY VERY EASY COURSE. Almost everyone gets an A. Accent hard to understand but he tries. Has a great sense of humour. Take his class if you can.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	2	African Studies	287	5	4	3	2	805617	11/22/10	Asare is an okay teacher. The class itself is easy, just pay attention in class. He gives every single question on the midterm for you to study the week before the test. His accent is not the difficult to understand. He's an easy going teacher, he's just really annoying when it comes to leaving class early or sleeping or talking in class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	0	African Studies	286	3	1	1	4	805617	4/2/10	He's tough on grading and hard to understand until you get used to his accent, but he's funny. Be prepared to pick through the textbooks for random info, take notes fast, and memorize.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	1	African Studies	286	5	2	3	3	805617	6/16/08	THe class is very boring, but it is an easy A. The first class he makes it sounds like it is hard, but don't let that fool you. Don't bother reading. He announces his "pop quizzes" a week before he gives them. For the midterm and the final he gives you every question that will be on the exam. I just googles them and got a 100 on both exams.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Asare	2.7	0	African Studies		5	3	1	1	805617	2/27/07	THIS GUY! Really easy class, but he really didn't know what was going on. He didn't know anything unless he had his notes in front of him. I always sat in the same spot, and halfway thru the semester he asked me if I was actually in his class or not. "I haven't seen you before", he said. What? This guy was crazy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mitch  Aso	1.5	0	History	389	2	2	1	5	1766069	11/13/12	It is his first year teaching at UA, he is an awful teacher who is incomprehensible. He makes you do ALL busy work. He changes deadlines for huge research papers last minute, and adds on work that is not in the syllabus. He lectures way too fast and commonly has to go back to previous lectures n correct himself. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jaimee Atkinson	4.5	2	Art	105	4	5	4	4	1581715	5/17/11	She's really nice, and pretty laid back. No complaints about her, but be warned that Art 105 is a studio class, meaning it's 6 hours a week of class time for 3 credit hours, and you need to spend 2-3 hours on each homework assignment (so it takes up 10-12 hours a week). If you're going for an art gen-ed, you might want to try an art history class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Susan Appe	4.5	2	Public Policy	140	4	4	5	4	1682971	1/11/12	Very nice and friendly professor. Always willing to provide assistance. Lectures are clear and the material is straightforward.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Berhane Araia	2.6	2	African-American Studies	612	4	5	3	5	992514	12/12/12	Someone saying Pr Araia "is not Einstein" on this specific class hasn't done any work. Pr Araia has a very peculiar insight into the topic of "Race" and tries to make people think beyond what they know. But some don't get it, bc they get stuck with their petty knowledge and stereotypes. I learnt a lot, even though I knew a lot before this class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Berhane Araia	2.6	0	African-American Studies	342	3	1	2	1	992514	12/19/08	This class was useless. The most boring part of my whole week. I did not learn anything from him and his concepts were meaningless. One day in class he turned off the lights and put a youtube video up of another professor teaching from Columbia-attendence is required.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Berhane Araia	2.6	2	African-American Studies	331	5	5	3	4	992514	4/30/08	Loved this professor. I learned a lot from him. People are just lazy and do not want to do the work. Class based on discussions, which is apart of the participation. Talk a lot and you will definetly get an A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Berhane Araia	2.6	0	African-American Studies	611	1	1	1	1	992514	5/15/07	This man sucks when it comes to teaching! He made the class' entire semester a living hell! He gives concepts but doesn't teach us how to apply them, and when we ask him to do so, he himself messes up. The worst part is that he makes you feel dumb when you ask for help.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Emrah Arbak	4.2	2	Economics	355	3	4	4		292516	11/19/03	I had Emrah Arbak for Public Finance. This is a fairly challenging class but as long as you keep up to date on the reading you'll be fine. He curves at the end. He takes attendance randomly and only adds points to your average and doesn't subtract them
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mary Arcidiacono	2.5	1	Education	460	2	2	3	2	1554086	3/28/11	nice instructor, interesting class.She tries hard to make sure the subject is comprehensible to every student. She is extremely invested in her subject, however she gives lots of BUSY WORK. I don't find some of the assignments helpful or necessary. I wouldn't recommend if you are looking to fulfill your gen-ed requirement.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Michael Armato	5.0	2	Political Science	140	4	5	5	4	1294304	10/5/09	Good professor - class and tests are easy as long as you show up to class, pay attention, and take good notes. Exams are essay based and he gives study guides.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	1	1	1	1	446257	12/3/12	Very confusing and hard. If you miss a class you will feel like you missed a week's lesson.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	5	5	5	3	446257	11/2/11	Armour-Garb is the man. He is a D-J logician hybrid. He is a family man. He is my favorite professor ever. I am taking his 400 level course next semester despite me being a freshman. When I wake up on tuesdays and thursday I do not dread going to class, I embrace it. His class is completely stress free, a rarity in college, yet we learn alot!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	5	3	446257	12/22/10	He's a great professor, even for those who do not particularly enjoy logic. He's very willing to help his students. So nice, I definitely recommend him!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	4	4	446257	4/11/10	Fun, quirky, weird and entertaining -- for logic.Care's a lot. Nice to look at.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	4	5	4	5	446257	5/7/09	material may seem hard but it's real easy. I kinda like it when the TA teaches the class rather than him cuz he talks so slowly and his voice is so calming that i fall asleep. Be sure to go to every class, cuz he is tricky w/ the HW. Hes a chill guy tho, but sometimes I get a lil nauseous seein him down his daily king-sized jug of soda every class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	515	3	5	4	3	446257	12/4/08	I LOVE THIS GUY!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	4	5	1	446257	5/25/08	Weird, interesting, funny and very nice to look at. He goes off topic sometimes but sometimes that makes things hilarious. Cares a lot about logic. Maybe too much?
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	1	2	2	1	446257	1/14/08	He means well and is a nice guy. The class on the other hand is horrible he moves fast and teaches in a strange way, TA was helpful. I left the class not learning one thing the only thing that helped me was the ridiculous curve he put on the class. Don't take this class unless you absolutely need to!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	5	5	3	5	446257	7/3/07	I love this guy! He is an awesoem prof. who really gets into the material. He gives little quizes and homework to keep you on track. If you ever need help just meet with him - he is extremely caring and available. Also, very funny guy with very odd hand gestures! Love the AG!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	518	3	5	3	4	446257	3/17/07	Brad is awsome. The handouts may be better than the discussion, though, as far as clarity goes. The subject can get tough, so it is helpful when there are ready ways to break it down or simplify into such outlines...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	2	4	4	4	446257	7/17/12	Awesome teacher. I would definitely recommend him if you actually understand logic. If you don't, its a really hard class. He usually holds reviews before every test and uses the same examples at the reviews & on the test. Midterm was take home. Final was kind of hard but he lets you bring a cheat sheet.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	4	2	446257	3/4/11	It doesn't really seem fair because he was a great professor teaching a very difficult class. Unless you EXCELLED at Algebra and many other aspects of math, this is a very difficult class for anybody. I was one of a dozen or so students who were generally lost and confused.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	1	Philosophy	210	2	3	2	1	446257	11/19/10	Hilarious. Love him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	4	3	2	446257	3/9/10	I love him. He's so entertaining. The class is difficult though so make sure you go everyday and take good notes. Group quizes/homework.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	201	5	5	5	5	446257	3/24/09	the subject is boring but it's logic! he teaches it well however and throws in jokes that GRAB my attention! I have to admit he is a little bit intimidating to talk to in office hours or personally because he acts EXACTLY like my buddy whose had too many LSD trips and would get regular flashbacks and you cant anticipate whats gonna happen.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	515	2	5	3	3	446257	12/4/08	Such a great Professor! So incredibly knowledgeable and helpful!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	2	2	2	1	446257	5/20/08	Sigh, this was the class I dreaded going to but went so I wasn't worse off than I already was. He is funny but a little odd, can't quite figure him out. His TA was my saving grace, I prob would of failed if he wasn't there to help. You never know his grading scale even at the end. Logic is tough and his crazy antics don't help. Nice guy but that it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	2	5	4	2	446257	11/2/07	extremely willing to explain material to students. although logic is hard, he is so helpful.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	418	4	4	4	5	446257	3/23/07	Brad doesnt know whether something is true, false, true and false, true or false, or something in bewteen. How does a guy who holds a statement to possibly be both true and not true at the same time end up teaching?
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	5	4	446257	6/5/06	Hard class but fair. Funny, but not always interesting (as if logic is always interesting!). Go to office hrs. and you will be fine
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	2	2	1	2	446257	6/2/06	I don't know how there's a smiley face next to Brad's name. I have never given a negative review of a professor before this, but everything about the class was just awful. He makes everything way more complicated than it needs to be and tests on material that was hardly covered in class. AVOID THIS CLASS.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	410	2	5	5	3	446257	2/24/06	Dr. Armour-Garb is one of the best professors I've had--I'd definitely recommend taking a class with him :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	3	3	446257	12/21/05	I can't really say that this class was hard because he put such a huge curve on our grades.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	410	3	4	5	5	446257	8/31/05	he's smarter than you. i don't care who you are. he is smarter than you.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy		1	1	1	1	446257	5/6/05	Hard Class! Doesn't Make Sense! Needs To Stay On Topic
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	4	4	4	3	446257	1/13/05	brad is a little prone to tangents but they're usually somewhat relevant and amusing... i think he's a fair grader though, and would definitely recommend him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	4	1	1	4	446257	10/26/04	He is not very logical. He makes no sense. He rambles on and on and he feels the need to bring his political views into everything. I wish he'd shut up.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	2	5	5		446257	9/8/04	That prof is really interesting and fantastic to look at. Take his course, even if you are not a philosophy major!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	1	2	2	1	446257	3/21/06	Okay Logic is officially HELL. That**** is soooo BEYOND confusing that no matter what you're probably going to end up HATING the class. He seems like a nice guy but the material is such bull**** that you end up hating him. I'm not saying don't take a class with him, just don't take LOGIC.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	4	5	4	5	446257	12/26/05	Brad is a very intelligent prof. who often goes above teh heads of many and explains thing sin ways that make material way more complicated than it needs to be. However, quiz's and tests are fair as long as you keep up withthe material and reading. Also, ther eis a big curve so don't get scared if you get a little lost. Over all great prof. who rea
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy		2	4	5	3	446257	10/9/05	im so freakin lost!!!! AGGRHHHHH
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy		4	4	3	1	446257	7/28/05	He a good teacher but the subject is just really boring. His tests are fair and he is always willing to help you out if your introuble. For this class try and go always, it is really easy to fall behind.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	4	446257	4/5/05	smart, great guy. there to help. just go to class and skim the readings. as long as you feel you have a good understanding of the material which doesn't take much you are guaranteed an A
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	2	5	5	1	446257	10/26/04	Brad has all of the students call him by his first name(which is cool). His class is interesting and can be hard, but his understanding of logic is so profound that I am sort of in awe. Also, he's really cute and (sometimes) funny (at least he tries!).
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	4	5	5	5	446257	10/16/04	great guy! Very helpful, brilliant in general.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bradley Armour-Garb	3.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	5		446257	8/26/04	Did you catch him in the newspaper?
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English	210	3	3	2	2	215763	7/1/12	She is a good professor. Very intelligent and can be intimidating. This might sound stupid but she uses really big words and sometimes it was hard to know what she was talking about because she used such great speaking. I really liked her though and I learned a lot in this class. It's hard manageable and you really take literary skills from it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	0	English	310	1	2	2	1	215763	9/9/11	Whoa. Stay away! I did well in the class, but that doesn't really say much... this class was super abstract and difficult. The professor was very vague about many assignments and I can't really say I learned a whole heck of a lot. Good luck if you sign up for this.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	310	1	5	3	4	215763	9/20/08	THis woman is amazing. I go into class after reading, and usually do not always understand the material, and by the end of class I know exactly whats going on! She WILL NOT move on from a subject unless she is SURE that everyone is with her, which is awesome. the class is tough, but she will help you through it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English	210	1	3	3	2	215763	2/29/08	Difficult, boring class but she got me through it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English		2	4	4	5	215763	1/23/06	Arsic is a challenging professor but a fair one.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English		2	5	5	5	215763	10/4/05	Branka Arsic is the first teacher i've ever had that had a lasting impact on me, I've never felt a connection with a teacher like I did with professor Arsic. She was able to put the many things i've always had running through my mind into perspective because of how well she can articulate her thoughts. There was definitely a noticable change in my life after taking both of her classes. I can relate almost everything in my life to something I learned in her classes. Everyone should take a class with her.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	3	5	5	5	215763	8/24/05	Professor Arsic is a great, understanding and very articulate professor. I would love to just talk to her again, taking a class w/her would be excellent.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	435	3	5	5	4	215763	6/23/05	Definetely one of the greatest professors I've ever had. Still thinking about that class to this day (and I graduated). Intimidating at first and very opinionated, but she dares to be different and gets her students thinking. A+
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English	337	2	2	3	4	215763	10/25/11	Be careful about this professor. Grading was based on 5 random, surprise quizzes each worth 15% of your grade and a final 4-page paper. We did not actually have the first quiz until over halfway through the semester, meaning you get no grade-based feedback until that point.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	4	4	3	4	215763	5/8/11	Based in theory. Wonder at breadth of intellectual inferences.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English	310	2	2	3	5	215763	5/21/08	Difficult professor, very vague about what will be done in class; the syllabus becomes useful around week three. Definitely of an elitist mentality, it's a routine of hers to advise students to drop the class on the first day. Also, unless you're weak-minded, this class won't change your life. Astonishingly, I got a decent grade in the class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	2	4	3	4	215763	9/2/06	Found course VERY challenging. Others in class were Sr and just trying to finish. Branka didn't seem to like them much. Very helpful if you show genuine intrest.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	4	5	4	3	215763	10/17/05	Awesome, funny teacher
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English		1	5	5	5	215763	9/27/05	I used my brain so much in this class, and it felt damn good. Arsic is super smart and is lenient on those who take the class seriously and have good ideas. If you're not into learning, step away. But if you want to really think, Arsic will show you the way.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English		2	3	3	4	215763	8/24/05	oh man, transcendentalism with this lady was the biggest headache i could have ever had, especially in a condensed summer class. but i got an A, so it couldn't've been too bad.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	343	2	3	4	3	215763	5/19/05	i don't know how clear she seemed to other people, but what she said about emerson and how she incorporated him into his time/place was informative and challenging to grasp. i enjoyed her class immensely, even if it wasn't the easiest one i've ever taken
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	0	English		4	1	1	5	215763	4/25/05	thinks she's a femme fatale-not!She really doesn't know what she's talking about or how to teach.Who hired this person? I wish the English dept. would get some more real professors like Berman and Bosco who "like" literature and don't feel the need to massacre it with "so-called" high theory.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	4	4	5	1	215763	10/28/04	If you ever have an opportunity to take a course with Branka, it is completely worth it. She's easily one of the most gifted and interesting professors on campus. She's always writing cool books and it seems as though her knowledge never ends. Totally a hip chick.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	1	English	210	3	3	3		215763	4/28/04	was very rude the first day of classes, tries to discourage students from taking course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	2	4	4		215763	12/12/03	The class was hard, but it's supposed to be. She knows what she's talking about and I learned alot from her. Pretty interesting
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	3	5	5		215763	5/24/03	this is a tough class but she makes it easy and fun
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	4	5	5	2	215763	3/16/05	Best professor that I've ever had at SUNY Albany. Very good books. To be completely honest, the class changed my life. You should not graduate without experiencing this wonderful human being.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	210	3	4	5		215763	5/4/04	stick with this class, she's fun, the class is interesting, you actually learn and its worth it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Branka Arsic	3.7	2	English	542	2	4	5		215763	2/12/04	Overall, very interesting course from an intense prof. Lots of reading, but great books.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	5	460938	2/21/13	INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR. Most of these students that rated Asal negatively are: 1. lazy and/or 2. not majoring/interest in poli sci. This is college, people. The professor challenges u and is always there to help you. People want an easy A but you need to actually work for it. If you don't have the slightest interest nor work ethic, this isn't for u
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	1	1	1	1	460938	1/8/13	HATED THIS CLASS! I was so confused with his style of teaching. His quizzes count for 20 percent of the grade I scored a B on the final and a B on a term paper that is worth 300 points out of 1000 and still received a D+ because I missed quizzes that were given @ 8:45 each morning..He turned me off to minoring in political science. worst class EVER
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	2	2	3	1	460938	12/11/12	This guy is terrible. Makes you write a final paper that counts more than your final and makes absolutely no sense. Spare yourself the time and don't take this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	4	460938	11/26/12	Best professor I have at UA. Lectures are very easy to listen to, and he is very passionate about the subject. I'm not a Political Science major (History for me)but I still find this class fascinating. Always available to help students, just make sure you do the readings. Teaches like a 300 level class, but worth it if you do the work.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	5	460938	5/23/12	This is an AMAZING class. If you're a poll sci major take it with him. Asal got to know everyone in our lecture on a personal level (or tried) which is to your advantage because he's really cool and genuinely wants to help out when he can. If you're not a poll sci major this class will be an unnecessarily hard gen ed but definitely worth it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	360	4	5	5	5	460938	4/18/12	Probably the best professor i've ever had. Extremely intelligent with a friendly and approachable demeanor. Really helps you out on understanding concepts and even wrote me a recommendation for some of my applications. Best Poli-Sci teacher at UA
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	4	1	460938	1/11/12	Professor Asal was an awesome professor. He made sure to learn everyone's name and was interactive with the class. His methods helped me learn better than I expected. He gives a grade to reflect the effort put into his class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	4	5	5	5	460938	10/3/11	An outstanding professor, to say the least. Very entertaining, always shows every perspective possible in a way that is straightforward. TA's are wonderful; become their best friends. Read the textbooks and keep up on the notes, which are well-written, and you will do well. Don't be shocked if you walk away seeing things as you never did before.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	260	3	5	5	5	460938	3/29/11	Professor Asal is truly awesome. Having a class with him has been very rewarding and a great experience. He cares a lot about his students' success in and outside the classroom. I can't recommend him enough!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	4	4	460938	12/27/10	Really great teacher. He knows what he's talking about. Sometimes the work load seems more than what should be required bt a level 100 class but when you study and try your hardest you will get something out of it. Attendance MANDATORY, he gives pop quizzes if attendance is under 100. But overall good class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	4	5	4	4	460938	2/15/13	It's a moderately difficult course, but the instruction is great.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	787	3	5	4	5	460938	12/28/12	Best professor at UA. The total teaching package: expert in field, published author, superb teacher, lots of after class time if needed, cares about students.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	5	5	5	3	460938	11/27/12	Class is pretty simple. Ta's do not grade that hard. Informative class, but could be a lot more detailed and rigorous. Disproportional grading in the sense that 50% of the grade is a final and a paper.Lots of small assignments and quizzes. Could be a lot more informative, but it is a 100 lvl class. he says you do 300 level work, but I don't see it
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	4	5	5	3	460938	11/5/12	Easily my favorite class this semester and I had very little interest in the subject before taking the class. He's one of the best teachers I've ever had and he will do EVERYTHING he can to ensure that anyone that actually wants to learn the material does. I would absolutely recommend taking this class, its an 845 and i actual want to go.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	260	3	5	4	4	460938	5/5/12	Asal really knows how to make class interesting! He uses simulations & games to exemplify points made in class, offers lots of extra credit, and is ALWAYS available to help outside class. Really cares about students' opinions & looks for ways to improve. However, not necessarily an easy class. Make sure you can keep up w/ & understand readings!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	554	2	5	4	4	460938	4/14/12	One my favorite teachers at UA. He is extremely knowledgeable and committed to his work. He will challenge his students and has high expectations, but he is very helpful and fair. He tries his best to make the study topics innovative, fun and interesting. Lastly, take your time reading the assigned materials, he will ask you questions on it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	4	2	460938	11/17/11	Extremely Nice Teacher and TA's. Gives easy pop quizzes to benefit those who come to class. Gives a lot of reading outside of class that he expects you to do. Lots of fun activities.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science		3	5	5	3	460938	4/7/11	GREAT PROFESSOR! really does cares about his students and he's very helpful. Workload might be a little much but he's always there to help. Definitely need to read the material before class, attendance is mandatory, he does pop quizzes! DEFINITELY TAKE HIS CLASS!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	5	460938	3/4/11	The man almost had me change my Major with how well he presented and handled the material Superb! prof, engaging, brilliant and has the ability to convey knowledge without any biases if u want a stimulating and strong course, jump on this immediately. Theres is work involved but it never feels like work, only progress on your intellect.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	4	4	4	460938	12/4/10	Asal's work can be hard, and if you don't do the readings or go to class you will be lost and confused. That being said, his lectures are not a reverberation of the books, and include interesting simulations, games and examples. He also takes the time to learn the names of anyone who participates in class (over 300 students in my particular class.)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	100	2	5	5	1	460938	11/4/10	AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! Cares very much about students and will do anything to go out of his way to help a student! Always makes students feel welcome and makes material easy for all students to understand
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	1	5	4	4	460938	12/10/08	Asal is awesome. Essays were tough but if you got help from TA you learned a lot. Very hard class but very intersting. I took it as a gen ed, worked really hard and got an A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	5	460938	8/10/08	No Comments
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	4	460938	5/9/08	Prof Asal is amazing. The only lecture hall prof I had that took time to learn names. He or the TA's were always available for extra help/clarification. Class load wasn't too bad and it's easy if you listen and if you're interested in the subject.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	4	3	460938	4/8/08	Likes to communicate with the students, and attempts to learn names :-) Allows the individual to choose which theories they believe in; interested in student opinion. Very interested in what he teaches; make sure you do the reading or else he gets pissed off. Overall one of the best teachers I've had at Albany sofar.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	2	460938	3/31/08	Teaches very well. The class is fun and interesting.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	4	2	460938	12/13/07	This man is a gem. He has a gift for separating his personal feelings from the issues he discusses. If more professors worked so hard to be fair, objective and were as passionate about scholarship, more students would learn to really think.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	360	2	4	4	4	460938	10/25/07	Prof Asal is the best ever!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	370	4	5	5	5	460938	2/15/07	Prof. Asal, STOP READING THESE! (Yes, he reads this site) Great professor, very accessible and no matter the class size, he will make a point to learn your name. Heavy reading load and since he knows your name, participation is a must. Reminds me way too much of George from Seinfeld...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	450	3	5	5	2	460938	12/14/06	Prof. Asal is a cool guy. He is quite understanding and is open to others thoughts and ideas. He is also upfront about what he teaches to you so that you make no mistake baout what it is that you are supposed to be doing and learning. Overall great guy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	1	5	4	4	460938	12/23/08	Very challenging assignments and grading. However, Asal is a really great guy and helpful outside of class. If you work hard you will learn a lot and enjoy yourself. Included a lot of games/simulations instead of lectures every day, and really seemed to care about the class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	1	3	2	2	460938	10/7/08	He teaches the 100 level course like its a 400 level. And hes crazy about attendance at lectures.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	4	5	5	3	460938	7/25/08	Professor Asal is simply amazing. I took this class just to fulfill a GenEd requirement. But I actually learned so much from it. He is the only professor who tries to learn names in a class of almost 200 and over students. He keeps everyone busy in activities and does his best to make the class interesting. He and all his TAs are helpful inside and
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	4	4	4	460938	4/15/08	Prof. Asal is one of the best prof. i have had so far. Yes his work is on the difficult side, but he is extremly approachable and very halpful if u feel at all confused. Hes also a lil hottie lol. Be advised if you dont the readings you will get lost in lectures, and u wont do well on his quizes either. Also both textbooks are heavily used.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science		2	5	5	5	460938	4/3/08	Not only is he an interesting speaker, Dr. Asal is really good at helping students new to his subject understand what it's really all about . He is patient, informative and kind. He's also a real cutie!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	4	460938	3/29/08	He is the best professor I have ever had and he is hot too!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	4	1	1	4	460938	12/12/07	seems helpful until you ask for help
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	360	2	5	5	5	460938	10/3/07	Probably one of the best teachers, advisors, and mentors that this university has to offer. I have never had a bad class with him and do not forsee it in the future. I would bet that he is one of UAlbany's best assets.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	3	460938	1/11/07	Professor Asal has been the best professor thus far I've had at the university. He helps his students out in any way he can; he even helped students in my class with other classes. He makes the material really interesting and keeps you engaged. I actually looked foward to going to this class every other morning.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	5	460938	10/23/06	OMG I love this man. Not only does he really know what hes talking about, but he will not stop trying to find a way to explain it to you so that you understand. He's really easy to talk to and I trusted his advise more than my academic advisor. YOu could talk to this man about anything. He gets everyone involved in fun ways. Simulations!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	1	5	4	5	460938	7/25/06	the HARDEST professor i have ever had at SUNY Albany, that being said, great guy, always available, easy to talk to, and gets everyone involved, just do the work and you will have fun
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science		3	5	5	4	460938	6/8/06	Real friendly down to earth guy, if you get to know him. Talk to him, he'll help you out, but your gonna have a decent load of work.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	2	3	3	3	460938	5/12/06	m
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	5	460938	4/20/06	maybe you shouldnt be in college if you cant handle the work
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	2	2	2	4	460938	4/1/06	Far too difficult for an intro level class. Hard to understand the material, and towards the middle you feel lost. Useful for credits, but don't expect an A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	3	5	460938	3/23/06	I loved poli sci before his class but he kinda turned me off from it, even though I still wanna major in it. The one thing that sucks is its pos102!!!! he teaches it like its a grad course, theres a crap load of reading and the quizzes are hard and so is everything...the midterm wasnt bad ill admit, which is good.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	450	3	5	5	5	460938	11/14/05	Prof Asal teaches this fantastic, seminar format, class on research methods. Prof Asal is one of UAlbany's finest - and it shows in this class. You are guaranteed to be stimulated intellectually in this class. Expect a mutually respectful and rewarding relationship with Prof Asal.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	566	2	5	4	3	460938	11/11/05	Great class! Asal is one of the only professors @ SUNY that has a genuine intrest in your success forllowing graduation, actually he may be the only professor. Very helpful, you just need to ask.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	566	3	5	5	5	460938	10/20/05	Great teacher, there to help the student
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	2	1	1	3	460938	9/20/05	Very unprepared lecturer. Do not take his class unless you want to learn all of the material on your own. He's a nice guy, but completely turned me off of Poli. Sci. Get out of his class asap!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	1	1	1	2	460938	6/12/06	blah
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	1	1	1	3	460938	5/16/06	BLAH!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	5	460938	4/20/06	Probably the best Professor at UAlbany, he can take an 8:45 class and make you want to participate and be completely involved in the subject. By far a great Professor to take a class with
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	5	5	5	460938	4/20/06	Best poli sci class I have taken at albany so far..interesting material..always makes himself available to help..makes class fun with his simulations...if you do the work, you do well..don't expect an easy A
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	2	1	1	3	460938	4/1/06	just was not that good of a class and didnt make it interesting for me.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	450	1	1	1	2	460938	12/6/05	very smart but doesnt translate well to the class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	450	2	5	3	4	460938	11/13/05	Any student serious in Poli Sci must take this class. Learn how to actually research a topic/issue. He expects a lot, which is a far cry from almost all other professors. Youll think he is expecting too much at first, but realize that this will help you out greatly.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	450	3	5	5	5	460938	10/25/05	This class is an absolute must if you are a poli sci major. Teaches research methods in comparative politics. Requirements included the reading of two studies, several research articles, and a 20 page research paper due at the end of the semester that is written with other students. Highly recommended - challenging, but worthwhile.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	2	4	3	1	460938	9/22/05	Ugh... don't take this class unless you are good with politics, history, etc. I took it, and I got decimated. 59 on my first paper. =( I had to drop the class. 1 W isnt too bad... right?
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	5	1	1	1	460938	8/31/05	take this class with Tom Walker.... it will be worth your time! otherwise, you are just flushing tuition down the drain.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science		2	5	5	4	460938	7/13/05	took an independent study with this professor, greatest guy ever. i took several of his classes and yeah, there was a lot of reading and quizzes, but if you are interested in the broader scope of what your talking about, youll do fine. speak your mind, youll do better if he sees that your interested in class and can tell if your making it up.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	0	Political Science	102	1	3	1	4	460938	4/16/05	Prof. Asal is a nice guy. But there is an insane amount of reading and writing for this class and his quizzes are really hard. He never reviews before a test or quiz. I would not recommend taking Comparative and International Politics with him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	3	3	3	5	460938	4/13/05	Use the TAs!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	1	4	2	5	460938	3/28/05	I can not believe the amount of reading for this 100 level course. Asal is very demanding. Requires four papers, the last one being a piece of original research. He assigns papers during midterm week - doesn't care that you have other classes. Just because he is nice doesn't mean its fair.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	399	4	5	5	4	460938	9/16/04	Just have to go to class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	3	5	5	5	460938	4/26/05	This class is one of the most intelligent gen eds offered. It blatantly states on the syllabus that IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THE WORK, don't take the class. He and the TA are some of the most delightful people I've worked with, and they're insanely helpful. Use them, that's what they're there for.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	102	1	5	2	3	460938	4/14/05	DO NOT TAKE CLASS VERY VERY DIFFICULT A LOT OF READING, PAPERS, QUIZES ARE NOT REVIEWED FOR PRIOR TO THEM, DO NOT TAKE COURSE, NICE PROFESSOR AND VERY HELPFUL BUT TOO DIFFICULT FOR 100 LEVEL
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	1	Political Science	102	1	5	1	3	460938	4/3/05	This class was awful. Seems like a nice guy, but his teaching style is not very good. The amount of reading for this class is rediculous. Quizzes count for 1/4 of your grade, and he doesn't even tell you what is on them (besdies a very general overview). DO NOT TAKE POS 102 WITH THIS MAN!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Victor Asal	4.1	2	Political Science	399	3	5	5	3	460938	10/31/04	If you don't take a course with this man, it's your own loss. He is fantastic, smart, and kind of cute.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	564	2	4	5	3	837479	6/27/10	During 12 mostly terrible U Albany education classes, this was my favorite professor. Enthusiastic, knew her stuff, and although she was PC she was not blindly PC and could discuss the aspects of PC thinking in this field that bothered me. (Unlike many U Albany education professors she's secure enough to politely debate after class.)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	564	3	3	4	4	837479	10/20/08	This professor ripped me apart when I asked for help.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	369	5	4	5	4	837479	12/12/06	I loved this class. I felt it was really really interesting to begin with, but she made it so much more interesting. She's really sweet and you can tell she's really into special education, really loves what she does. I felt the assignments were really easy, so were the tests, but I know not everyone did well. Take the class if you can.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	369	3	5	5	4	837479	10/26/06	Great teacher. She is very thorough in her notes, and is excited about teaching. Really helpful outside of class and answers emails fast. Tests are okay, but if you pay attention in class and do the readings, you'll do fine. Take a class with her if you can!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	0	Education	564	1	1	1	1	837479	2/14/09	I think this was the nost boring class. THis professor thinks she knows everything, when in reality, she should be the one getting lectured!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	369	4	5	5	5	837479	12/27/06	Great teacher. A rare combination of someone who knows the content, has worked in the field, AND knows how to teach. You will not find a more understanding, knowledgeable, dedicated instructor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Kristie Asaro	4.0	2	Education	369	4	5	4	4	837479	11/3/06	The class can be boring at times, but she is very sweet and helpful and knows what she is talking about. She is very easy to talk to :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	112	1	1	1	3	1024364	7/30/10	He tries very hard. But often it seems he's learning the material with us, which make it very difficult for him to answer questions. Often he'd start a problem and take the whole class working on it, till a student would notice an error and he would be unable to provide a correct solution. This happened at least once every week.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	2	Mathematics	106	2	5	4	3	1024364	3/3/09	Great teacher. Very very helpful anytime I emailed him. Definately would not have passed calc if i didn't have him as a teacher. He explains things better in office hours. Plus not to bad to look at!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	113	1	1	1	3	1024364	2/10/09	He'll try to help you...try
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	2	Mathematics	106	5	4	4	4	1024364	12/26/08	This class is easy. He is really nice and helps a lot. Attendance is not mandatory and he does not even check the homework. EASY A class!! Highly recommend
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	1	Mathematics	112	1	1	5	5	1024364	11/18/08	All I have to say is, the two posters previous to mine are bloody idiots.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	112	1	1	1	4	1024364	2/5/08	Says things like "I'm not very good at explaining things" or "I don't have to know this stuff you guys do" and "When you ask me questions you're putting me on the spot and i just don't know" Terrible teacher math is not even his major. Stay away from him or prepare to get a tutor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	2	Mathematics	106	3	4	4	2	1024364	8/30/07	He is the sexiest math teacher ever.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	112	1	3	1	2	1024364	9/2/09	Terrible. Instead of showing us problems or doing practice problems he kept giving us very lengthy proofs. Would waste whole class periods on these proofs. Then he would give us insanely long/hard exams and be surprised when many people failed.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	113	1	2	1	5	1024364	2/12/09	omg... you won't want him unless you want yourself get really confused about all the stuff. i was really interested in calculus, but not anymore.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	2	Mathematics	112	5	5	4	4	1024364	1/27/09	Very good teacher, yeah he stumbled sometimes but if you do the homework assigned and pay attention in class you'll do well. If you have any questions just go to his office hours and he'll spend the time to explain to you how to do things. Really good teacher in my honest opinion and would definitely take a class with him again!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	113	1	1	1	3	1024364	12/12/08	He tries
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	0	Mathematics	113	1	2	2	4	1024364	10/24/08	This was his first semester teaching calc II and if it weren't for people in the class correcting him, everything he put on the board would always be wrong. The person below me quoted him perfectly. As a person who has gotten A's in all my other math courses I am struggling through his course.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Benjamin Atchison	2.6	2	Mathematics	106	4	5	4	1	1024364	12/17/07	He is sooo nice. Calc can be hard but just do the homeworks (not graded) and go to him with any questions. He's always willing to give extra help and if you go to his review sessions he'll tell you what's on the quizzes/tests. Best math teacher at Albany.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Erin Aubeuf	4.2	2	Art	105	2	5	4	3	1380315	1/16/10	While she is still a student, she had a good command over the subject and still made the class enjoyable.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Amy Aucompaugh	5.0	2	Psychology	420	4	5	5	3	773481	5/8/06	One of the best teacher I ever had. She's understanding and very clear on what she expects from you.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Amy Aucompaugh	5.0	2	Psychology	420	4	5	5	5	773481	12/7/05	Honestly, the best class I've ever taken at this school. She makes the information alot of fun to learn. If you get a chance to take her class definately do it! There is alot of information on her tests to know but it's all pretty easy stuff
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	2	Economics	370	3	5	4	3	1218910	2/25/12	If you go to class and pay attention and take notes you will ace it easily. She goes over key concepts multiple times and the questions on the test are very similar to the examples she gives in class. She fully explains everything you need to know and will happily answer any question you have.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	355	1	1	1	1	1218910	12/25/11	any good comments written was probably written by herself. She is NOT cute, so if you see that in the comment, its a load of bull and she def wrote it herself.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	355	1	1	1	1	1218910	5/16/11	Warning you, she is the worst economics teacher in the department. She was absent for 6 days before the final and expected us to know 5 chapters after teaching for mayb 3 days. Never prepared for class too.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	355	1	1	1	1	1218910	4/12/11	Expected comments here to be somewhat true. However, you may want to not take her class bc she is not helpful at all. You need to study textbook by yourself and it still doesn't guarantee your grade. All in all, just don't take it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	2	Economics	351	5	5	5	5	1218910	10/27/10	Her class is the easiest class I've ever taken, but for those whose major is economics, it's kindda boring class(Because she cares that everyone is on the same page, different from math teachers. If you really want to be a competitive economist or financial analyst, read extra appendix section she offers and ask her many questions.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	1	Economics	101	2	4	2	4	1218910	1/21/09	Microeconomics was easy enough. She was a bit hard to understand and didn't answer questions well in class, but she was available outside of class and the tests were fairly easy. Got an A in the class with moderate effort.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	355	1	1	1	1	1218910	12/29/11	sux. any good comment on here was probably written by herself. I went to every class and she was unprepared almost all the time. she skipped about 8 lectures...like 1/3 our semester. U think that may be cool, but...u wont be happy when u fail the exam and in the end u realize uve learned nothing.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	2	Economics	370	4	5	4	3	1218910	12/15/11	Great professor, had her for Economics of Labor. Attendance is not mandatory but you should got to class to get the notes since there are no slides. Plus, she is really cute, so its a plus going to class. She explains the material very well. A little disorganized sometimes, but not terrible. I recommend taking a class with her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	355	1	1	1	1	1218910	5/16/11	Had her for public finance. She was absent like 6 times nd expected us to know 5 chapters for the final after teaching for mayb 3 days. She thinks jus cuz she flips over a slide nd reads wat is on it she went over it. She really does not know anything about the subject and was unprepared every class. She cant really answer ur questions eaither.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics		1	1	1	1	1218910	4/7/11	Her public finance class was terrible. She knows nothing about public finance whatsoever..Have fun taking a class with a TA that has never probably worked for any major financial firm. TERRIBLE!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	2	Economics	355	2	5	3	2	1218910	5/9/09	Very sweet, class was very hard but she was always willing to give extra help. Literally retaught a lesson to me the day before finals. If you go to her office hours, she will go out of her way to make sure you understand the material.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Bilge Avci	2.3	0	Economics	111	3	1	1	2	1218910	12/30/08	not clear at all, tests are very confusing with unfair grading, takes FOREVER to give back grades, STAY AWAY!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Isabel Ayala	3.8	2	Latin American Studies	100	5	5	5	1	1081700	9/23/08	She is the best teacher!!! It's amazing her class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Isabel Ayala	3.8	2	Latin American Studies	201	3	5	4	4	1081700	2/16/08	I found her lectures informative and concise. She is clear with her thoughts and helpful in and out of the class. Likes to use big words even when she doesn't pronounce them correctly. GO TO REVIEW WITH TA! tough grader, counts participation in a lecture with 100 kids at 9:20 AM 3 times a week. when she says she remembers faces, she's not kidding
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Isabel Ayala	3.8	1	Latin American Studies	201	3	3	2	2	1081700	2/3/08	I am not fascinated by her class but she is one of the most appealing teachers I have ever had. Her accent is so damn sexy!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Isabel Ayala	3.8	2	Latin American Studies	201	2	4	4	3	1081700	4/9/08	Her bark is louder than her bark. Have to take notes, words the tests funny(3tests), but corrected that after people did bad on the first test. Group activities are part of 20% for participation, which you need to be in class for. After reading the other comments I was scared, but its not that bad!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Isabel Ayala	3.8	1	Latin American Studies	201	3	4	2	2	1081700	2/14/08	She doesn't know how to teach, but she has a great ass.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Karolina Babic	4.2	2	Latin American Studies	315	3	5	5	4	1497854	11/13/11	What a great professor! I took her fully online course,Film in Contemporary Latin America. She assigns a film in the beginning of every week. You have to watch the film, create a discussion thread before Weds and answer the assigned questions about the film by Sunday afternoon. I love this class so much that I'm going to minor in LA studies!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Karolina Babic	4.2	2	Latin American Studies	315	4	4	4	2	1497854	11/18/10	Class is not so bad, you get to watch a movie for every class. She expects you to write four 3 page film reviews and one 5 page film review throughout the course. Gives a few opportunities for extra credit. There is no midterm and no final. Overall, Class isn't that hard.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Karolina Babic	4.2	2	Latin American Studies	315	3	3	4	2	1497854	4/13/11	She def needs to shorten her lectures, because she just repeats herself too much. She also assigns a good amount of homework, but its not impossible just annoying. A lot of the kids called her "babble" instead of "Babic", but the nickname wasnt undeserved. Her movie choices were good. When writing the response papers, write as much as possible!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeffrey  Baez	1.5	0	Information Science	201	4	1	2	4	1787756	12/28/12	As someone who has TA'd for numerous classes in the INF department I must say this was the most disorganized class I have ever been enrolled in. The professor grades everything really late, provides no feedback, and does not follow the syllabus at all. Going to class was received 98 points ended up with a B-, my friend received 60 points, B-.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	210	3	5	4	5	368737	10/24/12	Really good teacher. Explains things well and if you need help with anything he is always there to help and make sure you know how to do it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	214	5	4	5	4	368737	1/21/06	Ryan is one of the best math professors I have ever had. Most of his tests are really easy, and he gives ridiculus amounts of partial credit! He's really friendly, easy to talk to, and explains everything clearly. If you have a question he'll go over the material voer and over again until the class understands!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	368737	11/25/05	Ryan is awesome teacher. He makes Calc 3 easy to learn. He takes it slow and will answer any questions you ask. His projects aren't terrible, but they do require some work, but its a group effort. If you have to take Calculus, take it with Ryan.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	214	3	5	5	5	368737	10/9/05	Excellent teacher. I had him a couple years ago, but taking his class really encouraged me to study mathematics further. Everyone who takes his class will benefit from his clarity
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	214	4	5	5	5	368737	8/9/05	Cool guy, good teacher. Explained stuff well, and kept it slow. He generally avoided giving low grades, and if he had to, he found ways for you to make up for it. Plus, he is the one of the few teachers I've had for a low-level course who speaks ENGLISH!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	368737	2/2/05	Great teacher, good guy. Easy A... Expert at U-Sub.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	1	Mathematics	214	5	3	2		368737	9/7/04	very easy test.. i really didn't know what i was doing but i got an A easy A class... but didn't learn anything
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	368737	11/29/08	He knows even the equilvalent level public exams in England!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	214	3	4	4	3	368737	1/17/06	I think he's a realllly cool and fun guy. He definitely curves a little. I should not argue about that at all, but there were many tests where the whole class average should have been very low...and thats gotta tell ya something about his teaching. So I liked him a lot, but he's gotta change a few things about his teaching
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	368737	10/23/05	great teacher, very helpful, highly recommended

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	112	4	5	5	4	368737	4/14/05	This class would have been a lot harder had I not taken AP calc in H.S. He really gives you a chance to do well. He also wants to see your effort. Use the office hours. I didn't do good on every test but still got an A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Ryan Bakes	4.6	2	Mathematics	112	3	4	4	4	368737	1/24/05	Good teacher. Study and attend class, tests are fair. Usually avaialable for help.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Marie Balfour	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	210	4	4	5	4	767486	11/30/05	She was my TA and was pretty good. Learned more from her than the professor! Just do the readings, I was the only one who did and she loved me for it, giving me an A in the class even though I figured I couldn't possibly have gotten all the points necessary for that grade!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Tricia Barbagallo	4.0	2	History	100	3	5	3	4	1306300	7/27/09	This is a warning for everyone thinking of taking this class- go to class every day and don't be late. Your grade will be considerably better. She grades on a generous curve and is very helpful if you just ask for help. Understand a couple of concepts very well for each test because she gaves a lot of choices for the essays. Happy Studying! :)
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	1	1	4	1123978	5/16/11	I should have listened to the reviews on this website. Absolute worst professor at UAlbany. He focuses more on evolutionary psy than child psy, and prefers testing you on his opnion as opposed to the coursework. He does not notify the class when he will not show up, and shows no interest in the material. Absolutely awful.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	2	1	1	1123978	12/9/10	He is an awful awful teacher, I would never recommend this teacher to anyone. His tests are ridiculous and he doesnt give any study guides. He should have been fired.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	1	1	4	1123978	12/3/10	I am not sure why this man teaches Child Dev., because he has not taught me anything outside of the realm of evolutionary psy. He skips things he doesn't agree w/ and his exams are the worst I've ever taken in organization and cohesiveness (he's included opinion questions). I wouldn't recommend taking this class to anyone who cares about their GPA.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	2	2	2	3	1123978	10/28/10	This is the worst Professor I've ever had. I have never commented on this site before, but i felt the need to for this professor. DO NOT TAKE this course, he doesn't explain anything and the tests are extremely difficult.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	1	Psychology	203	1	4	1	1	1123978	10/3/10	There seems to be no point in coming to class, he speeds through the slides that he explains are ONLINE, doesn't really explain them well, I think its bad.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	2	1	2	1123978	5/4/11	He's a horrible teacher. His tests do not match the material, whatsoever. He teaches based on his opinion and not by the textbook. I have gone to every class and studied two weeks before his exams but it doesn't matter because the tests are not based on what you learn.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	1	1	1	1123978	12/4/10	Quickly reads over slides in class with no time to take notes. Extremely difficult exams. My GPA would be a 4.0 without this class. Now it will probably be a 2.5. AVOID this man
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	211	1	1	1	1	1123978	11/2/10	The class average for the first test was a 50 and he barely curves. He is the worst teacher I have ever had. Do not take his class. He should not be teaching.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	203	1	2	1	1	1123978	10/20/10	I go to class but I do work for another class while in it.. He is not a good prof and gives tests that are so hard he doesnt give out study guides or anything he expects you to know things when he hasn't even took the time to teach them
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jeremy Atkinson	1.5	0	Psychology	210	2	2	1	1	1123978	4/18/08	he goes too quickly and explains things in a really complicated way. i had to teach myself through the textbook. he is available through extra help and gives extra credit so he's not absolutely terrible. but he needs to fix up his teaching style. no one ever understands him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jessica  Aubin	2.0	0	Political Science	101	1	1	2	5	1769382	12/30/12	You should avoid her as a TA. She is an extremely harsh grader and no provides no basis for the grades she assigns. She is of little help when approached and does not care at all how students do in her discussion class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Jessica  Aubin	2.0	1	Political Science	101	2	2	3	5	1769382	11/19/12	Harsh grader, went to her office hours twice and she wasn't even there. Very snotty and seemingly impossible to please.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sandra Austin	2.9	0	Social Work	630	3	2	2	3	171007	11/15/10	Wouldn't recommend or retake. Thought I'd learn a lot in this class, haven't. Teaching style is off putting, kinda wacky but dull. 1st half reads & gives notes direct from text. 2nd half dull group activity discussing scenarios then share. Monotonous. Can barely tell 1 topic from the next. This week she lost all our papers- now resubmit or get a 0.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sandra Austin	2.9	2	Social Work		2	5	5		171007	11/9/03	Excellent Macro prof. Very well prepared for class. Many years of field experience. I'd take anything she taught.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Sandra Austin	2.9	1	Social Work	792	3	3	3	3	171007	12/15/06	She is nice but the class was not that great. She is quite vague on the paper assignments and does not give much direction. This course should definitely be year-long because there is too much information to learn in such a short time-period. Overall, I thought the class could have provided more insight if taught a little different.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Avitable	2.1	1	Computer Science	201	1	2	3		104543	5/27/03	I had to take this class for my major. I was so glad when the class was over and I got a C, worst class I ever took!

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Avitable	2.1	0	Computer Science	201	2	1	1		104543	3/5/03	horrible, can't follow, most of the learning was from the Teaching Assistants, was way ahead in class of what you did in homework and tests, so work didn't follow the material, just horrible
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	John Avitable	2.1	2	Computer Science	201	3	5	5		104543	2/7/03	Might be leaving. Does well with difficult material.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Suho Bae	4.0	2	Economics	705	3	5	3	3	886870	6/9/08	VERY SWEET MAN! Though, he can be some what dry . get that coffee in prior to class. He is very helpful and good one on one. He really wants you to succeed. Make sure you get your research topic set early on. something you know well and what may seem to be a very easy research Q. you'll regret picking something hard. STUDY GROUP FOR final!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Suho Bae	4.0	2	Economics	110	4	4	3	4	886870	11/27/06	Great professor. Language barrier was sometimes an issue(Korean accent) but he's a funny guy. Do the 5 homeworks. He learns your name if you show up so that might help with grades but attendence is not mandatory, just read the book and you will do fine. Also if a class is canceled b/c of him he will reschedual outside of normal class time.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Suho Bae	4.0	2	Economics	300	4	5	4	4	886870	4/28/07	very good professor. he tries his best to teach u the material and does his best to make the difficult stuff as easy as possible. i would highly recommend taking him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	3	5	9518	3/13/13	Wonderful teacher! She does not so much give notes as she loves to discuss ideas. Her readings are awesome and you will leave her class with a very new way to look at the world. She prepares you for your own research by entertaining any and all questions. You will do well by coming to class and caring about the materials.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	1	Criminal Justice	310	3	3	2	3	9518	10/26/07	The class is pretty boring and her notes are pretty scattered as she draws hundreds of web diagrams on the board, and tries to connect ideas. I wouldn't recommend this class or the professor.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	404	3	4	4	5	9518	1/5/07	Heavy use of videos. Readings are mostly for the test. Not much discussion.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	1	Criminal Justice	210	4	2	3	4	9518	10/30/05	She may be brilliant, but is not suited for teaching. You could skip every lecture and still pass because the T.A. told you what you needed to know in the discussion. She's not bad, and neither is the class, so taking this class is worthwhile.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	404	3	5	2	5	9518	1/17/05	decent course
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	404	2	3	4	4	9518	12/7/04	I wasn't too fond of her method of note taking (writing one word on the board then speaking fast) You don't know what to study for, the mid term was way to specific and has dreaded T/F questions. She is a nice lady though, available in office hours often.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	0	Criminal Justice		5	3	1	2	9518	11/26/04	Nice lady but useless professor. Should stick to writing mystery novels.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	604	4	4	4	5	9518	12/5/11	Dr. Bailey is brilliant. She is perhaps not the best instructor, but she has a million ideas and is fascinating to listen to. The videos she showed in class were excellent and she did a fantastic job linking the past to the present, and vice versa. I highly recommend taking at least one class of hers.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	1	Criminal Justice	310	3	2	3	3	9518	3/12/07	I don't really understand the point of the class. It's called "policies of crime in a hetergenous society" but i don't recall actually talking about crime policies.. we talk about crime, just no policies.. unless i missed something.. otherwise, fairly easy, pretty boring, shouldnt be a 3 hour class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	210	4	4	4	4	9518	4/1/06	Great class, great teacher!

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	0	Criminal Justice	404	3	1	1	5	9518	12/12/04	Teacher was incredibly unclear, often at times rambling and giving circular lectures. Overall topic is interesting but the teachers inability to convey understanding makes this course horrible for anyone interested in learning about criminal justice.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	0	Criminal Justice		3	2	1	4	9518	12/1/04	She may be a nice person but definetly a horrible lecturer. She actually said she didn't know what th LA riots had to do with crime. Can't believe I'm in this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Frankie Bailey	3.2	1	Criminal Justice		4	3	2		9518	3/10/04	Nice person, lousy professor, boring class. You won't learn much from this class except the latest propagana on race and crime.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rebekah Bale	5.0	2	English	144	5	5	5	2	1136004	12/22/10	She makes her class really enjoyable. At first I was not sure if I would enjoy the class but she made it easy to want to come to class. Attendance is mandatory expcept for four "sick days" without a note. Great Teacher and pretty easy class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rebekah Bale	5.0	2	English	346	4	5	5	3	1136004	5/12/08	Really nice and a fair grader, I'd definitely recommend taking a class with her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Rebekah Bale	5.0	2	English		5	5	5	5	1136004	4/28/09	Took her for Shakespeare's History plays. She's awesome, really nice and fair and easy, but you definitely learn something. She makes you think too. Big on small group work. Again, SUCH an easy class. She probably won't be teaching for awhile, I think she's going on leave, but if you ever can, take her.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	1	African-American Studies	219	3	3	3	3	471703	1/31/13	Overall he was a nice guy and was passionate for what he taught, he really knows what he was talking about. Midterm doesn't affect your final grade, but he doesn't tell you what will be on the exams. If you're looking for an easy A I'm not sure this is the right class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	0	African-American Studies	219	2	1	1	4	471703	1/3/13	Stay Away! This class has completely no structure. Prof. Ballard is really rude and does not follow the syllabus at all. His lectures consisted of him rambling about different individuals that never really tied in together. I only passed his class with a B, because of prior knowledge of the subject
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	0	African-American Studies	390	2	1	1	3	471703	12/21/12	Worst Professor I have had at Albany. Changes required books after you buy them. Makes a history course into an English course (had to read books on how to properly write). Rude to students and incredibly demeaning when students ask questions. Changes dates on syllabus completely along with class requirements. Stay Away
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	200	4	5	5	5	471703	11/7/11	hands down one of my favorite and most memorable professors of my college experience, he knows what hes talking about and if you plan on challenging him make sure your two steps ahead because if not hell push you 5 steps back, intro to african american history I def learned alot, really a good professor
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	3	5	4	2	471703	12/10/08	I absolutely love him! He is such a good professor. all you have to do is take notes and go to class and you will be fine. Even if you mess up on the midterm he will drop it if you do better on the final. Its a little bit of studying but what class isnt. He is always available outside of class and easy to talk to. Def take his class!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	0	African-American Studies	219	1	1	1	1	471703	2/21/08	class is ok, he knows the stuff, but very rude when it comes to interacting with students. get there right on time if you don't want the whole class to stare at you because he just kicked you out!!!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies		3	5	5	4	471703	1/11/08	One of the most interesting profs I took a class with- in both undergrad and grad school. Don't miss a class with him if history is your thing.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies		2	5	5	5	471703	3/9/07	I graduated in 96, and he is one of the best professors I haver had! It's because of him that I chose this as one of my majors, and I'm glad to see that he's still affecting our youth!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies		3	5	5	5	471703	9/1/05	dr. ballard is a great teacher, he is the reason why i never got kicked out when i should have

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	5	4	4	471703	1/8/13	LOVED THIS PROFESSOR. He comes across as intimidating but this mad just expects the best from you. He is a graduate of Harvard and has worked hard for his position and expects you to work for your grades..I left his class with a B..do your best and you will succeed in this class TRUST ME don't try to get the easy way out..wont happen
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	390	4	4	4	4	471703	1/3/13	Prof. Ballard is a sweet old man. This course has no structure, he changes it as it goes. While it was frustrating that kept changing dates and books around, listening to him lecture was awesome. He shows many films and documentaries. He emphasizes good writing skills and a large part of the grade is a final 10 pg term paper.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	1	African-American Studies	219	1	3	2	1	471703	8/27/12	It was a difficult class.Don't go there if you're there to pass an easy gen ed.This professor challenges you.lot of discussion . Not an easy class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	5	5	1	471703	4/2/10	Ballard is the man. His class requires that you put in the work. Alough you can skip class it is not recommended. He is dedicated to his subject and will give you all the knowledge you need to pass his test. His midterm is brutal but if you work hard for the final you are guaranteed a A.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	3	4	5	471703	5/5/08	He is brilliant and worth talking to outside of the classroom. Yes, he is set in his opinions, but who isn't, when you get down to it? I remember some interesting debates in his class about rap music, etc. (Gospel, esp. Mahalia Jackson, is his thing). He also taught Russian. One of my top three teachers in SUNY. And I had some greats.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	1	African-American Studies	219	4	2	4	2	471703	2/21/08	This prof is ridiculous. He does not tolerate lateness but who does he think he is to kick students out of class? bad bad temper. I thought professors should enhance students to learn, not prevent them from getting the most out of a class when they just could not get there in time for once.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	5	5	5	3	471703	4/15/07	VERY EASY, u can fail the midterm but pass the class with an A.only 2 exams. and two papers ridiculously easy. very interesting. doesn't tolerate lateness.

University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	5	5	5	471703	8/23/05	Ballard is the best. He is very old but very smart. He is easy to get along with and leaarn from. He has so much to offer the student if you talk to him outside of class. He is a very sweet man and all you have to do is show up. The music and reading from teh NY Times is great! I loved him
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	5	5	5	5	471703	3/7/05	Excellent professor
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	4	5	5	471703	1/3/05	Dont listen to the haters of Ballard He is the MAn.. Yes he does play music but its only to give you another aspect of the history.. who wouldnt love it.... HE gives 2 papers and one final and 10 easy extracredit points for the final.. If yo do the work you get an A. Although theres some reading be
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	0	African-American Studies	219	1	1	1	4	471703	12/7/04	Don't bother taking this class if you want to learn anything from the instructor. You basically buy the books & teach yourself. You come to class to listen to gospel music & be read to from the NY Times & then he crucifies you on the exams. He needs to retire or actually start imparting knowledge.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	490	4	4	5	5	471703	10/13/04	Entertaining curmudgeon. A little conservative, but understanding of other students' viewpoints. Also an astonishingly easy grader.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	101	3	5	4	4	471703	8/2/05	Dr. ballard is the BEST!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	4	5	4	5	471703	1/19/05	excellent professor, he is helpful when your able to catch him for a one on one meeting..he gives every student a chance to pass his class by dropping the lowest exam grade(out of 2 exams HELLO!!)..I like the gosple music at the 9am class it was soothing..
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	219	3	5	5	5	471703	12/31/04	The best professor ever. Challenging and makes you think more critically. Everyone should take one of his classes before graduating. Sad to read that others don't realize how lucky they are to have been in one of Dr. B's classes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Allen Ballard	3.9	2	African-American Studies	490	3	5	4	5	471703	11/26/04	very interesting and funny. Dr ballard makes you think and is open to all viewpoints
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	0	Russian	280	1	2	2	1	489235	8/28/12	definately not an easy class. Don't go if you are for gen ed.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	162	5	4	5	5	489235	10/1/09	One of the best professors I have had at Albany, very interesting professor, especially if you are a Russian major. I also have him for 311Y and it is by far my favorite class this semester!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	0	Russian	162	1	1	1	3	489235	11/25/08	Worst professor and worst class ever. Definitely do not take this class. Way too much work and you learn absolutely nothing in class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	380	4	5	5	5	489235	9/13/06	Great teacher, Great class
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian		5	5	5	5	489235	4/14/06	EASY Writing Intensive! i had problems this year & he let me make up 2 essays due over a month ago! if u like movies & intreasted in Russia over the past 100 yrs u'll like this class everythings online He's a generous grader. i learned a lot. 2 4page essays+ 2tests for RUS180. For 180Z u have those 2 essays and tests and 2 more essays that are 7pgs
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian		4	5	5	5	489235	12/25/04	Baran is great. If he taught more classes I needed, I'd take them, but I gotta stay in my major to graduate on time. I took a War in Euro Lit/Film class with him, definitely one of my favorite classes. take a class with him if you can
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian		2	4	4	4	489235	12/15/04	HE IS INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGEABLE and effective - and so you'd better listen more than talk because he is too smart to ****.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	162	5	5	5	4	489235	12/3/09	I took Russian Today. There is a lot of information to take in. So if you are only taking this for a Gen Ed requirement you might find it to be a lot of work. I personally found the subject very interesting. Professor Baran is an extremely knowledgable professor. Great lecturer. I will say a lot of work, but it is easy. 2 short papers, 1 term paper
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	380	3	5	5	4	489235	5/19/09	A very good, understanding, helpful and passionate professor. Lectures are very informative and interesting. Grading consists of 2 papers 30% each, a final exam that's 30%, and class participation that's 10%.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	0	Russian	162	2	2	2	1	489235	4/8/08	I thought baran was terrible. I did not learn anything in class and the readings were sometimes difficult. He only gave the writing intensive work a few weeks before the end of the semester, because he was so disorganized. I also thought he expected a lot.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian		3	5	3	5	489235	7/14/06	Dr.Baran is such a sweet man! He is a bit forgetful sometimes, but he is always willing to help. I am very lucky to have had him as an undergrad. and grad. school professor. He is very fair, and will give his time and help whenever you need it.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	0	Russian		1	1	1	1	489235	12/28/05	UGH!!! What can be said about this man... he is disorganized, always late, and patronizes women. He is very judgemental. Watch out.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	280	4	3	4	3	489235	12/23/04	Lots of reading for a cinema class, but fairly easy. Movies were pretty interesting. Tests weren't too hard. Fair but slow grader, didn't respond to emails.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Henryk Baran	3.6	2	Russian	280	4	4	4	4	489235	12/10/04	Very nice guy, interesting class.
