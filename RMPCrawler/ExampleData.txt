University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	1	History	000	4	3	4	225081	1/13/13	I've taken multiple classes with Professor Mazon. I think she's a fair grader and her teaching style is not facts/dates, rather the big idea. She takes getting use to, but is a kind lady and enjoyable to talk one on one with.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	388	4	3	3	225081	5/15/12	I've taken more than one class with her. If you get one her good side you'll be golden. She hates when people ask questions. She does get frazzled (a lot) but she is very knowledgeable . If you can get past how often she says "um..well...uh" you will be just fine. Her grading is pretty easy too
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	3	1	3	225081	11/5/10	Worst teacher I've ever had. She has no public speaking skills. Doesn't use powerpoint. She gets confused when ever you ask her a question. She says umm in every sentence. She makes you read terrible books and write essays about them with unfair grading policies. Only one test which was at the end consisting of 25 multiple choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	2	1	4	225081	1/20/10	She is literally the most boring prof I have ever had. Questions disturb her already incomprehensible flow and we must break for 5 minutes every time one is asked -including what was the last line since her handwriting and level of paper wasting is ridiculous. Take a different section of world civ. 2 if you can!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	340	4	2	3	225081	4/30/09	Avoid this professor at all costs. To tell the truth, if you're a good student, and you can write well, it will be easy to do well in this class- but you will learn little. You'd learn more from Wikipedia than from lecture. Assigned texts were only tangentially related to history. Grading policies are bizarre. Lectures are simplistic.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	2	1	4	225081	4/17/09	The absolute worst teacher i have ever had. She cant speak well at all, and uses ummm and ahhhh like 400 times a class. She grades punctuation more than the content of the essay. Her test is very easy if you go to the classes, which is the hard part cause there so boring. Im a history major and i found this class awful. Teach somewhere else please.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	1	1	3	225081	3/23/09	Horrible Class. I took this class because I had a strong interest in the topic. I would have learned more if I would have gone to the Holocaust Museum in DC. Terrible lectures, unorganized, ill informed, changes mind frequently, wastes class time, inconsistent grading policy. Class is to large for the topic trying to be taught.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	1	History	299	3	2	4	225081	1/29/09	before i got to the class, i read the comments on Mazon, and they were all bad. after the first 2 classes i knew why. shes pretty frazzled, her notes are unorganized and thoroughly uninteresting. she says "uh" and "umm" no less than 200 times per class, meaning her lectures are slow going. on top of that, its a Jewish history class, not Holocaust..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	1	History	423	2	2	4	225081	4/20/08	Not the worst teacher I have ever had but certainly not the best. The book she had us read were pretty interesting but discussions could be very tidious. She is really strick on grammar and can be pretty unclear with what she wants from you when it comes to the final paper. She is not overly helpful during her office hours either.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	3	2	2	225081	2/11/08	She alright, I guess.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	348	3	1	5	225081	11/21/12	Worst teacher I've ever had, at any level of school, ever. Aside from the stuttering, mindless rabble that comes from her mouth when you ask a question, I learned more from the other STUDENTS than I learned from her. You've been warned.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	346	4	5	3	225081	4/18/11	I've taken practically all of Mazon's classes. People get annoyed because she sometimes gets frazzled and says "um," but that shouldn't matter. She's a really great teacher. She assigns interesting readings and gives you all the tools you need to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	5	1	1	225081	4/21/10	At first I thought Mazon would be nice until she covered for my TA who had to take exams. She asked a question and I answered her, but it probably wasn't the answer she was looking for, but I'm not sure because she didn't really tell me if it was wrong? Very confusing. I stopped going to lecture and just get the notes from my TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	5	1	3	225081	6/2/09	Its good to know that a prof with no redeeming qualities whatsoever can just go sue SUNY and get the tenure they didn't deserve in the first place.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	1	1	1	225081	4/30/09	NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS. Never take anything she teaches. She is the most unhelpful teacher ever. Her tests are impossible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	3	1	3	225081	3/28/09	This lady is insane. She is rude and aloof and obviously couldn't care less about her undergraduate classes. I feel bad for the graders for having to work with her. She cancels class all the time, but like 5 minutes before so everyone still shows up. Don't expect compassion from her either.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	2	1	3	225081	3/9/09	Her class is the worst class that I ever took. She does not know what she talks about in the lecture. She speaks something else and something else is on the exam. Just 19 multiple choice questions. Disgusting ..Never take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	4	1	1	225081	4/22/08	absolutely the worst teacher EVER. she says "um" way too much and has no idea what she wants to teach. no one shows up to lectures, they are pointless. i would never take her again and wouldn't suggest her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	4	1	1	225081	4/12/08	Terrible professor. Lectures were useless. It's unclear exactly what was being taught in the class. She treats her students as if she were teaching a high school class. Overall the class is very poorly structured. It was a waste of my life. I did not learn one thing. I wonder how this woman is still teaching this course. Tests are multiple choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	423	5	4	1	225081	1/2/07	Easy grader. A little dull. Difficult disussions because she tends to interupt students while speaking.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	1	History	299	3	2	5	225081	10/21/06	She claims to have class discussions about the books yet of the several she assigned, I think we had one discussion and that was not productive at all. The books are worth reading however. I thought she was an easy grader so I'm surprised at the negative comments. No lie, one of the questions on the final was "What year did WWII end?".
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History		3	1	5	225081	4/13/06	She is truly awful: a lousy teacher and a miserable person who has a knack for making everyone else around her just as miserable. I did well in her class, so this isn't a gripe about grades. She is really, really awful, by far my worst experience at UB. AVOID
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	1	History	299	4	2	5	225081	8/12/05	She is a little distant, but the books and films are really good, if you do the work you will do well, she is a fair grader, stop complaining about grammer, proof read your papers!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History		4	2	3	225081	5/20/05	Picture Jeneane Garafolo and you have Dr. Mazon. She even looks like the famous comedian. Big on feminist agenda, correct grammar, attendence, but on the whole not too bad. However, she's a very fair grader, and she's not crazy with her workload, (SEE: McDevitt) She's not exactly a people person. She wont bowl you over with warmth or kindness
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	346	3	5	5	225081	4/12/05	I feel sorry for her because she gets such a bad rap from all the class morons. She is a very good teacher - her lectures were informative, and she had a good sense of humor. No tests, just papers - which she can grade strictly if you can't write, but not TOO strict-I did well on all of them. Easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	346	1	5	5	225081	1/14/05	Very hard grader, but well worth the effort. The first professor who has really challenged me at UB. It's hard to get used to her strict grammar guidelines, but overall she is an excellent teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	346	2	1	4	225081	12/1/04	annoying as hell, 3/4ths of the people dont show up to class cuz its so goddamned boring
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	2	2		225081	8/24/04	She's a very difficult grader. She is also not very approachable and I feel like she is almost condescending when you go to her for help. I did not learn very much at all about the Holocaust and would not reccomend anything she teaches to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	255	4	1		225081	5/4/04	I thought Prof. Mazon was a poor teacher at best. The course material was often unrelated to the course theme and unimportant. However, I did find her to be an easy grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History		3	1		225081	4/14/04	I don't think I could have a worse experience with a professor, oh wait should there be a semi-colon there? My punctuation might be slightly off so give me another C+. Oh, when you get my name right, and I'll get yours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	5	1	5	225081	5/9/06	No lie, the worst teacher I've had to date. Considering the amount of work we were assigned in a week eg. reading a 400 page book, she put no work into her lectures. I learned nothing from this class. Lectures were a huge waste of time. On a positive note- most of the readings were pretty good, even if we had to rush through them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	112	3	1	2	225081	4/10/06	I HATE HER. She teaches a lecture-only 20% of the people show up. Her lectures are not related to her grading-since you have to read a book each week. You have 3 2-page papers that you have to write on your choice of books assigned & a final paper that includes some lecture material. She is uninteresting & boring. Her teaching style is horrible
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History		4	3	2	225081	5/21/05	Cool, aloof, and very distant. Feminazi, but a fair grader. Straight forward with what she expects from you and your papers. Workload is fair. Loves German history, and its during these lectures she's most alive, and almost funny.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	405	2	4	4	225081	4/3/05	not a bad teacher at all, ppl are just too lazy to do the actual work, cause when you do, you get good grades. she does correct alot of punctuation, but university students SHOULD know what a run-on sentance is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	2	History	301	1	4	5	225081	12/22/04	Professor Mazon is a difficult Professor, yes. If you are too used to being taught at a high school level, do not take her course. However, if you've moved beyond 11th grader status, you will enjoy her classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	346	2	1	5	225081	10/12/04	This woman is a complete space cadette. And when she wants to admit that shes an American and not downplay our history while looking frowning on anyone who is proud of being one, THEN maybe I'll take another of her classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	255	2	2		225081	7/2/04	#1-You will have to buy 6 books that add up to $200+. And youll have to read them all to take weekly tests. Prof. has potential if she got a good powerpoint and gave more hand-outs. Attendance sheet. A final paper which I didnt know what to do. I flunked.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History		3	1		225081	4/29/04	She was probably the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. The only reason anyone went to that class was to sign the attendence sheet, and then you wanted to stab yourself in the head repeatedly so you wouldn't have to listen to her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia Mazon	2.0	0	History	299	1	1		225081	3/27/04	Very difficult, teaches from a very narrow perspective and drops half letter grades if there are mistakes as minor as a misplaced comma. I didnt think the Holocaust could be this uninteresting.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	0	English	201	2	1	5	507206	5/7/06	he wasnt clear about how he wanted the papers written. for me, someone who took 2 AP english classes in HS and has perfect grammar, he was cruel and his obsessive nature really screwed me on points when he marked my papers. accused me of being ****, and had to be brought to the head of the dept to get my grade changed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	0	English	201	2	1	1	507206	12/11/05	he was a horrible teacher, no only did he cancel most of his classes when papers were due, but he was very unclear about all of his assignment, his OCD about the little things took away from the real point of the class, although he was knowledgeable in the topic that he chose, his teaching styles were horrific
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	2	English	201	3	5	3	507206	10/22/05	He is simply the best, better than all the rest. He is well spoken and he truly communicates his intelligence. The books he assigned are interesting and he always has a good attitude. He is a nice person and a great teacher. we <3 you dude, you rock!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	0	English	102	3	1	5	507206	8/30/05	really disappointed in his style. he took an english class and made it into a political paper class. called me a **** for expressing my feelings on terrorism after explicitly asking students to express their feelings on the definition of terrorism. went to him to discuss it, he didnt help me and threatened to fail me if i talked to dept head.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	2	English	101	4	5	2	507206	12/13/04	Class is not so bad. He is a good teacher and will help you when you need it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	0	English	201	1	1	1	507206	12/31/05	just save yourself the waste of time, don't take his class. i am warning you now.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	2	English	201	4	4	4	507206	10/30/05	Painfully awkward in class sometimes, but not a bad guy, cares about the students and wants you to do well. If you show interest and talk in class you should do well. He gives you plenty of opportunities to do well, revisions and stuff. Assignments can be confusing, but just go up to him, it really helps.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	0	English		2	1	5	507206	8/31/05	He's a jerk. Plain and simple. Told me that I "did not accurately portray the way a****victim should act" when I wrote that the victim fought back. Became indignant when students expressed differing opinions. Repeatedly ogled the girls. Like I said, he's a jerk.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Mcauley	2.6	2	English	101	3	5	3	507206	6/5/05	He is very boring in his class but will help you. He also goes out of his way to listen to suggestions and works with students. Mr. Mcauley is boring in 101 but stay tuned for his 201 class because he is great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	2	History	540	2	5	5	1257858	5/19/10	Theresa is an extremely caring, brilliant, and dedicated professor. The education you get in her class will extend beyond the class time and she genuinely cares about having the material be meaningful and relevant. She deserves much more respect and praise than she is getting here.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	1	History	112	3	3	5	1257858	4/26/10	She is nice but I had Marta she her grading was really hard and I don't think Theresa realized it. We watched a lot of films that I didn't learn much from. We learned a lot about Native Americans that didn't have anything to do with the curriculum. She is part NA so I understand that she is proud of her ethnicity but it wasn't necessary
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	1	History	112	3	3	1	1257858	2/23/10	Nice lady, annoying class. I feel like we haven't learned anything and am always wondering why we watch too many movies. She gives the TA's too much power, and it doesn't seem like she ever wants to teach. Says a lot of umm's and uhhhh's (about 150-200/class). Nice/smiley lady though!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	2	History	112	5	4	3	1257858	4/24/09	Nice and decent teacher. Lectures consist of powerpoints (which she posts online) or a film, usually quizzes with the latter. Your grade comes from 2 exams, short homework assignments, and three 3-page papers (plus an extra credit one). We were given study guides before the exams, so you'll know exactly what's on them. Take it if you have a choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	2	History	112	5	4	3	1257858	4/26/10	Easy Class. Teacher is nice. But, very subjective. The prof as well as TAs have an obviously biased interpretation of history, and will occasionally make unsubstantiated political statements. More importantly though grading is easy and based on 2 exams, 3 short papers, and video quizes in lecture. Recomended if you need to knock off ugc requirement
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	2	History	112	5	5	4	1257858	4/22/10	She is a really nice lady- one that I would hope my future neighbor might be someday. Class is painfully easy however it is sometimes difficult to go to because it is boring at times. Lynette is a pretty good TA and also grades really easy. If you are interested in Native Americans, I would take this class. Pretty much an easy A or A- if you try.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	1	History	112	3	3	1	1257858	2/16/10	lectures are usually pretty geared toward the ethnicity of the professor / ta's. you must read the book carefully, since class lecture notes are often unclear. she doesn't post lectures online anymore due to a conflict between one student and a ta during lecture, which makes it hard to follow. overall nice lady
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Theresa McCarthy	3.5	1	History	112	5	3	2	1257858	4/17/09	She is very nice and the class is easy. We watch movies all the time but have to complete film quizzes, so u have to pay attention, or we will have a regular lecture on PowerPoint. She is Native American so be AWARE she teaches the class around Native American people. Don't really learn anything. There is a midterm and a final. Kinda easy class.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Timothy McCorry	4.8	2	Social Science	101	4	4	2	1696952	4/20/12	Dr. McCorry is such a great professor!! he honestly makes the class really interesting and fun. DO NOT buy the book you wont need it just go to class and you will be fine. And just remember, the answer to everything is IT DEPENDS!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Timothy McCorry	4.8	2	Social Science	101	5	5	5	1696952	3/19/12	McCory is the man! The class is so much fun. He does curse like its no ones business. But you get used to it. His class is funny! His exams are probably the easiest thing you will take in your college career. If you debate with him or argue with him he will love you! He loves to be challenged.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Timothy McCorry	4.8	2	Social Science	101	5	5	5	1696952	4/11/12	BEST CLASS EVER! this class is like a comedy show in a lecture hall. While laughing your still learning. Dr. McCorry is a brilliant man. only 2 tests the whole semester. sit in the front you can hear better it will feel like a conversation. He swears alot. dont need to buy the textbook he didnt really use it. tells exactly what is on the test.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Timothy McCorry	4.8	2	Social Science	101	3	5	3	1696952	2/29/12	HE IS THE MAN! Every class is like going to stand up comedy, but you're learning at the same time. He always has a funny story to tell and he doesn't filter his language which makes him seem like he is our age. I actually WANT to go to his class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	318	3	4	4	225082	11/13/12	The work is not terribly difficult, although he does have (reasonable) high expectations. He is very clear about what he wants in papers and outlines the material in an easy to understand manner. I had a great experience with this class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	1	History	112	2	2	1	225082	1/15/11	only take him if you are really good at history and love it. went to every class and took notes and still did poorly. tests were difficult and it was easy to loose points. he chose 6 books for the course and they were all awful and very difficult to read. he didn't offer to help at all. i do not recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	2	3	2	225082	11/8/10	requires ALOT of reading, but tests are very easy if you go to class and take notes. A LOTTTTT of reading for a 100 level course but he really keeps it interesting. plus he calls people out for texting and sleeping it class so thats entertaining. I recommend if you dont mind reading
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	321	2	5	3	225082	8/30/10	smart and funny. passionate about the subject matter. do the work and you'll do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	321	2	5	3	225082	4/27/10	McDevitt is certainly smart and interesting, although he does get frustrated when students aren't prepared. If you do the work, attend class, and make even a minimal effort, a B should be easy and an A do-able. He's very funny & clearly loves his subject matter.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	412	5	5	4	225082	9/1/09	I took him for World Civ and Haitian Revoolution. Very funny, very fair, EXTREMELY intelligent, but without arrogance. I have read several "bad" comments on Prof. McD., but they are obviously from the very few that rubbed him the wrong way or were disrespectlful in class. Very cool to talk to, and understanding of emergency situations if legit.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	4	3	3	225082	4/24/09	He was very entertaining, lots of sarcasm (in a good way). However, he says "umm..." about once a sentence and that can get kind of irritating.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History	497	3	1	3	225082	1/28/08	Gives unclear or no guidelines for assignments, then asks confused when students fail to do precisely what he *actually* wanted. Far too high on himself and his ego. Often seemed relatively hostile in class, such that I often came away with the impression that I was being taught by the academic version of the stereotypical schoolyard bully.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	1	History	250	2	3	4	225082	4/11/07	I took McDevitt's History of Ireland class. The topic was interesting, but you definetly had to do the readings and go to every class. The papers were pretty easy, and the exams were easy if you read and sat through the lectures. He gets really mad if people don't participate, and he can be tough, but it was a pretty easy class overall.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	497	2	4	5	225082	2/9/11	The class I took, since it was a thesis seminar, is totally non-representative of what other lectures are like, but I would describe this professor as intelligent, witty, and interesting. Somewhat harsh at times, but in a good way (if you want to improve).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	2	4	1	225082	12/8/10	The class is alot of work for a gen. ed., but the professor is really down to earth. I had him for recitation, and as long as you come to class and take notes and do the reading, the tests are a breeze
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	3	4	4	225082	10/27/10	Attendance is mandatory! Also, for my term, he used 5 books (total cost $90) and we were required to read the whole book. Go to class, do the readings, and you'll do fine. If you don't your grade will suffer!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	403	3	5	3	225082	4/29/10	He is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and is very passionate about it. He is an easy grader if you do your work well. Work load can be over whelming at times but worth it, I really learned alot in his class compared to other professors in the history department (Mazon)and his sense of humor makes the class interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	1	5	4	225082	4/26/10	Ferociously intelligent with an excellent sense of humor. High academic standards and excellent taste in shoes. Freakishly tall, but very easy on the eyes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	1	History	112	2	2	1	225082	5/12/09	Better than other world civ professors but not recommended if other better teachers are there. Interesting lectures, but hard exams. Recitation is most of grade so go. if u dont like history, this won't help. if u do, then you'll probably do well. 2 exams, 2 essays, and a final. this year it was a take home essay.easier than the exams & papers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	5	4	3	225082	4/18/09	he's interesting to listen to and doesn't assign a ton of work, though he doesn't directly teach to the material on the test. read the book and be respectful while he's speaking, and he's fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	321	1	5	1	225082	4/6/08	One of the more interesting teachers I have had at UB. He grades papers with expectations you should be able to meet, do not write his papers the night before or the day of. If you follow, Argument, support, support, disprove, support, conclude, you'll be fine. All of his essays let you do this. If you bomb one test you can recover, I did.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History	112	1	1	1	225082	9/30/07	Prof. in dire need of anger management class. His anger comes out in the way he relates to students and the topics he speaks to us about. Even though he never picked on me, it was super annoying having to listen to him stop the lecture multiple times to tell students to wake up, stop talking etc. etc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	497	2	4	2	225082	12/16/06	First year teaching the honors thesis seminar, McDevitt did a pretty decent job in improving the writing skills of the class in general. However, some people still have no idea what historiography is (essentially the whole point of the class). Numerous short papers/oral reports, one 15-20 pager, and a final 20-25 page historiographic essay.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History		3	5	3	225082	7/11/06	Awesome guy, totally interested in what he's doing and tries to get you into it too. Brings in cool stuff like music, movies, books that relate to what you're learning. He's not totally easy on grading but pay attention in lectures, take good notes and study them and you're all set.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History		3	5	2	225082	2/7/06	I took him twice and liked him. very monty python/eddie izard in his lectures. he assigns alot of work, but its easy enough if you come to class and read. also -- after he lost weight and starting wearing better clothes, he was cute too!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History		2	4	5	225082	10/30/05	I believe Professor McDevitt is a challenging and excellent educator. If you find attending class and writing a few short essays extremly taxing, then don't bother taking his courses. However if you are enrolled in college to learn, and to earn your grades you will enjoy his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History	112	3	1	1	225082	7/22/05	TERRIBLE PROFESSOR! very arrogant and cocky
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	1	History	112	2	2	5	225082	6/11/05	Don't take him.He's very tough.I hate history and Dont care what he says about "history being applied to today." Absolutely worst UGC professor and I only passed because my T.A. and I knew each other from the previous semester.He's very smart and funny, but I find him to be very arrogant and he singles out sleepers in lecture. DO NOT TAKE HIM.SUCKS
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History		1	1	3	225082	5/21/05	Very condescending. BIG ego. Can be a real arrogant son of a ****. Big guy who thinks he can bully people. His work load is impossible. Stay away from this jerk unless you are a History major. I will admit he does know his matereial though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	249	2	4	3	225082	5/3/05	One of the tougher history professors. McDevitt gave us an overload of reading with 5+ books to buy and endless course-reserve documents. Exams are difficult, and his grading is nitpicky. Attendance is taken, and he doesn't give out notes, so be ready. Otherwise, he is pretty good.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History	2	1	2	3	225082	3/23/05	Laughed at my issues with the class in office hours. Not helpful at all. Encourages class participation. Every student answer is wrong to McDevitt no matter what. Not clear about assignments and contradicts himself all the time. Says "uhhhm" at least a couple hundred times during class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	250	3	4	4	225082	11/30/04	Great Class, Lectures you cant sleep through, Funny, in short i would highly reccommend this Prof...

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	421	2	4	3	225082	5/9/06	McDevitt is a tough professor when it comes to earning your grade, but he's fair. Participation is huge in his class, and it isn't a blow off grade like in most. He writes down everything you say and your grade suffers if you don't contribute. If you like staying home and missing class, don't sign up for McDevitt's courses. Work hard = doing well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	20	3	5	4	225082	2/7/06	I liked him & didn't find him arrogant or cocky. His sense of humor is pretty dry & therefor goes over the heads of the people who don't read or know anything whatsoever about history. He makes history relevant and fun and I never felt too bored in class, even though it was early in the morning.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	2	2	5	1	225082	10/26/05	McDevitt rocks! He's funny and helpful and he actually expects college students to behave like college students and work. Somehow asking students to read books earned him a rep as tough, which is BS. Some students were put off by the fact that he wasn't handing out A's like Halloween candy in a gen ed course. whatever. get a life.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History		1	1	3	225082	7/19/05	Typical rookie professor. Trying to make a name for himself by imposing impossible work loads on studendents. Has a very high opinion of himself. Not very helpful. Always puts onus back on you to figure things out. This guy was my departmental advisor, but he didn't know jack about departmental requirements, and he could care less. BIG EGO!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	0	History	249	1	2	5	225082	5/22/05	TOUGH! Apparently he's trying to increase his well deserved reputation as the most demanding History Professor at UB regarding workload. Impossible to get an A with this guy. A- only come with complete dedication. Prepare for a lot of library time
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	1	History		1	3	4	225082	5/20/05	He's demanding, egotistical, overbearing, and very liberal in his politics which he's not afraid to share with anyone who will listen, but he can be a good teacher. His work load is ridiculous, his grading is extremely tough, but he does make the classes lively. He's still a junior professor, but his ego is already super-sized. I wonder what he'
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History	112	5	5	1	225082	4/15/05	Hes a good teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History		2	5	5	225082	12/10/04	Had him at another school (Rowan Univ.) for 3 classes. Was disappointed when he left for NY! Demanding, but fair & helpful. GREAT sense of humor if you can keep up with him (allot of Simpson's references). VERY knowledgeable & not shy about letting you know it! Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick McDevitt	3.6	2	History		3	5	3	225082	11/1/04	Excellent Teacher! Presented material in an interesting and logical way. Was very helpful and approachable, despite the large size of the class.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	3	782957	4/25/11	Great professor for a pretty easy class. He puts incomplete notes online that you fill in during class. There are reading assignments but they aren't too important. The class is graded on a few papers and you get to drop the lowest on. The TAs do the grading on your papers so any questions really go to them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	5	4	1	782957	12/21/10	Easiest class i've ever taken. Never went to class. A total of 5 papers with the lowest one dropped. Just get the notes from someone online and you can easily write a B+ paper without much thought.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	3	4	4	782957	3/25/10	I took intro to Philosophy with him, and was very pleased with his ability. If you don't like Philosophy to begin with the material might annoy you, but he is fair and nonjudgmental in his discussions, and he has a great skill for understanding what confused students are stuttering about, somehow managing to include that in his lectures. 4/5 stars.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	328	3	5	3	782957	11/25/08	A challenging course, but McGlone is a fantastic teacher. He's very willing to help and provide feedback. It doesn't hurt that he's completely adorable and brilliant either!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	4	4	3	782957	2/1/08	First, McGlone is a total babe. In this class we had no exams, just essays. The essays were EXACTLY on the material presented in class. Just show up to class, pay attention, and write a couple good essays and you will get an A no problem

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	5	4	4	782957	4/14/11	McGlone is on medical leave as of mid April =( Take his class if he comes back. All you have to do is write a couple essays that you can find all the information on the notes he gives out. Easiest class I've taken. Pay attention and go to class, simple as that.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	328	3	4	4	782957	12/19/10	He is very enthusiastic professor. Go to class because he chooses really hard texts and nothing will make sense unless you go to class. No exams for his class just a few short writing assignments and one long writing assignment. He is always willing to help his students and even makes extra office hours when writing assignments are assigned.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	1	Philosophy	101	2	3	4	782957	4/23/09	Professor McGlone's class is very dry and very easy to lose attention in. He uses fill in notes which are organized in a way to help you write the essay but you don't need the book and can use the internet for everything, which may be clearer than his lectures. If you really want to learn this class is informative otherwise its a total waste
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	4	4	4	782957	8/28/08	I loved McGlone's class! The stuff he's talking about is sometimes boring but he has a very subtle way of making the class fun and entertaining. He doesn't take attendance but its pretty much mandatory if you want any kind of good grade in the class. Take really good notes because they will really help you when it comes time to write the essays.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	3	4	3	782957	10/23/07	The essay tests were difficult, but easy to predict. The only difficult part of the class was finishing the exam in the 24 hour time limit and actually showing up to class. I missed one or two classes and was left clueless when the exam came around, but I met with him and he was extremely helpful. I got an A, but again, it wasn't easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlone	3.9	0	Philosophy	101	1	2	1	782957	5/8/07	Boring lecturer. Finals and tests consists of writing two essays in a 24-hour or 48-hour timespan. Using extraneous information (information not learned in class lecture notes) is considered a negative when writing the essays. Smart, but cannot communicate with students. An A is difficult, but possible. However, too much work for an into class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	3	18098	12/27/12	He wasn't the easiest professor ever, but was extremely fair. As long as you put a little effort in, you will get an A. Very helpful and is an awesome guy. I would highly recommend to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	5	18098	10/25/12	One of the reasons why I switched to be a History major, McGuire has an excellent personality and sense of humor. Class is also a fairly easy A. I'd take any of his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	0	History	112	4	2	2	18098	4/3/12	I am a very good student and I don't usually have trouble focusing in class, but Prof. McGuire made it so difficult to stay awake. He's obsessed with Turkey (the country), and he has an infatuation with pottery. He's knowledgable, but unless you want to learn about Turkish dinner plates for at least half of every lecture, pick a different professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	5	5	5	18098	12/30/11	He is one of the best profs. for UGC112. Obviously if you couldnt get T.boyd take this professor. All I recommend is go to class take notes, and read txtbook. Don't be sloppy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	3	4	18098	11/28/11	Professor McGuire is a great guy, very funny and easy to listen to. He gets off track in his lectures sometimes and almost always ran past the 50 minute class time. His tests are fair but difficult if you don't keep up with the readings. I would recommend him to a student who is diligent and willing to work for their grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	4	2	18098	10/28/11	He is a great professor and really knows what he's talking about. the class isn't a cake-walk but his teaching style keeps you interested and as long as you are attentive and listen during lecture, you'll be fine. I definetly recommend him to everyone taking UGC111 and UGC112!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	5	18098	10/18/11	The man has so much swag. Doc McGuire is an awesome professor, best world civ professor def recommend! Weekly quizes in recitation which are easy and grade boosters. Only midterm, final, and final paper. Go to his reviews before the exams and he basically tells you whats on the exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	4	1	18098	1/1/11	He is definitely a scatterbrain. Half the time you will have no idea what he is talking about but he makes sure you know everything he thinks is important. since he makes the tests, if you go to lecture its an easy class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	5	5	18098	12/23/10	Really fun and funny teacher. His humor is a little dry but hilarious if you like those types of jokes. Memorize the terms and primary readings and you'll do fine. Tests are very straight forward and pretty much all mezmorization. Definetly recommend Professor E. Brilliant.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	4	18098	11/6/10	lectures are interesting and straightforward. Tests are pretty straightforward too, isn't hard to do well if you go to lecture
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	5	3	18098	11/7/12	Great Teacher but you must attend class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	112	4	3	4	18098	5/23/12	He has a funny personality. Lectures are fun to attend, but hard to take notes. If you got Avrill as your TA, then you will probably get a really good grade. His tests have no multiple choices at all. The research paper is fun (you can pick whatever movie you like). I did my paper on pirates and got 94/100.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	5	4	5	18098	1/16/12	He teaches 111 and 112 and I have him for both semesters and have never been more excited. Don Mcguire is by far the professor to get if you want to do well and actually have a good time doing so rather than being bored to death for an hour. His TAs are awesome most times and he is very dedicated to what he teaches. Just put work in youll be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	3	18098	12/9/11	AMAZING!!! Beyond the fact that he is easily one of the most intelligent professors you're likely to have, he teaches in a very understandable way. Tests=largely lecture & outside reading assignments (easy if you can at least seem like you read or listened) overall a very enjoyable class and I would take it again
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	5	18098	11/20/11	Prof McGuire is amazing!!!. Go to class study the lectures and you should be fine. Reading the book is very helpful but not necessary. I would also recommend to go to his office hours if you need help. He is really helpful and just wants you to do good. Besides he's really cool and nice. Def recommend you to take his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	5	3	18098	10/21/11	The man definitely knows his stuff and clearly has a deeply invested interest in the subject. More importantly, he makes himself very accessible to students with questions. As long as you pay attention in his lectures and possibly attend pre-exam reviews, you'll do just fine in his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	2	3	4	18098	1/18/11	Fairly difficult tests and the final paper is absolutely ridiculous. He is a pretty good lecturer though. Overall way too much work for a gen ed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	4	4	18098	12/23/10	Professor McGuire is a really interesting teacher.Attend class, do the assigned readings and take notes, and you'll be fine. Most of the people who didn't do well on the midterm/final are the one's who didn't attend lecture. Attend the review session w/ him before exams..EXTREMELY helpful.He basically tells you what to study. Recommended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	4	2	18098	12/21/10	A very fair class. Attendance is mandatory because of quizzes every 3-4 classes. Out of class work is easy but a bit tedious like the 8-10 page final paper. Know terms and literary passages that have been stressed and you will do fine on the exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	5	4	18098	10/20/10	A great professor with good TA's very good lectures and studying for his tests are fairly easy just memorize the terms and read the books and you should be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	111	2	1	1	18098	6/24/10	I was not interseted in history before I came to this class but Dr. Mcguire really captivated me with his funny stories and more then surface analyzation of the material. His tests can be a little difficult but are straight forward and if you study you will be fine. Recommended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	5	4	3	18098	12/23/09	If you go to lectures and recitation you'll probably be alright. Make sure to go to the end of the year review session too. It's like an hour long and will give you a clear understanding of what you need to study which will save you a few (finals week) hours. If your smart but lazy, you could easily skim by with a B without a ton of effort.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	2	3	4	18098	4/15/08	professor mcguire tries his hardest to keep the class interested. he talkes a lot about his trips and what he has seen. overall he is a good teacher. intimidating at first. MUST STUDY FOR EXAMS- he grades pretty tough
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	2	5	3	18098	3/18/08	He's a really nice guy, but he gives a lot of work and is a really harsh grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	111	3	2	4	18098	10/16/07	Because the class is early I fall asleep but other than that this guy at least tries to make the lecture interesting, if not then he is just naturally.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	1	5	3	18098	8/29/07	TONS of memorization. but prof. mcguire is a very friendly (and occasionally funny) guy, so its not TOO bad
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	000	3	4	2	18098	3/4/07	World Civ, I remember he used to post the keypoints to the lecture on the board, and when he would mention that topic my friend and I would be happy because we felt like we were doing out job. Great teacher for the topic though. Got us through boht World Civ pretty well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	316	4	5	1	18098	1/4/06	Really knows his stuff. If you have trouble he will help you in any way he can, tough tests, overall great prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	201	1	5	3	18098	8/24/05	He was an extremely great guy, and always went above the normal professor to help you out. He actually answered your questions quickly, as if he knew what he was talking about (pity he's one of the few thus far).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	5	5		18098	4/16/04	Really excellent lectures - interesting, informative, and entertaining.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	0	History	112	3	2	4	18098	1/8/10	tends to rant about useless things not really focusing on what we need to know for his exam.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	112	5	4	3	18098	3/19/08	He made UGC interesting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	4	3	3	18098	11/28/07	Mcguire is a nice guy and if you actually try listening he can be interesting and funny. only 1 paper and 2 exams which were easy if you did at least most of the work
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	111	2	3	2	18098	10/11/07	He is very good in the sense that he keeps the class interesting, but sometimes it seems he goes so far from the book that you not sure how to study for exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	112	4	1	5	18098	4/4/07	Excellent teacher! He really connects with his students. He writes important names and events on the board before the lecture so you have an easy study guide for tests. His workload is a good amount of reading, and a 8-10 page paper (which you have 2 months to do). His tests require alot of writing, but not hard if you read the text and attend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History		3	5	4	18098	3/3/06	I pulled my first ever all-nighter before the final and still managed to get an "A". Ah, memories of '94 ---
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	316	3	5	5	18098	12/1/05	Awesome class, lots of reading, a couple of papers, amazing professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History		5	5	5	18098	1/19/05	Great guy and will go above and beyond the call of duty to help you out.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History		3	5		18098	12/12/03	I thought he was a great teacher, especially for a huge lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	1	History	111	3	4		18098	7/16/03	Boring and difficult. Take the class with Boyd! He rocks!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History	111	3	5		18098	11/5/01	Amazing guy, lectures are terrific, though most think class kinda hard anyway.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald McGuire	4.2	2	History		3	3		18098	6/19/03	The class content is very difficult. Tons of memorization but he makes it interesting and makes class easier to take

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Naomi McKay	5.0	2	Psychology	351	2	5	4	1715632	4/27/12	3 hour night lecture and I never found myself looking at the clock waiting for it to end. This was my favorite class this semester. Even though the material was tough at times she did a really good job explaining it and was really helpful if you had questions. I loved this class, but it isn't for the faint of hard you have to make the time for it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies	105	2	5	4	1274807	10/4/12	awesome teacher! i would take any class she taught! i learned a lot but the work load wasn't excessive. dr. mcmahon (now grennell) was really helpful and was always available outside of class if i needed her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies	209	5	5	4	1274807	4/4/11	amazing teacher. definitely made the class fun. i never used the textbook - just went off her lectures. you can tell how passionate she is about music. unfortunately, she won't be teaching at UB anymore. best of luck with her on her future endeavors.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies	111	4	5	1	1274807	11/15/09	great TA, very helpful. not hard, easy a if you show up and do the little work. highly recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies		1	4	2	1274807	11/15/11	She is a good teacher and will keep you entertained. I did terrible in the class because i put no effort into it what so ever. She is reasonable though with grading though. U will watch movies and listen to music in class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies	111	4	5	4	1274807	1/11/10	Katie McMahon is better than the actual professor. Although she was only my TA I got an A in the class with barely going to the [profs] lectures. Shes very helpful, very nice, and really helps you learn the material in an interesting way other than just memorizing it. She also tries to incorporate music and food into her class =]Take her class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Katherine McMahon	4.8	2	American Studies	112	4	5	2	1274807	4/20/09	Katie is by far the best TA I've ever had. I had her for 111 too and made sure I signed up for her again for 112. She makes everything from lecture extremely clear and tells you what you need to know for the exams. She is also extremely nice and very understanding about everything. Definitely get her as your TA!! =)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	0	Mathematics	207	2	1	2	949492	4/5/11	basically she believes you get what you get so no rounding and no changing of grades. You def have to learn outside of class she has only given like 9 A's in her career at UB seriously. This is a hard class to get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	1	Mathematics	207	4	1	1	949492	1/15/08	I actually HATE her, she will be little you and treat you like your in kindergarten. I think she is a little crazy. She gives too much work, take someone else for Pys207.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	2	Mathematics	207	1	4	2	949492	4/25/07	shes a good teacher, very enthusiastic about teaching....which most of the students find annoying because she treats everyone like they're in kindergarten. Her exams are typical, but you have loads of hw every class and quiz every class and there are in circumstances make up quizes or makeup hws. if you have a choice, go for another
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	0	Mathematics	207	1	2	3	949492	12/23/09	She doesnt answer questions she relies on the tutor to let you learn her lessons and she doesnt go over the nightly assignments from the textbooks so if your lost your lost and you have to learn the key phrases that she says to answer questions on the quizes tests and homework too much cnfusion
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	2	Mathematics	207	4	3	1	949492	8/19/07	Ok teacher! Very Easy...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leslie McCain	2.2	0	Mathematics	207	3	1	1	949492	1/18/07	She was the worst teacher I ever had. She was constantly berating and attacking students. She would never answer any questions and continually interrupted and verbally attacked students who asked her questions. She had no respect for the students as individuals or for the class as a whole. She treated the class like it was kindergarten.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia McCartney	4.2	2	Nursing	3	4	5	4	1021411	10/23/09	She loves her subject and makes class interesting. I liked her a lot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patricia McCartney	4.2	2	Nursing	374	4	4	4	1021411	8/23/07	Dr. McCartney is a great teacher. She's very fair and keeps her material interesting. She can be a little disorganized at times, but she's very timely with exam grades and returning papers. She always gives prompt feedback. She takes a lot of stuff on her plate and can get frazzled easily! Don't push her too far!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law	511	2	2	4	250223	4/4/08	I took another Con Law class in undergrad that covered the exact same stuff, but McCluskey really butchered the topics. She was pretty much incomprehensible, so I relied on my undergrad notes for this class. She means well and is nice, but doesn't really deliver.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		2	2	1	250223	5/2/07	Unable to follow a thought,or keep a question in mind while answering. Uses 'panels,' completely ineffective b/c she asks nonsensical questions ('what is a winning con. arg circa 1800?'). Most reading is not useful, and reiterates the same point over and OVER. She doesn't listen to student responses in class + tries to pick fights. RUN!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law	814	2	1	3	250223	3/28/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		1	1	5	250223	8/21/05	McCluskey is the worst law professor ever. Avoid her at all costs. She can't complete a thought or give a straightforward rule. She never answers questions clearly. She took an interesting subject and ruined it. She makes you stand up when you speak in class, and nothing anyone says is ever good enough. I've never hated a class so much in my life.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law	511	1	1	5	250223	6/10/05	The worst professor at UB Law. A hard grader, but fails to have any knowledge of the subject. Highly irritating.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		1	1		250223	10/28/03	Horrible. I wonder if she even went to law school
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		2	1		250223	9/17/03	Arghhh! What a nightmare!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law	511	1	2	5	250223	11/30/07	She is very knowledgable and tries to communicate, but something gets lost
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	2	Law	500	4	4	5	250223	10/6/06	I know I'm in the minority, but I liked her. She's is very knowledgeable and friendly. In the beginning, I didn't care for her, but she grew on me. In the end, I realized I learned a lot. She tells you exactly what to expect on exams. Very willing to meet with students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		1	1	5	250223	3/1/06	I concur with everyone else's comments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law	511	1	2	5	250223	6/17/05	Either very smart or a very good actor, but lacks the ability to answer questions or present the issues to allow first-year law students to comprehend. Way too much irrelevant reading!! Perhaps she would be better for upper-level students. To answer her questions it is necessary to read her mind. Run!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	0	Law		1	1	1	250223	11/28/04	AWFUL TEACHER!!! NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HER. A COMPLETE DITZ!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martha McCluskey	1.6	2	Law		5	3		250223	10/18/03	Not great, but incredibly easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Aimee  McCrady	5.0	2	Writing	407	4	5	5	1755845	10/25/12	she's really nice and if i could i will be still in her class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann McElroy	3.9	2	Anthropology	312	4	5	5	1129578	12/9/12	Very knowledgable profesor. Course material was interesting and her wide range of knowledge and experience added to the overall effectiveness of the class, though I did find her to be biased at times in regards to the material she was teaching. Grading was very fair.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann McElroy	3.9	0	Anthropology	303	2	1	4	1129578	4/30/08	ridiculous, dont take her. she def is too old to be teaching the course. her knowledge is outdated and not useful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann McElroy	3.9	2	Anthropology	432	3	5	5	1129578	11/19/09	Dr. McElroy has tons of experience in her field. Knows what she is talking about. The comment bellow is absurd..Easy class as long as you attend on a regular basis, keep decent notes, and read the interesting books. final project is either a paper OR a presentation on a specific topic related to class. very nice professor. take any of her classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann McElroy	3.9	2	Anthropology	275	4	3	3	1129578	1/21/09	Good course, took it as an elective. Go to class, take notes, watch a video or two, and read the textbook chapters. 4 MC tests, based entirely on lecture notes and reading. 5-page research paper required. Easy A if you go to class and read.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael McGlin	5.0	2	Classics	111	4	5	1	1642242	11/10/11	Very good teacher who teaches everything very well. Had him for world civ 111...made everything make sense. Plus you get Boyd. Easily the best Recitation teacher. Also...he's mad interesting and cool. If you are taking world civ 111 or 112...try to get him...not just for Boyd though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	C McGrath	2.5	0	Philosophy	115	2	2	2	1358660	3/15/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR IS TEACHING IT. He is a horrible teacher, and no help at all to his students. His homework and tests are IMPOSSIBLE. And it does not help that the class is at 8 in the morning. Stay far away if you value your sanity!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	C McGrath	2.5	1	Philosophy	115	3	3	3	1358660	1/27/10	I know it's philosphy but man it's extremely confusing because he's not that great of a teacher and seems to read too much directly from his notes he brings to class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	101	2	2	1	618303	8/10/11	If u take the class take it for review, but don't take it if ur in a pharm major cuz it'll screw u over period.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	1	1	1	618303	12/18/09	He was the worst professor I ever had. There was supposed to be over 100 kids in the class, after a few, kids realized they didn't learn anything and there and about 5 went to class. His exams are ridiculous. The class average on the first 2 was a 59 and he said that was "great." If you need a good grade in this class, don't take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	1	1	3	618303	11/13/09	TRY NOT TO TAKE THIS CLASS AT ALL COST.THERE IS A LOT OF HARD WORK. His lectures are pretty useless. There is a quiz at every recitation either group or single. There are hard hw on website and advance hw which touches organic. super hard. unless u have a lot of time and is good at chem. highly recommend not taking him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	2	1	1	618303	1/20/09	never went to class once... got an A- but I have also taken chem before. the tests are very hard for an intro course. get olga as a TA i would have failed for sure without her. onyl take him if you HAVE to he sucks terribly
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	1	Chemistry	100	4	2	2	618303	12/23/07	CHE100: Not hard, not confusing; I would recommend this professor. 5 out of about 10 lecture quizzes count, 11 out of about 14 homeworks count, all 5 recitation quizzes/group works count, class is curved. Homework/Quizzes = ALL technical questions; TESTS/FINAL = technical AND theoretical... study the terms!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	3	1	1	618303	11/4/06	basically, you have to teach yourself everything. He's not that good of a teacher at all and has always complains about his powerpoints not working. For the exams, if you study the review questions he gives you and look over the questions at the end of the lectures, you shoud do fine. The exams are easy compared to the quizzes. good luck
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	4	2	4	618303	1/4/06	ok..this guy is crazy. he talks about penguins the whole entire year. he teaches u the easy stuff and not the hard. he doesn't know what he is talking about. infact..he hardly teaches u anything. i leared everything by myself. i got an A in the class b/c i worked for it. he's a bad teacher. but there isn't another teacher for this class...so g'luck
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	2	Chemistry	100	5	5	2	618303	12/13/05	yup
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	3	2	1	618303	11/18/05	he is terrible. i never took chem before and he was very hard to follow. I skipped the lectures sometimes and it didnt make a difference. The TA was MUCH MUCH MORE helpful than him. there are pop quizzes but they arent worth much. he just goes on and on and assumes that everyone already knows what they are doing which isnt true.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	1	1	1	618303	10/26/05	He seriously cannot teach! He cant stay on topic, and doesnt explain naything to its full clarity, then gives pop quizzes that are out of this world its insane!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	5	1	5	618303	12/9/10	McIver was a very funny guy. He would kinda ramble, wearing sandals, socks, and a bow tie. He didn't really teach much in class, but go to recitation and you'll do fine. He retired this year, so there's no use to really review. Godspeed, McIver.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	1	Chemistry	100	4	2	2	618303	12/3/09	Smart guy but not really a good teacher, not that helpful either. I went to all the lectures but i dont know why. Didnt learn anything in lec, my rec teacher really helped me thru the class. Exams are extremely hard, but theres a massive curve, a 50 is the average grade. A lot of hw too but theres a curve at the end of the year which helps.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	1	1	5	618303	11/4/09	TERRIBLE WORST TEACHER IVE EVER HAD... HE MUST BE FIRED
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	1	618303	11/18/08	HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT TAKE HIM!! Makes no sense at all. You have to teach yourself everything! What he says is on the tests is not. The way he asks questions is so confusing. If you get a good TA you might be ok. Chem 101 is easier! This is not an intro class at all. Lectures are pointless because he makes no sense. HORRIBLE!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	1	Chemistry	100	3	4	1	618303	11/16/06	he sucks, u teach urself everything, easy to pass if u do good on quizzes and tests but ull have to do all the work urself, nice guy if u talk to him alone
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	4	1	1	618303	4/3/06	hes a penguin-loving sucky teacher! likes to laugh at his own lame jokes but doesnt teach! very boring..dont even take this course it will get you nowhere!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	3	1	3	618303	12/13/05	If you give him something penguin related, he'll love you. He's a nut though. He speaks as if you should already know the material, although it's obvious (because of what course you're in) that you don't. His tests are hard too, but they're always curved. That's always good in a silly class, like his.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	1	Chemistry	100	3	3	3	618303	11/22/05	Hard to understand, and he complains about the slides lacking things. Only problem about not showing up to lecture is pop quiz... Try asking his alternating classes if they took a quiz. Jason carr is the best TA if he will ta again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	0	Chemistry	100	2	1	3	618303	11/12/05	THIS GUY IS A WACKO. HE TALKS NONSENSE THE ENTIRE TIME YOUR IN THE CLASS AND THE MAIN REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE GO IS FOR THE RANDOM AND DUMB QUIZZES THAT HE GIVES. IF POSSIBLE FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER FOR CHEM. IF YOU WANT AN A DONT GO TO LECTURE JUST ATTEND RECITATION AND READ THE TEXTBOOK
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	2	Chemistry	100	5	3	3	618303	9/7/05	He can't stay on topic! It's hilarious!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James McIver	2.0	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	618303	7/31/05	Jim is the head of the Undergraduate Dept. of Chemistry. A GREAT GUY!!! Super helpful, honest, and awesome at helping students coordinate busy schedules.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	4	4	3	501189	12/10/11	Dr. McKinnis is a great professor. His lectures aren't extremely exciting, but they're worth attending. In-class discussions are fun. He really enjoys teaching and loves college students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	5	4	501189	4/4/10	He is THE best ENG102 professor there is. So extremely kind hearted and loves class discussions. He is very lenient with the grading and class is actually fun! He loves to see his students do well and will work one on one with you if you ask for help. Best english teacher I've ever had. TAKE HIM!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	4	4	501189	5/20/09	This guy is a pretty good teacher. At times I guess his class can be kind of boring. But overall Mr. McKinnis is a nice guy, who wants to give his students a positive learning experience. He's also a pretty lenient grader even letting you redo essays that you do poorly on. Definitely recommended for 102 level english
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	5	4	501189	11/17/08	Put simply, it is a good, easy class. You write 5 papers but they are not lengthy. Mckinnis is lenient and very helpful. As an English major, this class seemed pointless, but he makes the class extremely enjoyable. Just do your work and you'll be fine. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	1	English	102	4	3	2	501189	5/22/07	Felt like i was back in high school. take with another teacher. unfair grader. people get same grades when clearly they should be different grades (more marks on one paper than other still get same grade)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	4	4	3	501189	4/29/07	Doesn't discredit your ideas & opinions just likes a class debate. Doesn't laugh about torture some people are just upset that they didn't do the work load and had a bad average. Several short readings with discussion card containing a question or comment you had about the reading, 5 papers; 2 short 3 longer, Chance to revise all. Great class!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	3	5	1	501189	1/18/07	Pretty easy class. Most of the work comes in the last half of the class. Have to go to class. If you act like his class really matters to you, you will get a good grade. The last two weeks are optional attendance for portfolio revision. Probably a good idea to do revisions throughout the semester instead of waiting until the end to ensure an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	5	3	501189	12/17/06	Lots of work, 2 2-3page papers, 3 6-9page papers, a self evaluation, and discussion cards. Discussion cards are a joke, I barely did any of the reading, just BS'ed the cards... Papers can be revised an unlimited amount of times until you have an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	4	4	501189	7/14/06	no tests, no studying, no memorization. just write a few papers. you can revise them so its not a big deal. kind of annoying because attendance is mandatory and you have to do discussion cards (which are a joke). just you pretend you care about the class and you will get a good grade
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	5	4	501189	5/4/06	Good guy. He honestly cares about how you do and what you think of his class... He gives great assignments, and isn't overly critical in grading. One of the best English teachers I've ever had, and this is because he accepts your opinions and doesn't tell you you're wrong... Easy A-, if not A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	5	4	3	501189	12/5/11	Professor McKinnis is one of the best professors I have had at UB. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you take his class if you are just trying to get English out of the way. He is a very kind interesting to talk to and he also cares about you as a person and a student.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	5	5	5	501189	3/29/10	I hearted having him as a teacher!!! Hes so amazingly nice and super lenient about grading. he really wants you to do well and provides the tools necessary. get into his class! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	4	4	501189	5/20/09	This guy is a pretty good english teacher. At times I guess his class can be kind of boring.

Definitely recommended for 102 level english
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	3	2	501189	12/16/07	He is a kind of weird but very nice guy. The class is very easy if you write your papers. The first major paper (genetic engineering) is stupid but all the other ones are not bad. Overall pretty easy and he is a very easy grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	5	3	501189	5/4/07	The class was easy and the professor is one of the nicest people I have ever met. It should however, not be taken by english majors. People who actually are decent writers and who wish to improve their skills have no need to be in this class. This class is great for others who just wish to finish their english requirment.. The cards are pointless !
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	0	English	102	3	2	2	501189	1/18/07	Teacher was hostile toward students with liberal or leftist political views, or anyone with a different perspective than he had. He would joke about torture in the class and harass those who did not share his conservative viewpoint.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	3	5	5	501189	1/2/07	he truly cares about his students and he's always there to help. the papers and discussions are exciting and inspiring. some said you can get an A without doing anything. it's not true and dun be fooled. attend the class, do the readings and join the class discussion, then you will do well. surely it's the best writing class i've ever had!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	5	5	501189	11/1/06	SO nice. laid back. i did no work, including the discussion cards and still got a B+....wouldve gotten an A+ had i done those cards. Take his class. not only for the easy A, because he is one of the nicest professors ive met and not to mention a pretty good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	4	3	501189	6/20/06	He was a nice guy, but his class was sort of pointless for me. It felt like 9th grade english at times for me, but I guess is a good class for non-english majors to get rid of the requirement. His papers are pretty interesting for the most part, and he lets you revise them all and offers good comments. Not alot of outside work, and no tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	1	English	102	3	3	4	501189	4/25/06	it's a real feat to stay awake in this class. he should be a highschool teacher. not allowed to leave for bathroom, stops class and gets pissy for 5 min if someone walks out early or comes in late. super boring. a few papers which aren't too bad. but SUPER boring, and highschool-like.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	3	1	501189	4/11/06	Eh. Not the greatest, but far from the worst. Paper topics are a little dry, but if you can string a few coherent thoughts together, you'll probably do alright. Take his class unless there's some other teacher you really want.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	4	4	501189	4/2/06	Nicest professor ive ever had and ever wil have most likely. Very easy grader, esp. if you prove yourself in the short essays in the beginning of class. Lets you re-do essays a few times. The only people that did bad werethe ones who didnt even try ont he essays. SHOW UP TO CLASS!!!!, he will be SOOOO Much easier on your papers in grading
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	5	5	3	501189	12/9/05	interesting, thought provoking assignments (other than the 1st one).class is an easy A if you attend class.class participation factors heavily into your grade.You can revise every assignment, and he genuinely cares about you and your grade IF YOU ATTEND CLASS.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	101	3	4	2	501189	11/10/05	If you participate in class he really appreciates it and your grade will reflect it.He prides himself on making his written classes a little tough. I believe there are better options than this guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English		5	5	5	501189	5/11/05	Great teacher, easy tests, easy reading, easy papers. Take a class with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	337	4	5	4	501189	4/15/05	A great professor; knows his stuff very well. Makes mythology fun and interesting without burdening his students with too much work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	5	5	3	501189	2/16/05	Very easy teacher. Topics aren't that interesting to write about, but he is a very easy grader.I heard horror stories about other 201 teacher who give a ton of work. Only 5 easy papers!Really easy A! I would recommend him highly!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	2	5	2	501189	4/7/06	well as people have said he's a really nice guy, and the discussions are great. But if you feel like taking an english class with not much work, this is not the one. Two 3-5 page essays and three 6-9 page essays. Fairly easy grader, but it's still a lot of work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	0	English		2	2	1	501189	2/13/06	he is so boring i almost fall asleep just looking at him, the papers he makes you write are stupid and hard to understand what he wants from you
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	102	4	5	1	501189	11/11/05	I think he was actually a really good teacher. I would take class discussion any day over reading boring short stories and taking notes. The essays and most of the class are based on current issues so it is actually somewhat interesting to read about them. I was so sick of reading old literature in high school. Refreshing. Allows paper revision.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	4	4	3	501189	5/28/05	Pretty good professor overall. Class is based on attendance, discussion cards (which are a waste), and 5 fairly easy papers. Topics are a little dry, but make an effort, stay on topic and get to the point... he grades fair. Small class so speak up, he's more friendly & grades you better if he knows you by name. Big on attendance, participation etc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	0	English	201	3	2	4	501189	4/16/05	A pawn of the English department, he teaches at Buff State, but he's at UB to make a little cash on the side. Doesn't have an open mind about things. Grades bad if he doesnt agree with or understand your paper. Discussion Cards are worthless and a hassle. Not much freedom in the class, go for Senden
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	0	English	102	3	1	3	501189	3/14/05	Horrible teacher...penalizes you for disagreeing...doesn't understand what freedom of speech means. Worst teacher I've had in 3 years at UB...boring and monotonous too...good luck staying awake
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John McKinnis	4.0	2	English	201	3	4	1	501189	2/10/05	Topics are alittle tough to write about. But if you stay on top of the work and come to class prepared he will help you out. Even though i got B's on most of my papers i still got an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laticia McNaughton	4.5	2	American Studies	118	5	5	4	1703433	3/27/12	I took her for Hist. of Nat. Am. I really liked her class. We did a lot of reading, but it was interesting. Also we debated in class a lot, which made it even more fun. Overall she is extremely nice and helpful. And made her classes fun and interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Measer	5.0	2	Education	414	4	5	5	1013207	12/11/07	Professor Measer is an AWESOME professor. She made me want to learn. EXTREMELY helpful, goes out of her way to help you out. brings real life examples into class which is very useful. Down to earth, awesome professor, ohh and she is gorgeous
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Measer	5.0	2	Education	514	4	5	3	1013207	8/2/07	Dr. Measer is great! She keeps things on an extremely practical level, which is a rarity for the education department. Her class is more like "Teaching Basics 101: How to Get and Keep a Job." Loved her lessons on resumes, and the mock interviews were really helpful. Grading is easy and straightforward. I highly recommend Dr. Measer for any class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	3	505648	10/15/07	He is the worst teacher possible. He never helps or teaches what you actually need to know. He gives homeworks on matlab but matlab is not taught in this course. It's like telling you how to add and then you have to write a program on how the world came to be. I will never figure out what the point of this course is with him as the teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	4	505648	12/14/05	Tenure must be nice. He wouldn't be so bad if it didn't seem like he hated you for being there. Won't review/tell you what you need to study, homework is all programming and the tests are not on programming. If this guy, were a horse, he'd have gone to the glue factory a long time ago. Class is like visiting a miserable relative in a nursing home.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	2	1	3	505648	12/6/05	I really needed his help at one point and he never returned my email. He "sighs" throughout his entire lecture. He obviously doesn't want to be there.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	1	505648	10/10/05	sounds like he has dust in his lungs (very soft spoken). Bitter and resentful of students. doesnt return HW, or give solutions. no help before an exam. do not take his class unless forced to do so!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	3	1	3	505648	5/8/06	In a word, Aweful. The class could be way more relevant instead it sucks. Teacher is guaranteed to put you to sleep before ...zzzzz. Just a pointer study for the final it's worth 50%
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	2	505648	12/14/05	To put it simply, AVIOD AT ALL COST. This is one professor who needs to be forced into retirement. He is an unreasonably bitter old man who doesn't seem to care for his students at all - when we asked what was going to be on the final exam (which turned out to be a nightmare), he replied, "You're big boys and girls, you can figure it out."
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Medige	1.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	3	505648	10/17/05	old and bitter. out of touch with reality. doesnt reveiw for exams, obsure, needs to retire, old koot!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	3	4	1	468349	7/3/08	Good guy. I enjoyed his class. He gives 3 lab projects thru out the course which I didnt enjoy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	4	1	3	468349	12/31/07	So he is pretty retarded... but if you go online to the biological sciences web page to his class, he is too dumb to take off previous exams from the last semester, so download them, he doesn't change the test questions from semester to semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	200	1	2	1	468349	7/16/07	worst professor in the world, can't teach, doesn't know what he's talking about half of the time. Don't need to attend class as long as you read the textbook. He does not give curve for tests or final and is E.bio. The class is hard as hell and very boring.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	200	3	5	3	468349	7/3/07	This guy is a great professor! I really learned a lot in his class, but prepared to work the labr practical is brutal, but if the class does poorly he'll curve it, our class was curved 13 pts. The lecture tests are pretty easy I only studied for a few hours before each. Great guy! I learned a lot in this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	130	2	3	1	468349	4/5/07	really no need to take this class. notes don't make sense. seems easy but the tests are not about anything you learned. labs are easy, but inconsistently graded. some labs i got a 100, some i got a 30. no rhyme or reason. i may be biased because i generally do not like science, but this course is for non-majors, so i dont think anyone taking it is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129130	2	2	2	468349	5/4/06	THIS MAN IS STUPID. doesnt know the answer to any question, boring, his notes dont make sense. labs are bs but dont get graded fairly. me and this kid had the same lab and he got 15 point higher. if u know bio u have an unfair advantage, if u hate bio ur screwed. take a different class, i warn you!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	2	4	468349	3/5/06	Boring lectures (you'll fall asleep at least once a class). Nice guy. Decent professor. Retarded labs and tests. That basically sums up Medler and his course. You'll need to visit his website quite often to pass his course because most of the information you need is on there.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	4	3	2	468349	1/4/06	Easy course, all you need to do is read the notes online, and take detailed notes of your own. Labs are a nice alternative to going to an actual lab. He is a boring professor, but a good teacher for the most part, he wants you to like his course. going to clas really isn't necessary
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	3	1	468349	11/23/05	Actually, if I studied, I'd have an A, he tests off his notes and extra readings, and a video or two. (However, when it comes to the labs, I wonder who's in charge!) I do agree that the class comes across as an upper level one and he assumes we know a lot to begin with. But, I also find him to be incredibly patient and hot! What lisp?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	4	2	1	468349	11/18/05	Its a lot of information for a course for nonmajors, admits he doesnt know things, the labs take way too much time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	2	3	3	468349	1/14/08	He's actually a nice guy. But class is really boring. I had a hard time sitting still and listening to him talk. He does his notes on the over head and his handwriting is a little hard to read and his notes are a little disorganized. The book is not helpful except for looking up definitions. Tests are easy if you have the notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	4	2	3	468349	10/4/07	His class is complicated and the lectures don't have anything to do with the readings. He acts like a pompous ass sometimes. Definitely not an endearing guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	200	2	3	5	468349	7/4/07	Waste of time and really was not that easy. Doesnt give a curve and it E.Bio
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	130	3	1	2	468349	4/11/07	I took Medler for BIO129 and BIO130 and hated everything about both semesters. The classes were boring and the lectures were dull. I also thought he was very unclear. Terrible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129	3	1	1	468349	12/24/06	worst prof. ever
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129130	3	1	1	468349	4/4/06	I had Medler for 2 semsters and the first one he was ok. he is really boring and does not know the answers to a lot of students questions. This year he has gotten even worse. i recommend that you avoid him at all costs...even if that means summer school.. cause he SUCKS!!! and should not be teaching science
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	5	5	5	468349	1/26/06	easy class, just read his notes. His tests are all about the notes and the videos! Goodluck!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	4	3	2	468349	12/9/05	You can miss every lecture (or sleep through it) as long as you read all the notes on the website and watch the videos. If you do the test reviews you'll do well on the tests. He has a problem staying on course with his syllabus, but that ends up working to your advantage. The second lab is really difficult but the first and third are a breeze.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	1	4	1	468349	11/21/05	I think that Professor Medler is very knowledgeable, and good at what he does. As for biology for "non-science majors," I definitely think that this class doesn't hold true to that because I have had to do more work in this class than any other. Oh yeah, to those who make immature comments about the way he speaks: grow up.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129	2	1	4	468349	11/11/05	Do not get tricked into taking this class! DO NOT read previous postings! They are cruel sick tricks! This professor is not only an idiot, he has no idea what hes talking about! The labs take forever and then get ripped apart by TA's that youll never even meet. AVOID THIS CLASS or expect 2 semesters of HELL
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	4	4	1	468349	11/10/05	Completely depends on the TA, the TA sucked this semester the guy who thinks he knows everything but doesn't and he's arrogant. Tests are easy but lab grades may hurt you if you got a bad TA. Bottomline is if you study his notes and read the articles, you'll get at least a 90.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129	3	2	3	468349	11/5/05	thoughtful (thinks before he speaks), listens to the students' questions & comments (tries to incorp. student comments into notes on overhead projector when they fit) & responds to everyone in a polite & professional manner. a large class (several hundred) but manages to engage students-this is an art. the book & articles are useful. req. attn.*
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129130	3	4	5	468349	9/6/05	Great teacher, tests are a little difficult, but it is bio. I learned a lot from this class and am going to miss it. not the tests, but the class. Have fun in this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129130	5	5	3	468349	6/28/05	EASIEST class I took at UB, by far. Attend and pay attention to lectures, copy notes off overhead, don't chit chat w/buddies, and you will ace the course. The book is not needed in this class and he lets you know that on the first day of class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	3	5	468349	11/22/04	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	3	1	468349	11/14/04	Not a bad class. The notes online are really helpful. 3 tests during the semester and one optional final exam to replace one of the 3 tests. Also 3 labs that are handed in during each of the tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	0	Biology	129130	2	1	5	468349	11/6/05	He does not really know anything about bio and just skips around w/topics with no organization. His TA answers all the questions students ask because he has no idea what hes talking about except for what he reads off his notes. He also misspells about 90%of his notes and writes them in an illiterate manner. Ex."I go to college" Medler"I go kollege"
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	2	2	468349	9/24/05	AHHHHHHHHHH! I can't take his speech impetiment. By far the most painful lecture ever. I can't even stay awake let alone pay attention. I have a feeling if I could pay attention, it would be an easy class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129130	5	5	3	468349	8/29/05	You have to just read his notes to get an A in the exams and the lab reports are easy. The easiest class I have taken till date.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	5	4	1	468349	12/4/04	DO NOT BUY THE BOOK! Class is quite boring and the just drones on. Overall though, if you take all the notes you need and read the readings it's an easy A for your nat. science requirement. No rec. for this class -- the labs are just 3 small, easy, reports that take one night to do.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	2	Biology	129	3	4	4	468349	11/19/04	Really knows his stuff. If you go to class everyday and take good notes, at least a B. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. Things may change, but he never used it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Scott Medler	3.0	1	Biology	129	3	3	1	468349	10/5/04	Don't buy the book, its a waste of money and is never refered to. The online lectures are very extensive and give more info that was given suring class lectures which are more direct. Read required readings they are always on tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brendan R Mehaffy	4.7	2	Law	406	4	4	2	1245289	1/5/11	Awesome class! Definitely must do the readings he posts, must participate and must attend class. Midterm is hard but if you study hard you'll be fine. Final project is easy and interesting. You have to work hard for an A but he is a great prof and makes you learn things that apply to real life. Definitely take him for this class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brendan R Mehaffy	4.7	2	Law	406	2	5	4	1245289	12/30/09	Great professor. He's very clear in lecture and is entertaining. Tests are difficult but if you take good notes in class and keep up with reading you will be fine. He's a very fair professor and i would strongly encourage you to take his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brendan R Mehaffy	4.7	2	Law	406	4	5	4	1245289	1/2/10	Cool teacher, Cool class! He doesent make you buy a useless textbook and the class itself is entertaining. The midterm was not very hard and the final was a group paper and project. Mehaffy takes forever grading your work so if that stresses you out dont take take his class. Great class overall. I highly recommend it for pre-law students
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Errol Meidinger	4.4	0	Law	731	2	2	3	633622	2/21/09	Int'l Trade & Environment - The class seemed difficult to me, but maybe because it wasn't that interesting to me. He is VERY socratic, but won't embarass you, just won't answer a question. Test was pretty tough, but he gives you an idea of what will be on it. Pretty tough class but he is a good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Errol Meidinger	4.4	2	Law		3	5	2	633622	11/16/05	Great professor who can make even property interesting. Beware - he loves the socratic method, though he is relatively polite about it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Errol Meidinger	4.4	2	Law	507	2	5	5	633622	6/17/05	"Did I somehow give you the impression that I answer questions? No - I ask questions. You answer them." Meidinger is Son of Socrates, but he knows how to use it well. Class is fun if you are well prepared. When the little smile appears, you either just impressed him or he is about to nail you for unclear thinking.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Errol Meidinger	4.4	2	Law	500	3	5	4	633622	10/6/06	Love him!! One of my favorites. Actually made me interested in property. I learned a lot and did well in the class - my only A. He's smart and nice - he actually attempts to get to know his students. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Errol Meidinger	4.4	2	Law		4	5	5	633622	8/21/05	Meidinger is great. Some people find his Socratic style intimidating, but he's really nice and completely brilliant. Get on his good side by being prepared for class and you'll be set.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	2	396504	12/23/12	Great teacher. He is very engaging, and teaches clearly. Good sense of humor too. You can probably pick up the vast majority of what is on the tests just by attending lectures and paying attention. The material is all available online in a variety of formats, and if you go over it a bit outside of class you will probably do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	342	4	5	5	396504	3/1/12	Although we are this level of edu, Prof Mele still makes sure we have progression in our proj, sincerely wanting us to learn something out of it. He goes OT to make sure we understand. Awesome, Crazy & Fun! Best prof in my UB life!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	211	1	5	5	396504	11/17/11	One of the best professors you can get for Sociology, dont doubt! take his classes and you will know why! No one teaches like him! Legendary!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	315	4	5	4	396504	4/3/11	Professor Mele is in the top three of best professors I have ever had. Anyone who has an interest in Sociology should take his course. And if you are doubtful about whether you like Sociology or not, take this course anyway. He is that interesting and just a very funny nice guy. A must take.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	111	5	5	5	396504	4/30/10	Professor Mele is really funny, and he is extremely knowledgeable. His quizzes are very easy and straightforward, definitely take this class!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	3	3	396504	4/12/10	Mele is a fine lecturer, but he's rather impersonal. On a good day, he's a hilarious, but don't go in expecting that. You don't have to read the book; you don't have to go to class. Easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	4	396504	1/12/10	Class was fun and easy! 3 Exams, 2 Quizzes, No cumulative final and no essays. Study the review sheet and you'll pass the exam with an A. Very common sense.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	349	1	5	5	396504	1/5/10	Prof Mele is fantastic, incredibly knowledgeable and keeps a 3 hour lecture interesting to the end. Be prepared to work and write essays.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	3	396504	12/10/09	Should be called "Common Sense 101". Very easy class. Mele is a funny, nice guy, and even though you don't need to go to lectures I'd say go because he'll make you laugh. He posts his lectures and notes online, the textbook is online too. All you really need to do is read the book and check out the notes before a test, you'll do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	1	396504	10/21/09	If you need to take soc101 just stop reading and take his class trust me
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	2	396504	12/16/12	Made SOC 101 bearable, super interesting, super funny. Would definitely take as many classes with him as I can
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	342	2	5	5	396504	11/27/11	Take a class taught by him at all costs! You won't regret it, one of the best professors I've ever had, great personality and extremely engaging. Would never get tired hearing him lecture. Wicked sense of humor and manages to keep the class interested even when lecturing about boring policies.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	211	3	5	4	396504	8/31/11	Very dedicated professor. Will spend an hour explaining the same concept if you can't get it. Went overtime into office hours to finish the material for class if need be. Adaptive to the settings. No textbook. Engaging and friendly...the jolly professor you'd love to have a beer with after class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	331	5	5	5	396504	4/30/10	Looooved Prof Mele! Great lecturer, woke us up every Monday bangin on that podium "Happy Monday Everyone!" ... Indeed it was
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	396504	4/29/10	Great Intro Soc class. It's pretty much everything you'd expect in a perfect 101 class. Def take it with Mele if you have the choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	396504	3/14/10	I took SOC 101 with Dr.Mele last year. Not only did he have a firm grasp on the subject, but his lectures were entertaining and he would always crack jokes. I would recommend him to everyone!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	4	5	3	396504	1/11/10	Class was very straight forward with most exam questions coming from the lectures. No papers, just 3 exams and 2 quizzes. Dr. Mele was an entertaining lecturer.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	3	1	396504	12/15/09	Lack of plus/minus grades should make you reconsider whether to take this class, everyone I know got a B when they deserved an A-/B+.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	3	396504	12/8/09	He's Really funny. And a very good proffessor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	2	396504	4/29/09	He's extremely easy. Never went to class, instead watched lecture online. No +/- grade
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	396504	4/14/09	Mele is a really funny and down to earth guy. The class is sooo easy. You can watch the lectures online if you don't go to class and there are only 3 exams (no final) the whole semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	1	396504	4/4/09	Mele is the man. His lectures are somewhat entertaining (for a lecture), but makes makes soc interesting. Funny, EASY EXAMS, note outlines online, really nice guy, EASY CLASS. Make crystal meth lab refernces in class. Hilarious.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	396504	12/7/08	You cannot get an easier class. Watch the lectures online if you don't want to attend. Do the practice quizes which majority of the exams comes from and I guarantee you will get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	4	4	2	396504	11/22/08	He is a great professor, a good class if you are willing to embrace small humors. Attendance Mandatory, but you can get most info from notes and the online lecture recordings. The only downside is when he lets the TA teach. Easy A if you pay attention and read notes, everything you could possibly need is online, skim ovr notes and u will b fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	2	396504	11/18/08	veryyyy funny!!!!!!!! very easy class if you go to the lectures, if not, just print the lecture notes online & go to the last class before exams. the review is enough to prepare you for the exams.... overall a VERY EASY COURSE - A MUCH BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO TAKING PSYCHOLOGY AS A GEN ED.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	4	4	3	396504	4/19/08	Teaching right out of lecture. Miss the lecture? View it online. $99 for textbook, notes, and access to online quizzes. Attendance is mandatory, though offers some bonus if you're there on the right day. Very fair. Miss a test? He'll give you a make up. Miss a question on the online quizzes for a good reason, show him effort and he'll give it to u.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	2	396504	3/21/08	cool/nice teacher. totally recommend!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	1	Sociology	101	5	3	4	396504	11/28/07	The class is boring since he just basically reads off the noted that you already have. easy exams and you can print the notes out so you dont have to really go to class. if you're looking for an easy gen ed this is it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	4	5	5	396504	11/8/07	Dr. Mele is a great professor!! He does go off on tangents, but you will laugh so hard. Exams are fairly easy, he doesn't show up for the them, his TA does. You watch YouTube videos, and interesting documentaries. I enjoy the class but I know there are others that don't. If you want to learn AND get an A take him! You won't regret it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	0	Sociology	101	1	1	1	396504	5/17/07	Bad class....... he goes off on unnecessary tangents and when his TA teaches... oh boy get outta there. Tests are hard, and he doesn't grade with + or -.... ABCDF is all you will get. 1/4 stars
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	3	396504	4/4/09	really easy class. just get the notes from online. never need text book, i wouldn't recommend even buying it. go to class, dont really need to but he makes it fun and interesting so you should. sometimes watch videos and stuff. always a funny guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	396504	2/23/09	Dr. Mele is a really good professor. He explains very well and makes sociology very interesting to learn. He has the lectures recordings posted online, so you can catch any missed materials later on. His exams are extremely easy. Just memorize the LECTURE NOTES and it should be an EASY A. You really dont need to read from the text. No +/- grades.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	1	Sociology	101	5	3	1	396504	12/5/08	easiest class i have ever taken. i didn't go to one single lecture and i still got an a in the course. the tests aren't completely reading based, but enough that if you do the reading and understand it you still get good grades. everything is online, including tests to help you study, which the actual tests are very similar to. would recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	2	396504	11/19/08	Great teacher. My schedule didn't allow me to make it to the class, except on exam days. Being able to print the notes out, and watch the lectures online and the practice tests help a lot! I would def. recommend this professor and his class. He make it interesting, it's not as drole as psych would be
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	1	Sociology	101	4	2	3	396504	11/17/08	Goes off on tangents too much. Skims the notes so you can hardly read them. Cancels class frequently and even has the TA run it sometimes which is horrible. she sucks. and you can't get a "+" or "-" so if you screw up one test youre done.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	3	3	4	396504	4/15/08	He's funny..and hot
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	349	4	4	4	396504	12/7/07	Great professor. He knows his stuff and gives good notes. Does a very good job breaking down and explaining the material. If you need to take classical theory, he's the guy to take it with.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	3	396504	11/9/07	Before i stopped going to class, he was my favorite professor, his jokes were frequent and hilarious, and the material was well taught... Everything he does is online, and before the tests if you go over the notes you could pull an easy 95. I strongly recommend him if you have to take soc 101
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	1	Sociology	101	3	2	2	396504	11/7/07	This class is terrible. It is so incredibly boring that you will have to physically force yourself to go. I was really looking forward to this class and now i wish i would have taken it with a different professor. i am so disappointed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	4	5	4	396504	5/16/07	This class was so interesting and Mele just made it that much better. You don't have to go to class if you dont want to but he is histarical and makes you want to be in lectures because he makes everything relatable
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	4	396504	5/13/07	Mele is a great professor. Optional attendance but you will not get an A if you miss it. Mele is funny and makes class interesting. The material he goes over in class is pretty much short-hand of the book and he adds a few things. Read the book chapters and what he highlights in lecture to get get an A. He grades A, B, C, D, F. No +/-, so be aware.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	4	4	396504	3/9/07	Really great and funny professor! makes class interesting. For exams, use the practice exams he puts on UB Learns because 1/2 of the questions are exactly the same. Didn't really use the book.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5	3	396504	5/4/07	The funniest professor ever! Tests are easy if you do some reading and the lectures are actually enjoyable.One of the best professors!Made the material so entertaining!! His TA on the other hand, not so good and a little arrogant.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	349	5	5	3	396504	11/3/06	He explains the material very well. Although there is a lot of writing involved, you don't really need the book to pass this class. He is very funny and knows that the material is boring but he tries to make it as interesting as possible by making quirky jokes. I would recommend that you take this class with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christopher Mele	4.5	2	Sociology	101	5	5		396504	4/27/04	Good and funny teacher, easy class. He made it an interesting class and it's pretty easy to get good grades in as long as you print out the notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	2	English	102	3	5	3	1362873	9/2/12	This class started off with horrid readings and the essay topics looked even worse but its wasn't too bad. Get to know her, she's easily available and always willing to help. It wasn't a class that you could just 'get by', it required a lot of time, more time then I'd ever give a gen ed. Overall not bad but you need time for it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	2	English	102	4	5	4	1362873	1/13/11	Holly was a great teacher, very useful and friendly. She really made an effort to connect with all of her students and assigned interesting writing topics. She did have a tendency to go off on some tangents (some of which hard to follow and confusing) but in the end, they made you think. I highly recommend Holly!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	1	English	101	1	2	2	1362873	12/30/09	English 101 is a gened, she grades essays as if everyone were an english major...she also says she doesnt like giving out As b/c students dont earn them, and she didnt...participate in class shell give extra points
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	2	English	201	3	5	4	1362873	8/10/12	Always there to help you. Made everything really clear for you to follow and make sure your assignments were in. She always tried to better you as a student and a writer. GREAT professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	2	English	101	5	5	4	1362873	1/6/10	It doesn't matter if it is only considered a gen-ed, you know what you're expected to do and if you do it well, she will reward you with that grade. Simple as that. Holly was a great teacher. She expects a lot of work to be done and she's always there to help if you need it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Holly Melgard	4.2	2	English	101	3	4	2	1362873	12/14/09	If you take this class Tuesday and Thursday be prepared to have work to do. For each essay (there's 4 major essays) you need to do 3 major revisions which can be difficult. She makes herself easily available, so if you're having trouble speak with her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tomasso Melodia	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	589	3	5	4	1063564	6/18/08	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tomasso Melodia	3.8	1	Electrical Engineering	303	2	2	3	1063564	11/29/07	He is a good guy but a terrible professor. Its funny because he goes RIGHT OUT OF THE BOOK. When I say that I mean he does the same examples that are in the book in class. Gives a ton of homeworks and the tests have about 50% of the homework on there. A lot of conceptual questions on the exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Juan Mendoza	2.8	0	Economics	205	1	2	1	611776	6/24/06	He is hardest grader I ever had. I would not recommend him!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Juan Mendoza	2.8	1	Economics	205	3	3	4	611776	5/3/05	This guy knows his stuff, but he has a hard time conveying it to his students. Homework/solutions essentially are the test questions. Not too hard but there are alot of intuitive concepts in ECO 205. Boring, don't miss a lecture though since he doesn't give out his notes, and otherwise you're lost.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Juan Mendoza	2.8	2	Economics	507	3	4	4	611776	5/14/06	I would say that Dr. Mendoza is one of the better professors in the Economics Dept.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Diane McMullen	4.8	2	Social Science	103	5	5	4	1655221	12/22/11	Prof. McMullen is seriously awesome. I highly recommend taking her class- you'll learn a lot about the field, and not to mention the fact that she makes class fun and self explanatory.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Diane McMullen	4.8	2	Social Science	103	4	5	3	1655221	11/30/11	Professor kept class interesting and enjoyable entire semester! Make sure to complete all assignments or she will not pass you. Had to go to a Health&Human Service agency to interview staff member and do a presentation for class. I recommend taking this class with her, you will learn a lot!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary McVee	3.9	2	Education	563	4	5	5	248171	9/1/07	She is one of the best professors I had at UB. She has a very fine and elegant style of teaching and leading dicussions which makes her unique among professors. She's very strong in pointing out the importance of issues, even if she has to talk about her own cultural experiences. She spents much time with students to listen to and to help them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary McVee	3.9	2	Education	669	5	5	5	248171	9/9/05	Shes very attentive. Her fine points are in her easygoing attitude and extra credit.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary McVee	3.9	2	Education	683	2	5	4	248171	12/15/05	Probably the best professor I've had in grad school. She expects a lot, but also is excited about the topics and helps you discover your interests and develop your own ideas.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	1	Political Science	304	3	3	5	1502113	7/2/12	very funny guy so class is enjoyable but his tests are pretty hard. takehome exam but you won't do well just using info from textbook. he goes pretty fast in class which is nice (he's cool and doesn't want to waste your time) but sometimes i left thinking, what did he just go over? gave little/no homework
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	101	3	5	5	1502113	9/6/11	He's the man...take his class if you can fit it into your schedule. If you can't and you enjoy history and political science at all you're doing yourself a disservice by missing it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	303	3	5	1	1502113	7/3/11	He is the only professor in my three years at UB who's passion for, and ability to teach a subject has changed my academic course for the better. Josh Meddaugh is the reason I became a Political Science major, and subsequently the reason I am going to Law School. His classes are ALWAYS interesting, information filled, and definitely worthwhile.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	306	4	5	5	1502113	4/27/11	Good guy. Young, laid back and a lot of fun. Two tests, one paper. Some of the mult choice come out of left field but generally a fair grader
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	306	3	5	4	1502113	3/23/11	Great guy. Reviews on all the tests and such, really wants the students to pass, not out to get you! A lot of reading is involved, and usually has a project at the end of the semester, two tests and thats about it. Very funny dude, loves his Yankees and bills!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	306	2	5	5	1502113	10/18/11	His tests are a kind of tough, so I wouldn't make him your first upper level class. But, he's an awesome professor, super engaging and interesting. Worth taking, you'll learn so much. Highly recommend taking American Presidency with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	306	4	5	1	1502113	7/3/11	If you take one of his classes, you're sure to leave with a smile, knowledge, and, if your motivated a good grade. He NEVER denies anybody help who deserves it, and is truly one of the few professors who's only concern is making sure every student learns all pertinent material. There really isnt a better, more fun, nor a more understanding teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	303	3	5	4	1502113	6/28/11	Meddaugh is a great professor. He's lectures are clear and he doesn't waste your time going over useless information. He is kind and understanding and helpful when you need it. I would highly recommend taking a course by him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	101	4	5	4	1502113	4/7/11	This professor is great! I took him for an intro to American Politics as a free elective and I loved it. He knows a lot about politics and American history. The guys is very friendly, funny, and fair...one of those classes you look forward to going to. If your thinking about this class, then this is the teacher you want.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Meddaugh	4.6	2	Political Science	306	4	5	5	1502113	11/29/10	AWESOME! If you have to take any class at UB take this one. 2 tests and group project(a poster presentation). He also reviews before each test. Extremely funny guy. He always has a joke or 2 hidden in each lecture. Overall, the best professor at UB and my idol.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	2	Biology	417	3	4	5	819377	1/11/13	She is a good professor. Yes she has sloppy writing but she writes slow enough that if you just copy it down as you listen you will be fine. A good teacher. Just attend and pay close attention ull be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	0	Biology	506	1	1	1	819377	10/4/12	She is not a good professor. She is moody and doesn't treat her graduate students very well. She writes notes so fast that she doesn't care whether or not her students can have them all. Her lectures were testing your memorization ability rather an understanding of the field. When she smiles,it is like she is looking down upon you inside.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	0	Biology	417	2	1	1	819377	9/29/11	she handwrites all her notes which are difficult to read due to her sloppy handwriting and made up abbreviations, she talks to fast too quietly, seems like she doesn't want to be there and does not care about her students at all, unprofessional and moody

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	1	Biology	417	2	3	5	819377	12/30/12	If she is your professor for a class, MAKE FRIENDS IN THAT CLASS. All her exam questions come directly from her notes she writes on a projector (sloppy) in class. Make friends with whom you can exchange notes. Definitely no curve balls on exams, and is an alright teacher 1 on 1. Get to class on time and get ready for old fashioned notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	1	Biology	417	2	4	5	819377	12/15/11	She writes quickly and sloppy notes on the over head that are hard to keep up with, her exams are fair but hard. She can be a bit blunt when it comes to exams, she scolded the class after the results of an exam did not meet her standards, telling the students to just drop the class. I also took Bio 406 (Signal Transduction), same story.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	2	Biology	417	3	5	4	819377	11/6/10	All those who have rated Dr. Medler poorly above are either incompetent or arnt a dedicated enough student to try and do well on her FAIR exams. She teaches EVERYTHING that will be on the exam and there are no curveballs or tricks she tries to use. If you show up to class and listen to what she has to say you might actually learn something
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathryn Medler	2.3	0	Biology	417	1	1	4	819377	3/11/06	She has to be the worst professor I have ever had. It was so obvious that she did not want to be there teaching a bunch of students. She didn't proofread her lectures, so they would contradict the book. She also berated the whole class b/c they could not take the exam in the same amout of time she did.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melinda Mejia	4.9	2	English	101	5	5	4	1374729	4/29/10	Great professor, highly recommend taking any classes with her. The assigned work is ideal and reasonable. She also gives time to each individual student when it come sto writing reviews and feedback on papers.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melinda Mejia	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	3	1374729	11/18/09	she is very caring about students and is a pretty good teacher. The essay that are assigned are interesting and worth the read. class made up of 4 essays and a portfolio at the end. lots of homework and reading. need to be in class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melinda Mejia	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	4	1374729	5/10/10	Professor Mejia is really great. She knows her stuff but teaches at a pace so that the whole class can follow, and she's great with giving individual attention when it comes to essays. I always knew what she expected and was never lost. The workload is very reasonable, and I highly recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melinda Mejia	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	4	1374729	3/2/10	She's super nice. She really tries hard to teach the class well and she succeeds. Take this class with her. There are some pain in the butt readings but you can't forget that every english class has them! =]
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melinda Mejia	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	2	1374729	11/20/09	She is a great teacher who understands how the students think. This allows her to connect to the students. I highly recommend taking the class with this teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Meloche	1.5	0	Library Science	523	2	2	5	1329531	12/1/10	Incredibly unclear about assignments and expectations, changes content of assignments with every restatement, tons of group projects that weren't on the syllabus. Got through an entire semester of User Ed without actually teaching anything. Seems like an alright guy, but a horrible professor, especially for someone who teaches pedagogy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Meloche	1.5	0	Library Science	506	3	2	4	1329531	3/17/10	Just about the worst professor I have ever had. Does not know subject matter nor how to teach it.. basically reads powerpoint slides for the class. Is unhelpful and unclear about assignments. If you do not need class one semester take it the next with the hope he is not teaching it. Basically a waste of time and money!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Meloche	1.5	0	Library Science	506	2	1	2	1329531	4/22/10	He is a terrible professor. He is extremely vague; he will not give a straight answer to any question. But he will not hesitate to indicate whether you are vague in a paper. He refused to give any sort of guidelines on what he required till about a week and half before our final project was due; which was worth forty percent of our grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Meloche	1.5	0	Library Science	571	2	1	4	1329531	10/21/09	Nice guy, terrible professor. Unclear about assignments which results in the student getting a poor grade. Rarely responds to e-mails. Didn't learn much of anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	142	1	2	1	200006	6/27/12	nice guy but not a good teacher. His lectures are boring and very confusing. Does more explaining theories and ideas rather than doing example problems. Tests were very difficult with the average between a 40 and 50%. I do not recommend this professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	1	Mathematics	241	2	3	2	200006	12/8/05	I didn't think he was that bad. He's a genuinely nice guy who will help you if you need it. His lectures aren't thrilling and he says "uh" a lot (he also gets mixed up because of dyslexia at times), but he puts a ton of notes on the board that help somewhat. The exams were fairly difficult, the quizzes were easy but were made up by the TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	1	Mathematics	241	2	4	5	200006	5/12/05	this guy speaks in a sign language.although helpfull personally but tests are so hard, going to class meaningless, i would rather jab a fork in my mouth than take any class from him.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	2	Mathematics	241	3	4	2	200006	11/19/04	Actually a pretty nice guy, obviously very intelligent. Doesn't really cover test material in class, though, and you rely heavily on former tests that he posts.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	2	1	1	200006	9/23/04	Doesn't know how to teach or do the examples he shows. Jumps all over the place. Constantly says umm and uhh.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	2	2		200006	4/26/04	Save yourself & don't do it. The first time he said, "I forgot how to do this, let me look it up..." I stopped goes to class, as did everyone else. Boring, extremely hard tests. Read high school calc notes if possible, less confusing that him.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	3	1		200006	12/1/03	If you took calculus in High School, Don't listen to him because he makes you confused. He is a very smart guy, but he doesn't know how to teach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	1	Mathematics	141	3	4		200006	10/13/03	He is really smart, but has no idea on how to convey knowledge to the students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	142	1	2	1	200006	5/16/12	He is a really nice guy and always willing to help if one has any questions during office hours or in class. BUT he is a horrible professor by nature.Poor guy was just born that way, not his fault. He does set 250pt at C but given his super hard exams its hard to do
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	2	Mathematics	241	1	4	2	200006	11/29/05	he's a nice guy but kinda weird. its a really difficult class and his tests are also difficult. if you ask him he'll help you. if you do go to class (which most don't) you must pay attention b/c he's disleksit(sp?) and you might need to correct him from time to time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	4	1	3	200006	3/3/05	Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his "games" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	2	2	4	200006	12/2/04	VERY BORING! Avoid him if you can and use high school calc notes. I only took Pre Calc and they was more helpfull than anything he could offer!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	241	1	2	4	200006	10/11/04	He was horrible the book would say one thing out in way left field... then in lecture would be something well right field... and the tests... yeah who they hell knows where that came from... never having him as a teacher again
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	141	1	1		200006	7/13/04	Avoid this professor like the plauge. Unclear lecture, unorganized examples in class, constantly is looking stuff up while giving his lecture, and the class is doing so bad that my 72 might end up being an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	0	Mathematics	241	1	2		200006	3/9/04	Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Menasco	2.0	2	Mathematics		3	5		200006	6/19/03	He is very very helpful when taking calc 1. He gives tons of examples and trys to his best to have you understand it. Class if very fast paced and requires lots of work, but is worth it w/ him. He is a really cool guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	639	1	2	1	187223	12/10/10	this guy is useless. doesnt have his point of view. relies on the book for all the questions asked. the course is useless.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	341	3	2	3	187223	4/30/10	This class was very atypical. We spent a lot of time playing chess in class. Of all the exams only 1/4 counted and tested ALL the years material even in the first part of the semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	341	1	1	4	187223	12/9/08	Worst teacher Ive had in my entire college career. In 9 semesters Ive never had a prof as bad as him. Teaching yourself cognitive psych is almost impossible, and by taking his class youre ensuring yourself to do that. I would have never gone to class if attendance wasnt mandatory and would have spent that time in the library learning on my own
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	341	2	2	4	187223	11/1/08	This man is the worst professor Ive ever had.His TAs do the lecturing, and its verbatim from the book.He has this innovative way of teaching which doesnt work.Tested on the ENTIRE class on the 4 regular exams and the ENTIRE class on the 2 midterms.Only good thing was only 1 of the 4 regular exams was counted.Points every day for attending.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology		2	2		187223	5/23/04	Bio of Memory sucked with this guy. He talks too fast, and all the notes are friggin graphs and tables. The book didnt help much either. Nice guy and smart, but cant really teach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	341	3	2	4	187223	11/16/10	not familiar with everything he teaches, he constantly mispronounced things horribly. He gives 4 exams and each of them covers 100% of the material that we are to learn the entire semester he said "I do this because feel that at the end of the semester by being tested on the same material repeatedly you will become an expert on the material" !?!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	2	Psychology	341	5	4	5	187223	3/16/09	I don't care what these idiots say. Dr.Mercado is a great guy, who really knows his stuff. The class is easy, just read the book, know the vocab at the back of each chapter, and you will get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	341	1	1	3	187223	11/21/08	Where do I start? I am normally a straight A student, and I am barely passing. HE DOESNT TEACH, TAs do all the teaching. He doesn't write the lectures (TAs do that too). He doesnt write the exams, and he probably doesn't grade them. Basically, his job consists of NOTHING. HUGE waste of time, HORRIBLE. I am so angry my tuition money goes to this guy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	0	Psychology	419	3	1	3	187223	7/9/05	This idiot sucks. A-hall. Condesending and has no clue how to teach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Edward Mercado III	2.1	2	Psychology	419	2	3		187223	4/12/03	The information is tough and he speaks very quickly. Handouts or UB learns would be a plus. However, he is clear and infomative and really knows what he is talking about.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	2	263099	7/23/07	Took this class before with another teacher and failed. I hate math but she is by far the best teacher Ive had in college. She made me actually want to learn and I did homework that wasnt mandatory. She made everything so clear, extremly helpful, flexible, and an all around great person.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	1	263099	11/13/06	shes the best! Very helpful and caring for her students
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	147	5	5	3	263099	10/30/06	Great teacher. I never understand math until I took her course. She definitely wants to see her students succeed. If you have ever struggled with math in highschool and have to take a class here, try her 147 or 148 classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	3	263099	11/15/05	The best math teacher ever! She is very helpful and reminded me of a high school teacher, she is concerned w/ class and we even had activities were we used candy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	4	5		263099	4/18/04	she is a very sweet teacher and will not move on until everyone understand each concept. she is easy going and by far the best math teacher for this course. easy class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	5	5		263099	11/15/03	great class. Incredibly easy. Tests are the easiest thing ever! Her voice is so soothing!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	4	5		263099	10/29/03	Best teacher I've had for math; always willing to help students. Tests and quizes are reviewed for and are nearly identical to what is reviewed. No text book to buy for the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	3	263099	11/27/06	Professor very clear with teaching and always willing to help. Tells you what is on the exam and does the exact same practice problems as the quizes 99% of the time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	3	5	5	263099	10/31/06	I just need a math to graduate, and I hate math with a passion. Becky has the tendency to get me interested in her class. She's a very patient and understanding teacher. I don't think I've had a math teacher that good since tenth grade and I'm now a Senior in college. She helps me want to do well in her class. It's been a pleasure being in her clas
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	147	5	5	3	263099	1/11/06	Great Teacher!! actually made me interested in math, I did the Homework assignments(even though they weren't required) she makes you want to get involved with math. she would also go off on tangents sometimes...easy class...give you extra time for graded assignments if you ask for it...very understanding
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	2	263099	8/12/05	Taken her twice, one of the best teachers I have ever had, actually made me like math!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	5	5		263099	12/3/03	the best math teacher i've ever had! Very easy class, not a problem to get an A. Hardly any effort needed to pass.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rebecca Metcalf	5.0	2	Mathematics	148	4	5		263099	10/17/03	Surly the best math teacher I have ever had!!! She actually cares about you as a student and will spend a great deal of time working with you one-on-one to ensure that you understand the concepts.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	201	4	5	3	1620137	4/8/13	READ THE BOOK! Text really isn't difficult. If you just devote an hour a week to finish the chapter, you are guaranteed an A. She also gives you 3 chances to get 100% on homework. Recitations are fast, quizzes are easy. Loved her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	311	2	5	3	1620137	10/20/12	This is a junior level accounting course. Its going to be harder than classes youve taken in the past. Book dry.must read in order to do well. Exams MC, fill in blank, matching, etc. Huge project  but have month to complete. She is really nice and helpful. Students might call her bad because theyre not expecting or used to working hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	311	3	4	3	1620137	5/14/12	Metzger is an auditor. plain and simple. she is very organzied and willing to help. the material is hard to teach. Projects are time consuming but easy, she is at least very fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	1	Accounting	311	2	2	3	1620137	3/8/12	Very tough course. Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying for tests and doing the projects. You would think she is a nice person but she can be insensitive. Very strict.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	311	1	4	3	1620137	12/23/12	Ppt slides render textbook useless. Save ur $, you WILL need it for SUA & Peachtree. SUA is a 4-person-group-manual-accting project. Don't procrastinate w/ projects, especially SUA: very time consuming. Don't let material nor Metzger intimidate u. She is fair, but keeps you on your toes. This class is a cold "welcome to the accounting program".
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	201	2	5	1	1620137	6/17/12	This class is black and white material. Understand the online hw and you will do well. MC in book sometimes show up on the test! I only wish she would have related the material to actual experiences she had. Seems intimidating but She is VERY helpful when you go in for help. I wish I hadn't waited for the last month!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	2	Accounting	201	4	5	3	1620137	5/10/12	She's a great teacher. Gives tons of examples and explains everything very thoroughly. drops 2 quizzes and HMWKs. The exams are not that difficult, just make sure you review the practice exams and go to the review sessions and you will do fine.

Word to the wise work alone on this project if you dont want to be accused of copying. She hands out zeros.. and a 0 on this project will likely mean you will fall out of the program. Little discussion about any grades she gives
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Metzger	3.7	1	Accounting	311	2	2	3	1620137	9/22/11	Materials are very hard in this course, but she's an alright professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	348	5	5	5	865404	3/14/12	Great professor! Really helps you understand the material. Buy the reader (you will need it), but do NOT buy the textbook.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	328	2	4	4	865404	7/20/11	She is a newer teacher and it really shows. She gets nervous while teaching very easily and is rather scatterbrained. When teaching, she tries to bombard you with a massive amount of information and work. She gets irritated and angry quite easily and doesn't except excuses very easily. Also, be warned she will change her syllabus a million times.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	315	3	4	5	865404	5/7/10	The notes she gave were helpful. The work was reasonable. Don't buy the book. You will need the reader with the articles in it. She is considerate of students' needs. She wants students to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	213	2	5	3	865404	5/12/08	I took this class last year. At the time I thought the research proposal was hard. Now I'm in grad school and had to write a research proposal. No one in my class knew how to do it, I was ahead of everyone else and I give the credit to this class. Thanks Cassi!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	213	3	5	4	865404	3/27/08	Cassi cares so much about teaching and you can tell! I love this class. Her lectures are helpful and the in-class assignments really help me to understand the information.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	213	3	5	4	865404	2/8/08	i loved this class. she was very helpful and was willing to meet up with students at all times. she was very clear in her teaching method and the in-class assignments were very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	1	Sociology	213	2	2	3	865404	12/3/07	You can tell she wants to help students learn but she doesn't make for a good teacher at all. I felt that she was a little scattered unorganized at times. It would be better to take with another teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	348	4	5	4	865404	9/26/11	I loved her urban sociology summer class. The readings were interesting and the in-class assignments were fun! Sometimes the readings were a little difficult to understand, but we worked through them with class discussions. She really seems to care about students and the classes she teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	328	2	5	3	865404	5/12/11	She's definitely not an easy A. She wants students to learn and work hard. But, I absolutely loved her class! It was a lot of reading, but totally worth it. She's really great. But don't take the class if you just want to coast through it, you won't make it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	213	5	5	3	865404	6/10/08	The only reason I say attendance is mandatory is because we do class assignments, but she tells you ahead of time when to come. Her lectures are read straight out of the book and her online powerpoints. She is very helpful, and is genuine. The material is not tough. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. It was expensive and I never used it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	1	Sociology	213	3	4	3	865404	4/11/08	She was very good at helping when you asked. But when it comes to lectures its kinda boring, she basically reads right out the txtbk. I didnt buy the bk,she posts notes on UB learns. She also tends to say "um" alot which can be a little irritating. a few in class assignments. 2 exams 1 (15-20pg) group paper which u finish most of it in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cassi Meyerhoffer	4.1	2	Sociology	213	3	5	2	865404	3/24/08	Cassi is funny and really helpful. She really seems to care and if you have to take Research Methods, this is your best bet!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michele Milano	1.6	0	Engineering	340	3	1	2	1633820	1/7/13	AVOID IF POSSIBLE! Dr. Milano lectures twice a week, and leaves the third to one of the TAs. The only way I learned stuff was to go on the TA days, because Dr. Milano's lectures are not too good. He gives way too much power to the TAs, most of whom seem to not like undergrads. Tests are open book/notes, and really were not that difficult for me.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michele Milano	1.6	0	Engineering	340	1	1	4	1633820	1/21/12	Worst prof I've ever had. Has no notes. Teaches by coming up w/ really poor examples that he puts on the board, which nobody can read, and repeats every class. Does not explain material, and cannot apply concepts to problems that deviate even slightly from HW problems, which are hours of math. Avoid at all costs...even if he is only option.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michele Milano	1.6	0	Engineering	340	2	1	4	1633820	12/14/12	Normally, I don't complain about my professors, but Milano is an exception. This guy does not know how to make a proper exam, let alone know how to grade one. His exams are one question long (50 minutes), yet people average in the 50's. I had one fully correct answer and he gave me 0 points for it because it was done in a way that he didn't like.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michele Milano	1.6	0	Engineering	340	4	2	3	1633820	10/31/11	He covers the same thing every day in class so we never learn anything new (or useful). Somewhat terrible to understand and he insists on writing on the incomprehensible blackboard. Homework is long and tedious but not technically difficult. Exams aren't difficult but most of the class has a hard time finishing. Expect to be going to the TA's.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	331	5	5	3	725875	12/22/08	Definitely one of my favorite professors at ub. She is really funny and her lectures are interesting. Attendance is mandatory since the examples she gives aren't in the book. Don't bother buying the book, its not needed. I just studied all the lecture notes for one of the tests and I got over a 100.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	331	2	5	5	725875	10/8/08	LOVE LISA! I have her for Social Psych, best class I've taken so far. 4 tests AND EXTRA CREDIT! She does teach from powerpoint, BUT she's very enthusiastic and makes class interesting! As long as you go to the lectures, it's an easy A or B (DEF have to study!) The tests are all basically lecture - but she's by far the best teacher I've had!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	331	3	4	4	725875	5/21/08	I wish she taught more classes. You need to how she tests and they are easier. You deffinitly need to study though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	0	Psychology	101	2	1	1	725875	4/29/08	Not that great. I didn't go to office hours, and don't know anyone who did, but she seems pretty nasty, just by some emails she sends out to the class. Its 4 quizzes, and they all get averaged, there a little extra credit, not much, but no curve at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	4	2	725875	1/18/08	Lisa is a good professor. She's clear and explains everything well. Recommended!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	101	5	5	3	725875	10/3/07	Explains all material very well...very helpful!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	5	2	725875	1/19/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	1	Psychology	331	2	3	4	725875	11/8/08	she is okay! Only think I don't like about her is that she teaches very fast. You also should go to class, she'll be asking questions about the examples she gives in class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	101	5	5	4	725875	7/26/08	She's awesome! All exam material is taken from her lectures and is pretty straight forward. Pay attention in class and study to get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	1	Psychology	101	1	2	3	725875	5/3/08	She has an annoying voice. There is no curve, just 4 semi-difficult quizzes (Im an A student and got around a C+ B- on all of them and worked pretty damn hard) that get averaged together for your final. Extra credit is there, but there isn't much. Don't take her... shes not really good at what she does
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	1	Psychology	101	3	2	1	725875	4/29/08	all she does is read off a power point..extremely boring and no curve at all only grade is 4 tests and she keeps them all..no need to go to lecture
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	331	5	4	3	725875	10/12/07	I took her for social psychology and she was awesome. The class was fun and interesting. The tests were not hard at all and I never read the book. As long as you go to lecture its an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	5	5	725875	4/21/07	Lisa is awesome. Her lectures are so much fun and engaging. She is very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is one of the nicest professors that I have had in awhile. I attended office hours and Lisa was very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Milford	4.1	2	Psychology	207	4	5	4	725875	10/14/05	Lisa is a very helful TA for PSY 207 although she teaches recitation, she will always make time to make an appointment with you to go over anythong you don't understand. Lisa is very clear with her presentations and is a fair grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Austin Miller	2.8	2	Mathematics	403	3	4	3	1752509	10/26/12	Tough class due to amount of material. Good guy. If you need help, he's there to help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Austin Miller	2.8	0	Mathematics	403	2	2	4	1752509	10/8/12	Professor does NOT help when you need it, is never on campus, does not have office hours, and the class is NOT an introductory to SAS course as stated in the description. If you don't know SAS proficiently before you come in, be prepared to fail. Tests are more conceptual than math related, so learn the concepts behind the math!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	5	5	1	477382	9/26/07	This class is a piece of cake as long as you keep up with readings and online participation. She's also easy to talk to and very helpful. I had a lot of fun in this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	0	Sociology	101	2	2	5	477382	5/7/06	terribly unfair when it comes to grades I had a 98 quiz avg a 100 written response grade and a 70 exam. and still only got a C. Exams were rediculous, would have enjoyed her class if it werent for the fact everything else besides exams was a waist of time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	5	4	477382	4/19/06	Great teacher. Made the class very interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	206	5	5	5	477382	7/26/05	Great teacher, easy grader. Changes topics if she thinks the class is bored, can't beat that...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	477382	1/10/05	Great teacher, doesn't round up for grading though, 92.9 = A-, not an A like one would hope
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	4	2	477382	12/20/04	amazing teacher... Keeps you interested and captivates you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	5	5	477382	11/21/04	Awesome professor. Often brings her own ideas into the classroom but willing to hear opposing views. Teaches thru discussion not just talking. Very knowledgable & helpful. You'll do well on her exams by going to class & briefly looking over your notes. Can't stress it enough: Great teacher!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	5	5	3	477382	11/11/04	easy class but this teacher needs to leave her own views and opinions outside the class! if you are not a liberal, don't take this professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	5	5	477382	10/22/04	Great teacher, sarcastic, funny, helpful, interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	5	4	477382	5/23/06	prof. very intelligent and informed, and tries to keep the students interested during lecture (although if you read, well, sometimes class is a dead-on repeat of the chapters). i say take it if it fulfills a specific requirement...fairly easy A. i find myself drawing on things i learned from this class in most conversations i have...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	3	5	4	477382	4/29/06	very interesting lecturer(even if you get a bad grade you'll learn something out of this class), but she makes the tests much more difficult then they need to be.. i think she got harder because people thought Soc. was a blow off class....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	3	4	4	477382	3/15/06	Four non-cumulative tests, but they are pretty tough !! Average grades in my class were around 70. She doesn't curve either. She's a generally interesting teacher at best though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	4	2	477382	2/22/05	She is absolutely GREAT!!! you should take her...tests are really fair...you can pass by just studying your notes real well, but to get an A of course you need to look over the text book as well. Participation credit is amazingly easy because you just have to make a good comment for the discussion.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	5	5	477382	12/21/04	easy class, easy tests, fun teacher, no recitation.. attendence NOT taken. always a plus :o)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	477382	12/15/04	Smart, funny and love what she does. She also gets on the nerves of the conservatives like no other profesor I have had at UB. If you have any clue about race relations and dont come from the Boondocks, you will get an easy A. There are some really dumb close minded kids at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	5	5	3	477382	11/19/04	Very good professor. Makes class intersting, keeps things upbeat, if she feels the clas is bored with something, she'll change to a more interesting, related topic. Tests are easy. She's very liberal, but in interested in good ideas rather then affirming her ideology.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Miller	4.7	2	Sociology	101	1	5	4	477382	11/4/04	Awesome professor. Jokes around a lot and still teaches you a lot! Test are very easy with a little bit of studying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	4	4	4	950503	1/18/13	Great knowledge of the subject. Very interesting course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	4	5	3	950503	11/27/12	I could not recommend Professor Miller enough. He's funny, he's good-natured, he's great at explaining his ideas thoroughly. I wish I could take his class again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	2	5	5	950503	10/27/07	He is a great professor. We studied really hard material, but he made it so understandable. Encourages participation, enjoys class' input, and he seems to like teaching! Very, very smart guy. If you need 301, take it with him!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	2	5	4	950503	4/21/07	Prof. Miller is incredibly smart. Helps make complex material understandable. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	4	5	5	950503	12/11/12	Prof Miller was fantastic. I loved going to class because the discussions were always interesting and he was very funny and easy to understand. If you read the assignments before class and come ready to have your mind blown, you will do well in this class. Would definitely recommend, I would even take this class again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	301	3	5	1	950503	8/21/09	If you have an ounce of good humor it is impossible not to love Professor Miller. He is intelligent and supportive. His course in crit. is engaging & truly satisfies as the range of material is relative and helpful to one another
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steven Miller	4.8	2	English	428	2	5	5	950503	5/21/07	another excellent young professor in the dept. makes critical theory enjoyable and accessible. laughs heartily at his own jokes--funny.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	1	Law	507	4	3	3	1220538	2/5/13	Kindof interesting but not really that useful of information. Mostly learned from book, played games and watched videos in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	0	Law		3	1	4	1220538	1/8/10	I actually thought she was nice BUT...completely disorganized, doesn't answer emails, unclear, doesn't seem to know the material, ect. We didn't even make it through all the material that we were supposed to!! All that money paid for a class and we didn't even learn everything we were supposed to. Good thing it's tested on the bar too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	0	Law		1	1	5	1220538	1/10/09	Agree with the previous comment completely. Didn't seem to know much about immigration law's details except as related to prisoner law. Would NEVER take a class with her again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	0	Law		4	2	2	1220538	11/29/11	Interesting trips to local jails Albion and Attica. But you could go to class completely unprepared and still participate fully. We were supposed to have a midterm she forgot, who knows what the final will be like. Agree w/ others about disorganization and scatterbrain. But generally likeable outside of her being a prof.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	0	Law		5	1	4	1220538	6/28/09	Professor Miller is the the worst instructor I have ever encountered. She is late, disorganized, rude, distracted from class and not on top of the material. Even other faculty and administration recognize that she's generally "lacking." TENURE is the only reason she's allowed in a classroom.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Teresa Miller	1.5	0	Law	689	2	1	3	1220538	12/4/08	Consistently 10-15 min. late to class, unprepared (either not having the materials or completely disorganized), dismissive of students' questions and flat out rude. Lectures well beyond the 11:15 end time. Takes forever to grade assignments. The quizzes are written horribly-- e.g., multiple choice questions with several correct answers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Mensch	4.4	2	Law		1	5	3	223304	10/7/08	Very sweet, wonderful professor who writes terrifying thirty page exams that take six hours to answer. Will do everything to prepare you for them that she can and will let you have a one page "cheat sheet" that you can write everything you need - but man, those six hours are tough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Mensch	4.4	2	Law		3	4	3	223304	11/18/04	Prof. Mensch is adorable. I liked her class a lot more than I thought I would. Getting a good outline from an upper year is really useful. Very approachable and helpful, exam is average. Fair to difficult grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Mensch	4.4	2	Law		1	4		223304	6/19/03	Eh. Very nice. Willing to give a lot of help outside of class. Bounced around too many ideas at the same time when discussing cases. Following her suggestions for the final doesn't help -- just guess, and then pray.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Mensch	4.4	2	Law		2	5	5	223304	11/28/04	good teacher, but does not cover mergers, which is a problem if you want to go into antitrust practice. she gives her typical 25 page test. you also have to give an in-class presentation.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Mensch	4.4	2	Law		3	4		223304	10/18/03	Great stuff. Not as hard as people say.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jonathan Mercantini	3.2	2	History	161	4	3	4	936706	5/13/07	If you enjoy history, you will enjoy his class. It is a good class to take if you want to skip American Pluralism. His lectures are short and sometimes interesting. Attendance is only mandatory for recitation. You write a few papers and take two exams, which are fairly easy. If you do your work well and pay attention you can get at least a B.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jonathan Mercantini	3.2	1	History	395	3	4	3	936706	12/16/06	Mercantini is an adjunct professor who teaches full-time at Canisius, but part-times it at UB to make some extra cash. He's a bit scatterbrained, and taking notes in the class is essentially pointless. He'll write random keywords on the board to emphasize some idea, but doesn't develop it. However, he does encourage critical thinking, and his class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jonathan Mercantini	3.2	1	History	395	3	4	3	936706	1/19/07	The person below pretty much sums him up. He doesn't really lecture and encourages discussion. Every student has to do a short (less than 5 minutes) presentation on a chapter from the text book. Their are papers due on 3 other books that he assigns. It's difficult to take notes in the class which makes the final not as easy as it could be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	102	4	4	2	1242199	2/24/13	Don't even bother going to class. Read the book and take notes and study those. Test questions are all from the book basically. Her lectures are boring and she just takes a few things out of the book and puts them in slides, and she doesnt post slides so I never went.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	367	3	5	4	1242199	12/14/10	Knows her stuff
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	366	5	5	5	1242199	9/8/10	A course to certainly enjoy and benefit from with this Professor at the helm.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	366	3	5	4	1242199	8/12/10	Extremely intelligent, knowledgeable and personable. Knows how to teach and prepares well for each class. Has style of teaching and research that stands out and provides feedback that allows for better development. Course requirement reasonable and interaction in course material a must. Broad spectrum of knowledge with the analytical expertise.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	367	3	5	5	1242199	4/25/10	Urban Social Geography was a great class. There is a LOTTTTTTTTT of vocab/technical terms you have to learn for this class, so be prepared. Sara is extremely helpful and funny though and really makes the class interesting and interactive. This my change in the future, but currently you will have to write 3 essays, take 2 tests, and a group project.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	366	3	5	5	1242199	6/17/09	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	367	3	5	3	1242199	12/12/12	very good teacher, she knows the material and makes sure you understand it as well. take home exams and group project but the class is farely easy. i would def recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	366	3	5	4	1242199	9/27/10	A+++++++
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	366	3	4	3	1242199	9/1/10	Excellent Professor, Adviser and Teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	2	Geography	367	2	5	3	1242199	6/19/10	Sarah is extremely personable, though this class has a lot of vocab terms reading the textbook and reviewing her lectures assures a good grade. Final project was a joke, its group work and even if you go off topic like some of the groups did in my class she still gives positive feedback.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	S S Metcalf	4.3	0	Geography	366	1	1	1	1242199	1/12/10	The worst professor ever! Try not to take her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English	201	4	5	2	1197593	3/22/10	She is energetic, enthusiastic, and always willing to help (even out of class). Great professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English	201	2	5	5	1197593	5/15/09	she's such a great teacher! i took her for 101 and 201 and LOVED her she's fun and u actually remember the stuff she teaches u. seems to really like what she teaches,lets you redraft ur papers. this semester she did take longer than last to get stuff to us and had to cancel a few days, but overall she's been awesome. BEST ENGLISH TEACHEER EVER
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English	201	4	5	3	1197593	4/16/09	She is a good teacher. Her class isn't hard; she's a very fair grader. She keeps this class fun and with her perky, energetic attitude. She always cancels class because she is "sick." But, I'm not complaining... You should definitely take her. She's super awesome and very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	1	English	201	2	3	3	1197593	1/27/09	A LOT OF WORK! empasizes on the silliest thing... such as the heading on the paper.and how you must write a complete (top to bottom) page to get credit for the assignment -.-;
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	0	English	201	2	2	2	1197593	11/12/08	Not exactly an easy grader. Very VERY fussy with silly parts of English that do not impede with comprehendability of paper This is coming from an Honor's student. Even though, in the end, I don't think there's another English teacher that gives you this many days off...although that doesn't make up for it completely. I doubt that she ever gives A's
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	0	English	101	3	1	1	1197593	12/8/09	Very hard. She doesn't give back papers for weeks. takes forever to grade them and never sticks to her dealines of when she says she will have her papers back. Be prepared to bug her 24/7 for work back. and be prepared to read useless books that are controversial to society. useless class in which papers have to be redrafted to get a good grade
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	1	English	201	4	3	1	1197593	5/6/09	She is extremely energetic and quirky. She makes class fun, most of the time she either cancels class or lets class out early. The only complaint i have about her is that she takes FOREVER to hand back a graded paper, way too long. Your next paper final draft would be due before you got the previous papers grade and comments back.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English	201	3	4	4	1197593	4/12/09	she really is a sweetheart.. she gives you time to revise your essays.. her assignments are not really difficult. I recommend her to anyone. Shes young and full of energy. You`ll enjoy her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English	201	5	5	5	1197593	11/18/08	She goes out of her way to help you and explain your papers. She is always available for help, and checks her email a lot, so that's an easy way to get ahold of her too. Attendance policy kinda sucks, but I guess that's the whole english dept. She is a fair grader, 4 papers total. I got 3 A's and a B. Guess you just have to know how to write!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Melissa Meyer	3.9	2	English		4	5	4	1197593	11/5/08	She gets overly excited about english, especially elipses. She also HATES !!!!!. (Don't use them). Pretty fun class though. If she teaches an english class I would recommend her. She keeps things pretty interesting all the time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	458	3	5	5	225080	8/8/08	Dr. Michaels is great. He is a "South Park" conservative, he hates conservatives, but he "bleeping" hates liberals! And he will tell you that. He is very critical dirtbag politicians on either side regardless. Nice to see a professor that is not a left leaning nut for once in this department. To do well you need to attend class and participate.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	295	2	4	4	225080	12/8/07	LOVED professor Michaels! Only 3 papers and a few quizzes (lowest grade is dropped. If you take the time to really write the 3 papers (which are only 3 pages each)you'll get a good grade. It was refreshing to have a conservative professor, since i can't stand liberals. If your liberal you may not like him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	309	2	4	3	225080	4/11/07	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		3	5	5	225080	3/11/07	A difficult grader, but fair. You will work hard for your 'A', if that is what you are looking for. As for the other stuff, ditto. He's definitely not shy, and rarely holds back...great professor!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		2	5	3	225080	3/12/06	All I have to say - any professor that admits to liking Team America: World Police and South Park (he's a Jew, no less) has got to be the greatest teacher at the school. Besides that, he's a fair grader, and allows students to speak their mind during discussions. Usually picks cool books as well, I haven't come across a boring one yet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	309458	2	5	5	225080	11/29/05	Probably the best history professor in the department. He knows his stuff, and is willing to share it with you. An outspoken conservative, he makes no qualms about his hatred of political ineptitude from either side. Always willing to listen to student opinions, and doesn't penalize you if you disagree with him. He makes you work for your grades.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	0	History		4	2	4	225080	11/4/05	Uck, horriably BORING!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		4	3	4	225080	8/12/05	Easy class, no test
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		2	3	3	225080	5/20/05	The guy's an ****. He gripes about Liberals poisoning the minds of gullable students, yet he's doing the exact same thing but from the radical Right. Tough grader. Easy B+/A- but an almost impossible A. He is reasonable with his workload though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	309458295	3	5	5	225080	4/12/05	Took several classes from him and enjoyed all of them. Gives informative, funny, sometimes biting lectures ripping Hillary Clinton and other liberals. Shows a lot of videos to help supplement lecture material. Hard grader, but no tests. If you're a liberal, beware, he may hurt your feelings.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	295	3	4	2	225080	11/23/07	typical lecture. grade is based on essays, and a quiz or two. not really too hard, but somewhat challenging.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	414	4	4	4	225080	4/10/07	Taken many classes with Dr. Michaels. This semester I have Cuban Rev. Focuses on numerous revolutions, including Mexico and Argentina. First paper is either an analysis of revolutions or perspectives on Che Guevara. Second paper is both an oral report and a group project for a significant part of the grade. Class isn't too bad, just a bit tedious.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	322	3	4	2	225080	5/9/06	One of the most senior professors in the department. Michaels' isn't shy about his conservative nature, but is always a good sport in debate. 3 short papers and a book/film review (or 2 longer and a book/film review, or even 1 really long and a book/film review). Let's you pick great movies like Scarface and Blow to review. Well read, great class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		2	5	5	225080	2/6/06	The only prof that made my grad school experience bearable. As a fellow conservative, it was nice to be able to speak your mind in class without being penalized for it. The rest of the department should take a lesson from Albie as far as intellectual honesty is concerned. Does not penalize left wing students for their opinion.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	309458238	2	5	5	225080	11/18/05	Great professor, mentor and friend. Refreshing professor due to his center-right views, a true rarity in the humanities discipline. No easy grader as he knows that his students are capable of doing greater work. In a way, he forces you to work and perform harder than other profs. I would highly recommend any course that he teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History		3	5	5	225080	8/24/05	Great professor. By far my favorite UB history professor. He does go off on right wing conservative spiels at times but they are usually amusing and he does not grade or judge students based on his political beliefs.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	238	4	5	5	225080	5/3/05	Clearly one of the better history professors on campus. Dr. Michaels is blatantly conservative, which is great if you are too, but he always welcomes debate from those on the left, unlike many of the professors here. His final was incredibly easy, and I look forward to taking more of his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	0	History	309	2	1	5	225080	1/13/05	Not a bad prof, but very conservative and not afraid to tell you about it. Stay far away if you think politics have no place in the classroom. Strict grader, does not give out many As. On the other hand, only assigns 3 papers. Lectured were sometimes interesting. Would not take with prof again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Albert Michaels	4.2	2	History	309	3	5	5	225080	1/5/05	Good teacher only 3 essays

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Philip Miles	2.8	0	Biology	369	3	1	5	642459	5/11/06	He needs to retire; he can't answer questions from 2 lectures ago unless he's got his notes in front of him. His tests R way too long. He goes way too fast in lecture & won't even let U see his notes. He gives his favorites A's no matter how they actually do & even gives lower grades to other students for answers that R basically the same.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Philip Miles	2.8	2	Biology	369	1	5	3	642459	7/19/05	Very challenging class with material I doubt very many people actually find interesting. It was a requirement and I thought that the course would emphasize more of the medical importance than the classification of thousands of fungi, their properties, and all distinguishing features. The exams are 100% essay question with medium 2 one page response
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Philip Miles	2.8	2	Biology	369	3	3	3	642459	4/18/06	Is a reasonably decent lecturer, but the material is not very interesting. Exams are usually moderately difficult but not impossible.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	101	4	5	3	651990	1/3/12	He was an awesome professor!!! I took World Civ 2 with him and loved it. In world Civ 1 I got a D+. When I took his class it made all the difference!!! Finished with a B+. Very funny and when you talk with him outside of class you can tell he cares about the students before the job. If you have the chance to get his class do it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	338	3	4	4	651990	5/6/10	Craigs the man. Just take notes and you're good to go. One of the best in this school, for sure. If you like metal, bring it up...dude's got longer hair than I do.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	141	5	4	5	651990	12/4/09	Funny teacher. I never really got the point of this class but it was fun. I HIGHLY recommend this teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	454	4	5	4	651990	8/12/05	Very interesting guy, really funny, fair grader, make sure you read!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	141	5	4	2	651990	10/18/10	Craig was great, I took a Discovery seminar with him - "History of the Human Experience" and I ended up finding the whole thing really interesting. He made discussion the priority over lecture format and it was an overall great class. Definitely got a lot of this and would suggest him as a teacher for others
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	331	3	5	3	651990	1/11/10	Awesome class. Very interesting material and subject matter. Prof. Miller is very intelligent and really makes you think critically about the material you are studying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Craig Miller	4.6	2	History	162	5	5	4	651990	5/26/09	Was a TA for HIS 162. Easy, funny, awesome. He was the only TA who gave out extra credit assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	191	3	5	5	1000841	3/30/13	Just Take him. No teacher is better than him. Extra Credit no attendance 2 midterms, 2 quizzes 1 final. No homework. Funny, understanding and gives 10/10 in quiz to entire class if its stormy outside(after cancelling the quiz and class).Just TAKE HIM! You wont get better.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	531	4	5	4	1000841	3/15/11	clear voice,good teacher. His handwriting is the worst , so u better listen to what he says, thats the only way u know what the sketch on the board means.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	331	1	5	5	1000841	5/14/09	Very well prepared and enthusiastic. Related well to students. Tough course but explained material well and was available even outside of scheduled hours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	331	2	5	3	1000841	5/4/09	awesome teacher only he made the class interesting grading is a little harsh as far as i can tell but overall i think he is great and real explains everything perfectly
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	331	2	3	4	1000841	2/2/09	He is very smart but doesn't seem to like lecturing. He only gives two grades: 40% midterm and 60% final. That is killer stress.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	531	1	5	4	1000841	5/20/12	Excellent professor. Very enthusiastic, knowledgable, and personable. Made himself readily available even though he was going through some medical issues during the semester. Will definitely take more courses with Prof. Miller.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	0	Engineering	331	5	3	2	1000841	5/25/09	Great class but the prof seems to wander repeatedly about how important he used to be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	331	1	5	4	1000841	5/5/09	Proffesor Miller is a good conveyor of knowledge for the most part but it seemed like he would have rather not been teaching an undergrad class. Our entire grade was based on two exams which were both pretty tough and entirely open-ended. Probably not the best professor if you absolutely need this class to graduate...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Russ Miller	4.0	2	Engineering	331	2	4	4	1000841	4/30/09	He genuinely cares to help his students, taking time to schedule extra review outside of class and helpful in office hours. Doesn't use powerpoint, which is great. Only thing is grade is 100% from exams, could be hard for poor test takers.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christina Milletti	4.6	2	English	387	3	5	4	278370	5/17/11	It was obvious from the description that the class would have a theoretical component. We discussed genres a lot. I learned a lot about many types of writing, conceptions of identity, etc. I think a few students weren't expecting the level of discourse--this wasn't reading for the sake of reading, wasn't about entertainment or pleasure.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christina Milletti	4.6	2	English	391	3	5	5	278370	2/18/07	So far so good. Early into the semester but I'm learning a lot.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christina Milletti	4.6	0	English	387	3	2	5	278370	5/14/11	Picks favorites and overlooks others, will go off on tangents completely unrelated to the material at hand, tends to get lost in rhetoric which makes any discussion/lecture of the material insufferable. By the end of the semester even the most passionate & vocal kids in the class had just given up on caring.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christina Milletti	4.6	2	English	392	3	5	4	278370	6/16/06	Very helpful. This was one of the most enriching classes I took at UB. I highly suggest it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christina Milletti	4.6	2	English	391435	3	5	5	278370	1/18/05	Fantastic professor - very encouraging, very personable, and extremely easy on the eyes. However her courses don't offer guidance, but rather lots of refinement through practice. No definite teaching formula but it works for her fiction classes. Fair grader: will sniff out your emotion, not effort

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	1	Management	301	1	2	1	1037623	4/8/10	Professor needs to understand that this is a business gen-ed, and as such is generally a requirement that we all must suffer rather than of any interest to most! She really needs to get over her field of study; its not that important. Avoid this section if at all possible if you want to preserve a high GPA!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	2	Management	301	4	4	3	1037623	12/28/08	fairly easy class as long as you went and paid attention. if you get a decent group, your in good shape.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	2	Management	301	5	5	3	1037623	11/6/08	Semi-interesting, the teacher is as interesting as she can be. She is fair, friendly, and helpful. However her grading scale makes it tough to get an A, I managed to pull it off but expect averages around at C+ or B-. Go to class and study her slides and you will do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	0	Management	301	3	1	1	1037623	12/8/07	Boring prof. Attendance mandatory. The only way you get attendance credit is by handling some survey at the beginning of each class. And if you're late for one minute, you don't get credit at all. Tedious and annoying class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	1	Management	301	3	3	1	1037623	2/15/10	Class Sucks- I don't recommend it to anyone
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	2	Management	301	2	4	2	1037623	12/2/08	Attendance is mandatory, all she does is read off the slides and is extremely dull. Her review sheets for the tests are the chapter sub-titles. Would not recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	1	Management	301	4	3	3	1037623	1/29/08	Attendance is mandatory... VERY boring class but pretty easy... not once did i know my grades from the exams (she doesnt use ub learns).. make sure you get a good group...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexandra Mislin	3.3	2	Management	301	3	4	5	1037623	10/12/07	Good prof.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vladimir Mitin	2.9	2	Engineering	240	4	4	4	827413	6/15/07	This professor was a very nice guy and even though I did not understand a word he was saying he gave us up to 30 points extra credit, the lowest grade in the class was a B. So if you just show up to class and do the homeworks and extra credit you will easily get a B. Just make sure to do ALL the extra credit stuff, which are fairly easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vladimir Mitin	2.9	0	Engineering	240	2	2	5	827413	4/23/06	I dont want to change anyone mind about this class, I think it is a great class. The thing hard about is that the book is absolutely boring to read and there is no clear cut examples. Lecture is the same as the text, so it isn't very helpful. I often times have to refer to online references and books to understand the material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vladimir Mitin	2.9	2	Engineering	240	3	5	5	827413	5/15/06	No idea what everyone is talking about, this guy is crazy! He is the best professor I've had in years.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vladimir Mitin	2.9	0	Engineering	240	1	2	3	827413	4/3/06	Avoid this class at all costs. NOT easier than physics 3, gives a course packet full of useless information, and has homework problems so vague you'll never understand whats really going on. Tests are similar to the homework but more difficult. Has a Russian accent, funny but difficult to follow at times.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	4320	3	5	3	526795	10/17/09	Super brilliant! I think he is the same professor teaching at Bloomsburg University. I am taking his criminology class and his class is always full. He is a natural teacher. That's rare and he cares about his students
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	350	3	5	5	526795	6/22/05	The best philosophy professor I have had. He knows so much and you learn so much. He really goes out of his way when teaching and doesn't have group exercises to waste time. He teaches the whole class time and makes you understand social theory. I recommend him to any student who is into philosophy and sociology.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	350	3	5	3	526795	2/4/05	He is natural at teaching sociological theory. He puts so much energy and passion into his teaching. It has only been three classes and I feel like I have learned so much already about sociological theory.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	294	3	5	3	526795	12/15/04	This guy is gifted. I took statistics with him and I am taking contemporary theory with him next semester. He is not a clown and doesn't try to be funny. he teaches with a passion that will make you learn more than you could ever imagine. Take his class if you can get in. He has a camp.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	350	2	5	1	526795	12/9/05	you want to take his class, then get your pens ready! this guy is a genius and you want to write down everything he says about social theory. He is genuine too. But he does give lots of work and the exams are long. took the last one and my head hurts. But still the best class I took even with the work. He is teaching the same class next semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	350	4	5	5	526795	4/17/05	great teacher he is interesting, insightful energetic and really knows how to have a very interesting and enriching class the best professor I had so far
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology		3	5	3	526795	12/30/04	I took my stats class with Babak (Anthony) and am taking a night course (ick) with him in the spring. I had origninally signed up to take a day class, which I would prefer. When I found out he was teaching the night class I switched. This guy is awesome and seems to enjoy what he does!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Babak Mohassel	5.0	2	Sociology	294	3	5	3	526795	12/8/04	extremely knowledgable, but down to earth. Knows his students and is approachable. Natural at teaching
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	4	763188	2/11/11	Good class. Was undeniably interesting and very fairly run. DO THE HOMEWORK YOURSELF it's your best shot at learning.Just a hint if you are assigned a seat in the back during the tests it's because you scored highly on his tests and he doesn't want people cheating off you lol.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	1	4	4	763188	12/14/10	Mohr is a really nice guy and he really knows what hes talking about. I suggest going into class because the material is really hard to keep up with online.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	3	2	3	763188	12/24/09	Make sure you know the assignments inside and out and take the practice test he posts online. The tests are very similar to the ones hes posts online
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	4	4	4	763188	12/17/09	Not too hard watch the lectures pertaining to the homeworks and tests. Also the practice tests are pretty much what the real tests will be he just changes the wording a bit or the numbers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	5	763188	5/18/09	Lectures are boring but his an amazing professor. You can tell he knows the material very well. The HW assignments are very helpful for the exams. Also the exams are very easy because he tells you want to expect on the exam. highly recommended
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	1	Economics	301	3	2	2	763188	4/26/09	Requirements: 5 HW (lowest is dropped), 2 Tests + Final. He gives practice tests and gives you all the information you need for HW. The class itself is kind of boring but it is relatively easy to get an A in. You can also do HW's in groups.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	3	763188	12/9/08	TAKE MOHR FOR MGF 301! SERIOUSLY it is easy getting an A in this course. He makes it simple enough for you to understand the material. Exams are exactly what he tells you to practice. With a little studying and effort on the homework, getting ATLEAST a B+ is a breeze.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	4	3	5	763188	11/6/08	Boring as anything. Not much work, but an easy A. He is smart but tough to follow sometimes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	405	5	5	5	763188	5/13/08	So easy, the class becomes worthless. Spells out everything that will be on the exam. I found myself becoming angry I paid for the class because it was so stupid easy. If you want a free A in a normally tough subject, take this class. If you want to actually learn something ( a rarity at UB) look elsewhere. Complete snoozer in lecture as well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	4	4	2	763188	12/30/07	Dont worry if you dont know what going on. His grading scale is ridiculous 78 is a A-. Just know how he could ask the question in every possible way and youll be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	5	763188	12/16/10	Class was very simple. If you do the work and see the teaching assistants for help, it will be simple. TA's and Professor Mohr help you understand the assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	402	4	4	4	763188	12/12/10	Structure of the course is very similar to MGF301. 4 out of 5 assignments, 2 exams, 1 cumulative final, and an extra credit opportunity. Exams based off of assignments and old exams that he posts on UBLearns. He is extremely boring and can be confusing at times, but it is not hard to get an A or an A- if you prepare for the exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	1	Economics	402	3	3	1	763188	12/21/09	The class is tough but Mohr makes it pretty easy. His curve is great and he always give partial credit even when you're answer is completely wrong. I'd def recommend him for Investments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	401	2	3	2	763188	9/3/09	I only watched reviewed lectures.. the ta's give u hints on the homework which is highly suggested.. if you get a good group for homeworks you should be fine. His stuff does come from his practice tests.. but they are not EXACTLY the same. Most of the time i thought i failed the tests.. but ended up with an A- in the class, seriously don't know how
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	4	4	3	763188	4/27/09	lectures are boring. hw is easy and so are his test. easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	2	763188	1/15/09	Class was easy. Got a B+ and didn't really know what I was doing. Final is the questions from the first and second exam. Difficult to follow though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	1	Economics	301	5	2	5	763188	12/8/08	Decently interesting class. Sometimes a bit tough to follow, but you can always go back and watch the lecture again. Tests are what you expect, and assignments are pretty easy I actually got 101% on 3 assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	4	2	763188	10/22/08	Online course: the lectures are difficult to sit through, but the class overall is easy. Practice tests given are identical to tests, multiple extra credit opportunities and easy homework assignments. Take him for an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	405	5	5	5	763188	5/13/08	So easy, the class becomes worthless. Spells out everything that will be on the exam. I found myself becoming angry I paid for the class because it was so stupid easy. If you want a free A in a normally tough subject, take this class. If you want to actually learn something ( a rarity at UB) look elsewhere. Complete snoozer in lecture as well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	5	4	763188	12/28/07	Professor Mohr is pretty boring. The ease of the class makes up for it though. In all honesty its not fair how EASY this class is. TA's give you the HW ans in there review, practice exams are 80% identical to the actual exam and there is no need to purchase the text book . Got an A- while studying only hours be4 the exam
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	301	5	4	3	763188	5/8/07	You have to TRY to fail this class! Go to office hours and make sure to get 100% on all your homeworks (he counts the best 4/5 grades). 2 Exams worth 35% and the final is worth 30%. He'll make the final worth 40% and the exams worth 25% if it helps your grade. Exams are almost identicle to practice exams. SUPER EASY!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Mohr	4.0	2	Economics	405302	4	5	5	763188	11/22/05	Great professor, somewhat borning, but teaches very well, always available for help. If you go to his office hours he will go over the homework you are about to hand in and correct it for you essentially. Exams are pretty easy, and curve gives over 75% of class A or B. highly reccomended
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	5	5	4	17347	5/18/12	Presents concepts well. Focuses on concepts instead of derivations, which is a refreshing change from many other professors. Really makes you understand the material too. Homeworks helped learn the details - how to solve problems. Tests were easy. Recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	5	5	1	17347	5/15/12	Easiest class ever. Exams are all multiple choice. 15 simple questions that are about basic topics, and then 10 problems from the homework. He gives you the homework solutions, and then repeats the problem with one number changed! You simply change that number and follow the solution. Plus he gives extra credit to make it even easier! Almost Chopra
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	1	Engineering	336	4	2	2	17347	5/3/12	Mollendorf basically just told us every single class to read the book instead of making an attempt to teach us the material himself. One-on-one he is kind of condescending and doesn't provide much help. Class material went very quickly, so classes felt rushed. Exams were good and all multiple choice. Homework takes a while, but helps with exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	2	5	4	17347	9/27/10	great class, great teacher.. he presents material in an interesting way... he is very interested in getting students involved in cool projects.. and probably brings more oportunity to students than any other teacher in UB MAE
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	3	5	5	17347	4/29/10	Awesome!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	1	5	3	17347	4/1/08	Excellent teacher. Well organized. Knows the material well. The homework is demanding, but very rewarding.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	4	4	4	17347	5/9/07	Guy is FULL of himself. Always brags about where he went, how he's building his own plane, and he apparently loves that his house has radiators because he told us many times. Other than that, he's a great teacher. Drops big hints on what will be on the 25 mult. choice question, open book/notes tests.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	1	Engineering	336	5	2		17347	6/19/03	Doesn't really care about students, but class is pretty easy, same exam year after year.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	5	5	1	17347	5/15/12	I only attended the first week of lectures, missed about half the homeworks, did not read the book, and did not do the extra credit (which could have added 6% to overall average), and received an A-. If you do all the homework, do the extra credit, and attend class you can get an A pretty easily, but I am pretty lazy....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	0	Engineering	336	5	2	2	17347	5/15/12	Heat transfer is a joke. Mollendorf just tells you to read the book every class, so I stopped going to class. The homework is lengthy, but you can just copy it from the solutions manual. The exams are EASY! He repeats the same questions from the past exams but slightly altered, and the homework problems he changes one number! Mega easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	4	5	4	17347	6/5/11	Extremely theoretical (doesn't show you eg. on how to do a problem). Homework often takes time if you're unclear what it's about. You won't know where/how equations are from/derived, just use them; it's like real world engineering. This prof is extremely friendly when u go see him. scored 17,23,19 in three tests and full 8 on xtra credits. Got A :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	1	4	3	17347	7/15/10	Loved how he was organized, and stuck to his schedule. However, his exams are more of reading tests than engineering tests. He is a great teacher, I learned a lot, but did not do as well, due to his very hard tests. They are open book, but many of his questions are very tricky.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	4	4	2	17347	5/5/09	You can tell he has an ego, but he knows his stuff. Going to class helps a little he throws hints towards questions on test. Open book multiple choice tests, but know your stuff before. I recommend reading book once before hw, and another time before tests. Not too bad if you put in the reading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	1	5	4	17347	11/28/07	Not arrogant at all. Extremely helpful, professional, and clear. Do the homework if you want to do well in the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	3	4	4	17347	5/5/07	Despite the fact that he is rather arrogant, He is extremely professional and you know what is expected of you from day 1. Best thing to do for his exams is READ the book and do the HW. He honestly wants you to do good and even gave us Extra Credit. Be warned though, exams are very tricky.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Mollendorf	3.9	2	Engineering	336	3	5		17347	10/26/01	Easy class if you go to class and pay attention, you learn quite a lot in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	0	Engineering	208	2	2	2	733500	4/10/13	He seems like a nice enough guy but his teaching style for an engineering course is something you can only have in a nightmare. Multiple choice tests and says that there will be no curve in the class. Rarely writes actual notes and flies through examples, Course becomes overly complicated as you're forced to teach yourself the material..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	1	Engineering	208	2	2	4	733500	4/1/13	All his tests and quizzes are multiple choice, which means there is absolutely NO partial credit (the last thing you want in an engineering course). It's nerve-racking taking his test and not seeing any of your answers as the possible choices. Even though I have a decent grasp on the material, I just cannot bear this man's testing style!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	0	Engineering	208	2	1	4	733500	5/6/12	Mook is a great individual and a great research prof, but he is the worst teacher. He has no structure at all and invents tests that have no connection to your book problems. He gives no hw and rarely does examples so you have to learn on your own. He does not show up every class and when he does he covers a chapter in 30 min. Learned more from TA
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	208	3	2	4	733500	4/18/12	Gives no practice problems, only looks at some examples in class and rarely goes through a full problem. Types of exam problems are mostly unknown so you have to know a wide range and depth although some questions are very simple.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	140	5	5	4	733500	12/15/08	This class was really dumb, because it was an introductory engineering class, but Mook was a cool teacher. He told some pretty interesting stories about his experience in his field of aerospace engineering. He was very easy to understand and also funny. I'd probably take this teacher for a different class, if he was available.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	1	Engineering	340	2	1	4	733500	5/9/07	He's a great guy, but shouldn't be teaching. He doesn't have time to do it. Missed 2 weeks of classes at the end of the semester on top of the other couple of classes he missed during the semester. No book made it really hard to teach material to urself. HUGE curveballs on tests. <--Sucked!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	340	3	5	5	733500	4/3/06	Hes a good guy. Explained things better than any professor I have ever had. His notes are the best. Study the old tests and look at his hints in his notes and you should get at least a B in the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	0	Engineering	208	2	1	3	733500	4/3/13	He doesn't really seem to care about this class at all and barely does anything new during lectures beyond doing shallow example problems (which he never really finishes). Quizzes and tests are all multiple choice so there's no partial credit available, but they aren't too bad. Don't bother going to class, just read the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	0	Engineering	208	3	1	4	733500	10/24/12	No assigned homework, so getting feedback outside exams is very difficult. Lectures mkae you think you know what you are doing, but as soon as you sit down to do a problem yourself, you have no clue. Lots of office hours though (go to the TAs, not his). Good guy, bad professor. Seems to have forgotten how difficult dynamics can be when learning it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	209	4	4	5	733500	4/26/12	Mook is a good professor because he intimidates you with the spectrum of material but the exams are quite easy as long as you have the grasp of what he goes over most in lecture. Fair grading; he WILL curve the class if too many people are doing badly. My only grief is that the class is so large it is difficult to get extra help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	208	5	5	5	733500	1/2/12	Probably my favorite professor so far at UB. He's really nice and tells lots of funny and interesting stories about his life and career. He's really good at explaining things. He's really laid back too, I really didn't put too much effort into this class and still got an A. The class was just some quizzes and 3 tests plus a final exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	140	5	4	4	733500	12/27/07	I knew I liked this guy for a reason! (re: pot smoking) Mook wasn't really put to good use for this EAS 140 class, but I'd take him for another course if given the option.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	340	4	5	5	733500	5/5/07	The mook man is a great guy and is really excited to teach the material. Very FAIR, he may throw a curve ball or two on the exams to make sure you were paying attention during class. He goes out of town a lot though so you'll rely on the TA's out of class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D. Joseph Mook	3.5	2	Engineering	581	4	5	3	733500	10/21/05	BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derry  Moore	1.0	0	Linguistics	207	1	1	2	1807772	4/10/13	Nicest Guy. Worst Professor. Very unorganized. Loses his trait of thought every two minutes. Makes you stay the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes and sometimes longer! Only makes you more confused if you ask a question in class. 6 page homework assignments that make absolutely no sense. Honestly, save yourself the suicidal thoughts and do not take this
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	4	2	1339105	12/17/12	Hw and text bk are not required but his own notes and problem sets. You can skip his lectures as long as you find a friend to complete the notes and study for it and finish problem sets before exams you will do fine. 75+ is an A which is impossible if you pay attention.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	1	2	2	1339105	12/9/12	If you like a teacher with a New Zealand accent who mumbles about stories nothing related, he's your man.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	4	1339105	11/9/12	This is a fairly difficult course but it is not hard to get an A on each test. As long as you start studying 3-4 days prior to the test you should be fine. If you do the problem sets he provides to study for the test and make sure you understand each problem you will have no difficulty getting an A. Preparedness is key.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	1	1339105	11/5/12	one of the worst teachers that has graced the campus of UB. He makes everything he says seem simple during lectures than absolutely nails you with tough tricky test questions. his accent was hard to understand. i would not recommend this class to any student ever.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics		3	5	4	1339105	11/7/11	ECO182A: Extremely helpful, very gentle. Can be funny, has a nice sense of teaching. Though it is a tough class, if you pay attention and be regular, It is easily possible to get a B grade. It's a class based more on understanding, ad if you are looking for an easy A, better not take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	1	1339105	4/19/11	terrible teacher teaches things easy and tests them extremely hard sometimes doesnt even teach test material you have to go figure it out yourself, if you are a business major do not take his ECO182 because of his class i am at risk of being removed from the school of management, a 75% and up is an A but most people get C's, good luck with this guy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	5	3	4	1339105	1/6/11	A pretty easy class but the teacher doesn't teach the material well. The tests are designed to trick you and while his reasons for doing so are good, often the questions become very unclear and hard to answer even if you know all the material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	2	1339105	12/5/10	i took this course last year and i really want to comment on him. CLASSES SUPER BORING. I want to know what kind of people who gave good comments on him. DON't TAKE his class!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	3	1339105	7/6/10	Do not take this class...Can't understand what the guy is saying over his accent and soft spoken voice. Even if he was clear would have no idea what he was talking about. Quizzes and Midterm are impossible if I was you take this class with another teacher or at a community college avoid at all costs....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	181	2	3	3	1339105	5/7/10	class is more difficult than it needs to be. morgan is not a good lecturer and tests are tricky. grading system is deceptive; i had an A going into the exam, studied like crazy and my grade dropped. TA GEORGIOS FARFARAS is a must in order to do remotely well. you will rob yourself by not going to his recitations. tough but doable if you work hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	5	1339105	12/16/12	He has his own Lecture Note and Question sets which are extremely helpful. If you study the question sets, you should be fine even though it is not mandatory. You can get an A if you got 75 or higher which mean 19 questions out of 25 correct. You should do fine if you study. TAs are not helpful, and no need to buy textbook.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	4	4	1339105	12/1/12	He is a very very smart man and is sometimes hard to understand. But overall, I think he is a good teacher. The class is very tough but also fair. He gives very difficult tests but the scale for an A is 75-100.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	3	4	1339105	11/7/12	His lectures are easy to understand but when it comes to the test the questions are tricky and hard. Getting an A seems easy because it is 75-100 but it's really not. Cannot figure out his accent..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	181	2	4	3	1339105	11/15/11	Good teacher, very quiet. Interesting way to make you take notes. Tests are rather hard in his class. you can get 30% and pass the class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	3	1339105	4/24/11	Great guy but not the best teacher, has a very soft voice and a canadian accent. Do not take this class for an easy grade, it was not easy at all. 72-100 was an A, but i never came close to it, plus no curve. Tests were hard period.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	5	1339105	3/23/11	Just amazing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	2	2	1339105	12/16/10	he is hard to understand, cant hear a thing in lecture n i sit in front of the lecture room, exams are very difficult, studied crazy, was at an A status in the beginning of the class, but the final was extremely difficult regardless how hard you studied, not an easy A class, if lucky get a B
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	3	1339105	10/30/10	great teacher makes economics interesting to learn about. the tests are hard but if you study a decent amount an A shouldn't be too hard. pretty much need to go to class since his textbook has to be filled in as you go. also, no homework! definitely recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	4	4	1339105	6/8/10	Awesome professor, Take him!! Very clear in his explanations and will make you love micro economics
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	2	2	4	1339105	5/5/10	This class is overly difficult for the content it covers.A is 75 and above, and you might even end up with an A going into the last exam, but then you open the exam, look at the questions, and end up wondering why you even studied. The exams are overly difficult and he purposely tricks you. I had a 4.0 GPA last semester but this class wont be an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	2	5	1339105	2/11/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Do yourself a favor and take Cherry. Much better- this guy is out of control.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	3	1339105	11/23/09	Lecture/recitation optional. Don't buy the textbook, just but his lecture notes. DO NOT panic if you fail the first two quizzes, and don't listen to his emails telling you that if you failed the first 2 quizzes you will likely fail the test. I bombed the first 2 quizzes and now I have an A-. 75% is an A, and exams are tough but straight forward
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	401	3	5	2	1339105	6/23/09	I took ECON 401 (intermediate micro) from Prof. Morgan at U-M. He is an excellent teacher who gives good, interesting lectures and doesn't put up with any bull. Class is not easy but exams and grading are fair. Make sure you study the math; his lectures focus more on the concepts (a style of teaching I prefer) than the algebra.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	4	1339105	4/26/08	Great economics professor. Tries to explain everything in a way you would understand. If you come to class it is an east B, if you try too it is an easy A. Only buy the lecture notes, Dont buy the Book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	3	3	4	1339105	1/5/08	very hard to understand at times bc hes such a low talker and lectures were sometimes pointless but overall he was a good guy and approachable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	4	1339105	12/3/07	Morgan was funny, concise and clear. Recommend him highly only if you get Farfaras as TA, together and followed closely, these 2 will gurantee you an A. Attendance non mandatory but he makes up for that with tricky exams. Textbook not necessary but problem sets are the order of the day. Exams all multiple guess, no curve but an A starts from a 75.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	3	3	4	1339105	11/26/07	Decent teacher yet his lecture notes for the course were incredibly convoluted and contained much pointless banter. There are also more than a few mistakes so be careful. He tends to mumble and trail off which makes him difficult to follow sometimes. sounds like geico lizzard (accent)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	5	1339105	4/17/07	I loved him. He is probably the best economics teacher that I have ever had. If you do your work and study, than getting an A is not difficult at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	4	1339105	12/15/06	Morgan is probably one of the best professors as far as his ability and conduct. However, as great as he is, the class itself is the real challenge. He explains everything perfectly, but the material is harder than simply listening to him talk and wrtiting notes. Out of all the professors, you want Morgan if you have to take the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	4	1339105	12/11/06	Nice guy, delights in tricking people on tests, class is pretty boring, but he has a good sense of humor... the three "midterms" he has we pretty hard..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	1	4	1	1339105	12/3/09	very smart. LOVES microeconomics. but his class is based for the most part on three exams (including the final) which are very difficult. do not be confused by the 75%+ A ;this is NOT an easy A. Most people get a C in this class and many fail. His lectures are comprehendable but exams are much more complex.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	1	1339105	11/15/09	he knows his economics very well. the material isn't that hard it is just the wording and understanding his logic that may get hard. if you pay attention and understand the material, you can pass this course. 75+ is an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	4	1339105	5/22/08	I liked Professor Morgan. He was very intelligent and interested in his work. The lecture notes were great... hope you like cookies and cakes! It's a rather easy topic, but you have to pay attention to detail. His grading scheme was rather interesting. 75% for an A, but I wasn't complaining about that.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	3	1339105	2/29/08	Morgan is a decent prof. who is very helpful. You can go to his office hours and he is very glad to help. His tests and quizs can be hard, but you need a 75 for an A. You have3 quiz's and 3 midterms. He also likes to trick people on them too. As for his accent, he had one, but you can still understand what he says.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	2	2	2	1339105	12/16/07	He teaches and tests you on his lecture notebook, not text bk. The book is long robust banter and you HAVE TO go to lecture to fill in the BLANKS in the book or you will do poorly on exams. Going to lecture is like nap time. He makes senseless jokes and wanders away in his own world. So now you know who saves you the most money on car insurance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	4	1339105	11/27/07	didn't mean the last post to be derogatory. i am sorry if thats the way it came off. i was merely referring to his dry wit and new Zealand accent. aside with a few prob with the lecture notes and his bias on certain issues (monopolism, government assistance) mr. morgan is a worthwhile teacher to have and i would recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	5	5	1339105	11/13/07	Awesome and funny!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	3	1339105	12/17/06	Don't buy the textbook, just buy his lecture notes. Class is hard, moreso based on the subject, not the professor. Very nice and willing to help. Recitation optional, I NEVER went to recitation. It's easy to get behind, it's in your best interest to go to lecture, but attendance is optional. Can/will relate to students. 3 MC exams, 4 quizzes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	5	4	1339105	12/15/06	Prof. Morgan is an extremely knowlegable. He is an excellent teacher and he does the class a great service with providing his own lecture notes. Do not buy the textbook I strongly reccommend going to class but you need to study everyday if you intend to do so, he has an intimidating method of patroling around the room. TAKE FARFARAS he is the best
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	3	1339105	11/27/06	Good teacher. Doesnt put you to sleep. You can buy all of his notes for the semester and you dont need the book. Neither class nor recitation are mandatory. Very helpful professor and TA's. Tests can be confusing but he drops your lowest.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	4	2	1339105	11/10/06	The class was tough if you didnt know the applications of it to the real world. It was important to go to every lecture since you dont use a book, but he is good enough to have created his own note set available for purchase at the bookstore.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	2	2	2	1339105	8/29/06	He seems nice, but if you have a conflict in your schedule, he will hate you. I had to plan a flight home and HE changed his final after I booked my flight and told me "I'm not happy with You," then proceeded to YELL at me during my final exam. Tests are rather difficult, he delights in tricking people into picking the incorrect answer.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	5	4	1339105	6/26/06	Such a sweet teacher. Clear and concise. Teaches real world topics and connects all the chapters to actual world problems we face or will face at some point. His only "bias" is that he tends to favor intelligence over stupidity. No book. He gives you notes to print out and there is a problem packet you can buy to study with. Recitation optional.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	1	Economics	182	1	2	3	1339105	5/19/06	There def. is bias when he teaches. Also hes not as good as everyone says he is. The way he words his exam questions is ridiculous and his tests are hard...make sure u review the notes and problem sets.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	5	1339105	1/18/06	morgan is the best professor. I honestly went to class all together maybe 10 or 15 times and I came in second out of 400 people. It's a tough course and his tests are def not east, but the study guides really help
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	5	5	4	1339105	12/7/05	Great teacher. Different but awesome way of teaching you the class. You actually learn
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	5	5	1339105	10/18/05	excellent note taking system, He teaches economics very clearly and organized. I look forward to his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	2	4		1339105	7/30/04	Not the teacher to take if you have no clue about Economics and don't want to work hard to understand what is going on. Morgan is a funny guy though. But watch it... he WILL call on you! My TA was hard to understand
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	181	4	5		1339105	3/29/04	Morgan is the man. He has a really cool accent, and he teaches very clearly. His notes are very helpful, and I like how he picks on random people during class. It's always entertaining.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5		1339105	10/3/03	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	0	Economics	182	1	1	1	1339105	10/31/06	not clear, tests are mad hard, don't take him if you can mangage it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	4	4	1339105	7/14/06	babbled on stuff no one cares about and is not on the tests. some lectures would be based entirely on real world economic problems, which i dont think the average freshman really cares about. you dont really need to go to lecture. problem sets are all you need. he was a good prof who challenged his students. no **** with this guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	4	1339105	6/11/06	morgan was such a nice guy. his notes are powerpoint presentations, which he put online for you to print and bring to class. SO convenient. explained stuff well. recitation is optional- i never went because my TA couldn't speak english. 4 in class quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. not bad, but hard course nonetheless.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	3	1339105	5/7/06	Decent teacher, but teaches the class with some bias. If you spend a little time learning how to do the problems and have common sense you'll have no problem
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	3	4	1	1339105	12/24/05	Extremely intimidating method of teaching. He walks around the room and picks on innocent victims. He is a good teacher though (I just didnt try) and I would recommend doing the problem sets before quizzes and exams. His curve is really good too. I suck at eco, didnt pass any test/quiz and still managed to get a C- which was shocking!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	4	5	1339105	11/19/05	Good teacher. As long as you do the problem sets that go along with the lectures, you will do fine. His tests usually have like four hard questions, but if you get all of the other one's it is pretty easy. And there is also a very nice curve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5	4	1339105	1/19/05	Nicest/Best professor I've had yet. His note taking system is outstanding. Go to class and put in a decent effort and you'll easily walk out with a B+
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	181	4	5		1339105	3/30/04	This is a GREAT teacher...and his notes make the class the more easier/better... but because he fills out the notes as we go along...you need to go to class =D
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	4		1339105	1/4/04	Not a bad guy, he taught very well. I didn't like how he presented a rather unfair and biased view of free trade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	101	2	5		1339105	10/1/03	Ive learned that I suck at economics but Professor Morgan was phenominal. Great lectures and very funny. I enjoyed him very very much. If you like economics hes the goto man.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter B. Morgan	3.8	2	Economics	182	4	5		1339105	7/17/03	Nice New Zealandish accent. Explained things very well, and has a great notes system. You HAVE to pay attention because he calls on random people in the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Milles	3.4	0	Law	1	3	1	1	1555179	2/1/13	Boring as can be with a horrible voice, but does teach you the model rules. Show up and participate in class and you will be fine. Just boring and doesn't answer your questions because he always plays devil's advocate.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Milles	3.4	2	Law	100	3	4	2	1555179	4/6/12	Good guy, very knowledgable. Easy to pay attention to. The exams are very long and difficult, he is generally a fair grader though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Milles	3.4	0	Law	564	4	1	1	1555179	3/30/11	Do you like psychology and sociology? Do you want to think you're being prepared for the MPREs? Take this class because you will not learn anything about the law.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Milles	3.4	2	Law	564	4	5	3	1555179	7/31/12	Good professor. Class can be a bit boring at times, but that's just because it's ethics. Great at explaining tough concepts. Even better at making them easy to remember for the final and for the MPRE.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Milles	3.4	2	Law		3	5	4	1555179	12/11/11	Excellent professor; interested & interesting. Easy to talk with, responsive, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about course material. Fair grader (not "easy," but fair.) Highly recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	2	Music	497	1	5	3	541790	3/22/09	he is a truely brilliant and very compassionate person. His love of life and teaching radiates in everything he does. His talent is unmatched in the percussion world.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	2	Music		5	5	5	541790	1/30/06	Anthony Miranda is the BEST teacher I've EVER had. If you are hard working and practice a lot you will get very good very fast! I couldn't ask for a more talented, caring, special teacher than Tony. He's god's gift to percussion and education. Anybody who thinks otherwise can come to Clinton 201D because I WILL fight them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	2	Music	400	3	5	5	541790	8/8/05	all around good guy, great personality, amazing player at drumset, marimba, and tympani. his record speaks for itself.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	0	Music	400	5	1	5	541790	7/20/06	Completely agree with the comments below, he is a fraud and a joke. Took phone calls during my lessons as well, got to the point where I would just come into a lesson and play purposely wrong notes to see if he was paying attention. (he wasn't) Caught him in numerous LIES, always embarassed to tell my peers who I made the mistake of studying with
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	2	Music	400	4	5	5	541790	1/30/06	awesome player and teacher. always positive and nice. best teacher for percussion period!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony Miranda	3.7	0	Music	400	5	1	5	541790	12/22/04	not qualified to teach anything more than drumset. takes phone calls during individual lessons, plays favortism, takes credit for achievements that are not his or simply don't exist. we want jan williams back. do yourself a favor and go to a real school of music and don't study with this joke.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Charles Mitchell	4.5	2	Geology	5	2	5	4	1318813	3/20/11	Difficult grad class, as grad classes should be. Exams were essay format but very concise, to the point questions. Expects an understanding of the material to be displayed- no b.s'ing answers. Do take his courses. Very enthusiastic and intelligent, as well as a leader in his field.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	341801	5/29/12	He wrote precise definitions on the board which helped me with note taking. Very well organized and treats every one equally, his concern for us was really shined. He knew the material very wel. I definetly recommend others to take his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	1	Mathematics		5	3	3	341801	11/21/05	His class is pretty easy, there was a class like once a week but i was a piece of cake. ALL OF HIS TESTS WERE OPEN NOTEBOOK!!!!!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	1	Mathematics	115	3	3	1	341801	4/15/05	Boring class. i read magizines or did homework through it. No need to do the HW or study in any way. Open notes everything. Notes = the textbook. Hard to understand his accent. Seems like a nice guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	2	Mathematics	115	4	4	3	341801	1/11/05	If you go to class, you should do very well... Class notes are helpful and mock the tests. Also is helpful with questions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	2	Mathematics	306	3	4		341801	7/13/04	His tests and quizes are fair. He gives good structured lecture notes. Sometimes it can be difficult to understand him, but he writes everything he says on the board, so you won't miss anything. His tests are similar to assigned homework problems.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	1	Mathematics	115	4	3	4	341801	1/19/06	good guy. some what hard to hear but he does oll the work on the board. Does quiz make ups and tests are not to hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	2	Mathematics	122	3	5	5	341801	7/23/05	English isn't perfect but writes out everything clearly on board, nice about answering questions in & out of class. Tests (can be tricky) are open-book but quizzes (pretty easy) are not. Come to class & do the HW. Reviews for test w/questions similiar to test. If you're a mathdummy like me, take Calc 122 with him in summer session J.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	0	Mathematics	115	3	2	4	341801	3/10/05	I think he will be a better tacher if he is taching where he is coming from coz his English is terrible you don't understand a thing and therefore the class is boring. He a nice person but not a successful teacher. he is better of with another job since he is good in Math!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	341801	11/29/04	snooze...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jemal Mohammed-Awel	2.9	0	Mathematics	115	2	1		341801	3/9/04	WORST TEACHER IN THE WORLD! Does not speak a word of English
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	5	257016	8/21/07	professor mohawk was a great guy. sadly he passed away in december 2006. most of the lectures were spent watching videos which were actually really interesting, but when he talked you could hear a pin drop in the room. ver respected man
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	3	257016	4/10/07	Quite possibly the easiest class i have ever been too. You go only if there is a film quiz. Recitation is where you learn. The TA's also give you about 90% of the questions on the midterm and final...take if you want to learn nothing and get a 4.0
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	111	5	1	2	257016	12/8/06	He never, ever comes to lectures. He doesnt write the exam, the TAs do. EXTREMELY EASY CLASS! you watch movies every lecture, dont buy the text, its a waste of money because you will NEVER use it. If you dont mind paying for mohawks salary by paying for this class (because he does NOTHING at all) then take it. Easy grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	1	257016	12/26/05	SO easy!!! i hate history and i pulled an A with ease. all you have to study is the review questions, which they go over in class and rec. Joo is an awesome rec teacher!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	5	257016	11/25/05	This class is very easy and interesting...and he is also a cool guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	3	4	257016	11/17/05	All you have to do i show up for rec. class you dont need to go to class unless you have a film quiz. Two tests (midterm and final) not a hard class by far.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	4	4	257016	11/7/05	Haha I wish this guy would teach UGC 112!!! This is got to be the easiest A ever....basically if you like to watch movies, have follow the movie(fill-in-the-blank) quizes, and don't want to learn anything....this is the class for you!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	112	5	4	3	257016	5/3/05	easy, easy,easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	4	4	3	257016	12/17/04	What a great teacher... you watch a lot of interesting videos and have random quizzes. When I say quizzes I mean "let's follow the videos and fill in the blank." He's a very humorous prof. and I would recommend him to everyone. (He also has a lot of crazy stories you'll all love)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	112	5	4	3	257016	12/7/04	Learned a lot in class, but need to think independently very easy class if you go to the lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	4	257016	8/2/07	He was the greatest man ever. Whenever he talked you couldn't help but pay attention. i miss him :(
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	111	5	3	3	257016	12/16/06	easy A, but, umm, he just died, sooooo... RIP
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	3	2	257016	1/12/06	this class was simple. watched films almost every class and it was only important if there was a film quiz. midterm and a final, review questions and reward questions are giving before the exam. just make sure you go to recitation for reviews and take the film quizzes. the tests are simple if you study the review questions. easy class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	101	4	3	4	257016	12/12/05	let me tell u ... easy class films everyday only stay at the lectures if theres a film quiz .. if u got friends in the class just get the reward question forom them .. midterm/final they rec=view almost every quesions that will be on it EASYYY

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	111	5	2	1	257016	11/12/05	I've heard this guy speak 2 times since the beginning of the semester. He gets paid to show us movies. It's an easy A and a waste of time. Go to lecture to find out if there's a film quiz, if not leave. Get the reward questions from a friend that was stupid enough to stay b/c they are on the midterm/final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111112	5	3	3	257016	10/27/05	Mohawk spoke once about beer and made a lasting impact...cute man. Recitation instructor, Jill Peters was amazing! She was comapassionate and passionate about her subject. If you take this easy A/class take her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	111	5	2	5	257016	1/19/05	Extremely easy course but did not learn anything. He's a fun guy and you'll receive any easy A. But if you're a history major i strongly recommend not taking mohawk
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	4	2	257016	12/8/04	Great class, you watch films that make the class go by fairly quickly. Really helps you out on the exams by practically telling you what the questions will be. Doesn't talk, but he is really nice when he finally says something.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	1	257016	11/27/04	Excellent class, so easy especially for someone not interested in History at all, Jill Peters is an excellent recitation teacher, very passionate, knows what shes talking about, dont even have to read in this class, just do the review questions and you can ace the exams
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	4	2	257016	11/15/04	the best it will
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	4	257016	10/7/04	Awesome class, great movies, very interesting, very easy, but you really do learn a lot, get peters for ressitation instructor, shes great too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	112	5	1		257016	12/14/03	Terrible professor...lazy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	1	History	111	5	2		257016	10/4/03	You watch tapes at every lecture class. One of the easiest classes there is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	111	5	5	3	257016	10/14/04	Super easy, very jolly. Nothing but movies... best history class you can expect.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Mohawk	4.2	2	History	112	5	5		257016	4/14/04	This man is the best! Loves his class, and the subject he teaches. Makes it easy for everyone. I couldn't ask for more in a professor.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	201	4	5	4	1245996	12/3/10	I had now Dr. Mojica as a TA for my basic chem class. Very knowlegeable and helpful. If you don't understand anything, go to him. He will help you until you get it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	108	4	5	4	1245996	5/26/10	Elmer is the best T.A that ive had in my time as a student. I was sometimes pretty confused before attending his class, but he always succeeded in making sense of it all for me and many of my friends. He gave me hope when there was only darkness. He cares about his students unlike any t.a i've had, and i highly recommend him to all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	5	5	3	1245996	12/21/09	He was the best TA ever and helped the class so much!!!!!!!! take this professor if its possible

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	102	5	5	1	1245996	12/4/09	Elmer rocks. The best TA I have in UB. To think our class is in the morning of Spring semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	4	5	2	1245996	10/12/09	Great Chem TA, had him my freshman year, and his primary concern is that you understand what is going on, only if you care though. I still, 3 years later ask him questions that deal with chem that are in my current classes. Great asset to UB and great guy to know.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	101	2	5	4	1245996	10/6/09	very helpful towards the students in lab and recitation. clearly knew his material and made general chemistry as fun as anyone could. highly recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	102	3	4	4	1245996	7/30/09	Really Great TA even if it was at 8 in the morning!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	108	4	5	3	1245996	8/13/10	Had Elmer for CHE 108. He reviewed all of the material we found difficult, helped a lot with the homework, and guided us through lab calculations to make sure we were not confused. Overall he's definitely been the most composed and helpful TA I've had at SUNY Buffalo
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	5	5	5	1245996	1/14/10	Elmer was a great TA. He made chem labs and recitations worth going to and cares about helping his students. He also makes class entertaining. If I could have him as a TA or professor for another class I definitely would.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	4	5	4	1245996	12/19/09	Elmer was my TA for my chem lab, he was the best TA I've had. If it wasn't for him I don't know if I would have passed the class. Broke everything down and made all the material crystal clear. Highly recommend him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	3	5	1	1245996	12/18/09	Elmer was the best TA ever. you should be honored if you have him as yours. He brings a great atmosphere and knowledge to the chemistry classroom. He helps whenever you need it and describes it so you can understand it easily. he also is a fun great guy and can put a smile on your face.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	107	2	5	3	1245996	12/17/09	Elmer is the most helpful TA anyone could ask for. he helped me through chem, my weakest subject, and in the end actually made me interested in it by the end of the semester. should of been the professor, hes that good.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	108	3	4	3	1245996	10/13/09	I enjoyed having Elmer as a T.A. for CHE 108. He was helpful and patient in lab and was good at explaining difficult concepts to students. Although serious about the material, the other side of him was laid back and nice which made office hours a breeze. I recommend him to everyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	2	1	5	1	1245996	10/7/09	The best TA I have in UB. Take him. He is strict but very helpful in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	102	4	5	5	1245996	10/6/09	He was a great TA who was always very helpful. He did his best to make sure we understood the concepts that we were supposed to have learned each week in class. Also he was very clear about what we needed to do each week in lab. It made Chem 102 easier than it really was.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	1	Chemistry	102	2	2	3	1245996	7/30/09	Really helpful TA always was there in lab to make sure you knew what you where doing even if I was incredibly lost.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elmer Mojica	4.6	2	Chemistry	102	5	5	1	1245996	1/15/09	Elmer was my TA for CHEM 102 and he was awsome- he was really chille n made sure we were always really prepared for quizes- helps you out with your labs too b.c he doesnt kill you for little mistakes. If you did it right =11/11. def take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Goncalo Monteiro	4.9	2	Economics	416	4	5	4	1283253	12/29/11	Honestly if he could you would want this guy to teach every course in the department because all the other teachers stink compared to him. Gets you to learn the material without making you stress out. Take ECO407H if at all possible because he's the best teacher in my opinion out of who teaches it. Friendly, considerate, and very helpful. THE MAN!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Goncalo Monteiro	4.9	2	Economics		3	5	4	1283253	7/30/09	Great professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Goncalo Monteiro	4.9	2	Economics	416	5	5	5	1283253	5/4/10	Goncalo is the man. He changed the way I viewed the discipline of economics. Tests are OK, but you will definitely have to buy the book and read it carefully. Optional final. Overall an interesting and funny man.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	328	4	3	3	220313	3/15/10	Fairly easy class. Moderate amount of reading. Takes notes right out of the text so it helps to read. Tests are right from the notes. Lots of notes given during class. Not the nicest teacher but class isn't too difficult
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	0	Sociology	211	4	1	1	220313	5/7/09	Honestly the worst prof. I have ever had. She gets defensive when you ask questions, her notes aren't posted, the class is painful to sit through but attendance is taken, the way she says reguardless drives me insane. Terrible experience. But if you have to take it with her, I higly suggest reading the text for the quizzes. Overall easy work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	211	5	2	4	220313	11/24/07	From the name of this class, I thought it would be interesting. Reading the text, it wasn't half bad. However, the class is EXTREMELY boring. She lectures off of notes and goes a mile a minute, while everyone is too busy trying to copy them down in time to hear a word she is saying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	211	4	4	4	220313	7/4/07	SHe lectures right from slides that are right from the book, so all you gotta do is either pay attention in class, or read the book. She's good at lettin you know what's going to be on tests, but she talks a lot and uses a very large vocabulary alllll the time, which gets annoying when trying to take notes, but she's smart and the class was fun
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology		2	4	4	220313	9/21/05	Very tough prof, but interesting and fair. She expects grad level work and recognizes progress with the same. I liked that she wouldn't sit idly by when half the class worked hard and the other half slacked. No one slides through. Also, very well thought out notes and readings. I learned so much and I am not even a Soc major.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	211	5	3	4	220313	5/28/05	Take this course for American Pluralism... it's so easy. She gives a quiz each week (well almost each week) plus 2 bonus quizzes to drop your lowest w/10 questions on each that can be answered from the lecture notes (70%), which you have to take your self so show up for class plus she takes attendance (10%). Also a paper & presentation on it (20%).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	328	1	4	5	220313	1/5/10	If you are a hard working student who wants to learn about social stratification, I highly recommend this class. Dr Moore will prepare you for graduate level work,she is fair and incredibly knowledgeable. If you are a whiny slacker find another course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	0	Sociology	211	3	1	4	220313	4/9/08	I don't know if I've ever had a worse professor. She made her TA do all the work, and when the kids know more than she does about a subject, she yells at them. Her notes are more like paragraphs and are filled with typos, and she gives you no opportunity to write them all down (they're not posted). She's just an idiot. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	2	Sociology	211	5	2	4	220313	11/24/07	From the name of this class, I thought it would be interesting. Reading the text, it wasn't half bad. However, the class is EXTREMELY
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brenda Moore	3.0	0	Sociology	211	1	1	5	220313	7/24/06	She is the worst teacher I have EVER had. She makes NO sense. Her "notes" are straight from the book, so dont even bother copying them. Her quizes are easy but watch out for her paper, if you dont do it EXACTLY like she wants it you will fail. She is the kind of person who just likes the sound of her own voice

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	151	5	4	2	949506	4/30/10	P. J. Moore was a sweet spanish teacher. Intermediate is a good choice if you have a regents level knowledge of the language and don't want to come in for MTWRF classes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	207	5	5	4	949506	12/17/09	Probably the best Spanish teacher I've had in my 8 years of Spanish. Papers are open ended homework isn't "mandatory" but him might ding you points in participation. He makes a Spanish class that could be boring and monotonous something interesting and entertaining
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	302	3	5	2	949506	5/25/07	American teacher with PERFECT spanish. I find it easier to learn grammar with non-native speakers. Does not ask for a whole lot. Cute, funny and a good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	152	5	5	5	949506	3/21/10	He's such a good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	152	3	5	3	949506	4/28/09	Highly Recommended! I always knew where I stood in the class regarding GPA. Great teacher- friendly, approachable, funny. Not necessarily an easy A, but if you do the work you can get a good grade. Make sure you buy a book for the class you will use it alot. Ask him to do some impressions of Spanish accents-pretty funny.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Patrick Moore	4.7	2	Languages	102	3	3	4	949506	1/18/07	Professor was very patient with the students overall. At the beginning of the class he seemed to grow a little impatient, but to his credited he adjusted his style to meet the expectations of the students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	0	English	101	5	1	4	287645	2/13/08	I'm only about 3weeks in, and I hate this! Skipper Dave is a nice guy for sure, but as far as class, he talks down to us really hard. So basically, if you know elementary vocabulary, if you know basic grammar rules, if you know there/their/they're, if you were born without Down Syndrome...you won't get much out of his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	102	4	4	3	287645	5/17/06	i think he likes to hear himself talk...either way its a very easy class if you make changes from your drafts to the final...papers really dont have to be that well written to get a good grade

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	101	4	5	4	287645	1/26/06	He is one of the best professors at UB..he is so understandin and if u put like good ideas in ur paper u will get a good grade...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	101	4	5	3	287645	10/27/05	He is the perfect teacher for freshman, he doesn't give a crazy amount of work and his papers are easy. Just do the work and you will get at least a B
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	101	5	5	3	287645	2/2/05	Skipper dave is the man!I wasn't there half the time and managed to score a good grade. Just do your work and you should be all set.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	102	4	4	3	287645	1/18/07	for english he's a good guy to get for college english it can't get better then him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	102	4	5	3	287645	3/30/06	intresting guy. you can write about just about anything for your papers and he's a really nice guy. i can't believe that another english teacher is better. class is interesting and he's a good guy. papers while might be a tad long you can write on anything so its easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	102	4	4	4	287645	1/30/06	Skipper Dave is the man! The class is interesting and the work in minimal.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	101	4	4	4	287645	12/27/05	I know he'snotteaching it in the spring, but he's stillagood teacher to have. Easy, funny,he makes class fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	101102	4	5	3	287645	7/30/05	Best English teacher I ever had. He had great stories and teaches students the real way to write. As long as you make effort your guarnteed at least a B or UP. before i took his class i was scared of college english, but now I laugh and take my time when I have a paper Due lol lol lol
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David More	4.3	2	English	102	3	5		287645	4/27/04	Skipper Dave is a pretty cool teacher with some history behind him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Morris	3.2	1	English	102	4	3	2	1474532	10/21/12	A good teacher but focuses on Buffalo and nothing else. We did everything related to Buffalo
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Morris	3.2	2	English	102	4	4	4	1474532	1/18/12	The papers throughout the semester were fairly easy until it came time for the final when it became every difficult to understand exactly what he was looking for. What he said the assignment was and what he wanted were two different things, but over multiple drafts it was easier to adjust to address what he wanted. Overall it was a good experience.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	126	4	5	4	285755	11/29/07	Great Professor! If you take his class just know he does pay attention, i missed 3 classes and he asked everyday where I was. He is lets u redo hmwk if you dont get credit and will answer questions at the beginning. his jokes are corny but funny.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	126	4	5	2	285755	11/1/06	Best math teacher I have ever had. I love his teaching style. During Class he does many example problems that go right along with the homework. For test review, he gives you last semester's test with answer key so you get a good idea of what you personally need to work on for the test. He collects all homework which Helps on tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	148	2	5	3	285755	12/31/05	This class was great becasue Prof Moslow was so helpful. YOu can meet him in office hours schedule appointments whatever. He wants his students to do well. Nicest guy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	122	4	5	4	285755	10/8/05	great professor! Very Helpful, and hesso sweet! He's fair and very helpful. Do your homework, attend class, and you'll do fine! I definitely recommend him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	124	5	5	5	285755	4/21/05	Great Prof! Prepared me very well for Calculus - I'll be getting an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	131	4	5	3	285755	1/3/05	One of the best professors for Calculus. Take him if you can. Very helpful at Office Hours. Will make every effort to help you. He is a very fair professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	115	4	5		285755	4/8/04	There's no reason why you shouldn't get an A in his class if you do the homework. He's a nice guy, and tells jokes to make class more entertaining.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	126	2	5	3	285755	11/3/06	this can either be a really hard or really easy class. homework every class. tests and quizzes. attendance every day. need to come to every class and take notes. very detailed oriented. tests are fairly easy. need the book. very old school teacher, might get lost sometimes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	126	3	5	5	285755	4/30/06	I would recommend this professor to anyone. He was great, clear, and VERY helpful. He even had good jokes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	285755	10/31/05	One of my favorites at SUNY (I actually took a high school summer school course from him also). I graduated from SUNY many years ago, but still appreciate Mr. Moslow's wonderful course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	285755	9/6/05	The best Calc teacher I ever had. If you want to understand what you are doing and may need some help, take this class. He is always there for you if you have questions and is always willing to help. Plus I loved his grading policy. Such a sweet teache
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	2	Mathematics	124	3	5	3	285755	4/11/05	Every class is the same routine, which can get boring. He is very helpful with questions. Not a bad teacher at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arthur Moslow	4.6	0	Mathematics	131	3	1	4	285755	11/23/04	Asks to simplify to a greater extent than others, a lot of homework (3-5 hrs unless you cheat with ans book bought separate), 40 mins going over hw & an hr for lesson, gives a review test for you to take home a week before, tests require full 2 hrs-having a graphin calc helps a lot.not my kinda prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	344	3	5	4	594297	1/31/11	Professor Moynihan is a great teacher who knows her material very well. The class was interesting but heavy on the reading. The one negative thing I have to say is that she says "um" "uh" and "you know" constantly. It's very distracting. I counted 58 times in less than 5 minutes of class. Still, a good teacher overall, very accommodating and kind.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	1	English	273	4	3	1	594297	4/28/10	she is really nice,and is always willing to give extensions on papers. There is A LOT of reading for her classes. she sometimes stumbles over her words and isnt sure what she is trying to say, but once she makes her point its worth it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	270	4	5	5	594297	3/2/08	Her texts and discussions are always spot on target, and they always keept me interested. She tries hard to engage the class, and generally succeeds at that. The reading can be a bit intense at times, but the other requirements for the class are rather tame. She's extremely accessible and always willing to help. Astounding professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	373	3	5	5	594297	4/28/05	For the most part the books for this class were really interesting. There were a lot of choices for the essay assignments. I would reccomend both the prof and class! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	270	5	5	3	594297	5/27/10	She is very willing to accommodate student's need. You need to read quite a few books, but they are fairly easy and short books. There is two papers due and a midterm and final. You will do real well if you keep up with the reading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	273	4	5	2	594297	4/9/10	Prof Moynihan is so nice! She's very understanding when it comes to absences,needing extensions, etc...Her papers are on interesting topics, and shes always got interesting viewpoints, yet she grades easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Susan Moynihan	4.4	2	English	280	4	4	4	594297	5/23/06	Kept getting the feeling she was frustrated with the apparently low intelligence of our class...it didn't help that she asks really vague discussion questions that no one can answer. Oh and if you're the only one who talks in class she'll make you feel bad about it. But the books she assigned were pretty good and overall it was pretty interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Muffoletto	5.0	2	Engineering	101	3	5	5	1590599	6/13/11	Awesome Guy! Never hesitate when you've got this guy as a professor or a TA for a class! You won't regret it believe me.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rae Muhlstock	4.8	2	English	201	4	5	5	1143478	5/19/11	Maybe one of the best teachers at UB. Makes writing fun and enjoyable. Teaching style is perfect for the course and always there to help. Allows one paper to be revised and regraded at the end of the semester. Take this class if you enjoy writing and even if you don't take it coz you will enjoy every single minute of this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rae Muhlstock	4.8	2	English	101	5	5	4	1143478	3/9/09	She is tooooooo much!! I totally recommend her! Every paper can be resubmitted. Her lectures are really interesting. She tries to keep everyone awake and it totally works! BEST ENGLISH PROF. very very very very helpful!! you'll always look forward to attending class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rae Muhlstock	4.8	2	English	101	1	5	1	1143478	12/17/10	She is a great teacher - she made me pay attention in class - a miracle. Her class was hard, but way worth it. I hate when instructors are mean & intimidating because it makes the course that much less enjoyable. You dont have to worry about that in Rae's class though... she KNOWS her stuff, and is approachable & even stylish too. I recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rae Muhlstock	4.8	2	English	101	3	5	3	1143478	11/18/08	She is so sweet..she really is prolly the best english i could have had..im getting her again for next semester becuz i enjoyed her so much..she grades kinda hard but you can resubmit everything..im doing really good and i do recommend her! i think you can miss like 3 classes or something and it wont count against you..but i enjoyed her a ton!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alok Mukherjee	4.8	2	Physics	151	4	5	2	1704786	10/20/12	Alok is the best T.A. I've had so far as an undergraduate. He made lab enjoyable! He explains difficult concepts well and in a way that makes them understandable. He also made himself available outside his office hours if anyone needed help before the exams or with lab reports. Alok really is a great T.A. and if you get the chance take him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alok Mukherjee	4.8	2	Physics	101	3	5	5	1704786	8/3/12	Alok is one the BEST TAs I've ever had. He's very helpful. He actually explains whatever you need to know in patiently, n is always there to help students. I like his personality. Totally he's a great guy! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alok Mukherjee	4.8	2	Physics	151	5	5	5	1704786	8/28/12	He knows what he teaches. If you are asking who you want to take PHY 151 class with, he would be the first choice. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alok Mukherjee	4.8	2	Physics	101	4	4	4	1704786	5/15/12	Alok is very helpful and he dumbs-down concepts so that anyone can understand physics. Overall a great TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	3	3	1	750810	4/29/10	Mullins was a statistics teaching machine. Pretty straightforward dude, strict in class. Pushups for extra credit was a plus though. Personally I hate stats so take it for what it is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	5	5	1	750810	4/8/09	Very good teacher. Made stats easy. Reading text book and doing homework is a must. Gives a lot of extra credit and other incentives for going to class. Tests are easy. VERY helpful in office hours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	4	3	1	750810	5/1/08	Ok so, if you've ever taken any college level math, this should be a piece of cake. Adam is anal about a few things but it isn't a big deal and is an overall help if you do what he said. My only problem was that overall I got a 92 and the cut off for an A is 93. No curve. In any other class that would have been an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	2	4	2	750810	1/31/08	He's a straight forward professor. If you complain about this class it's because you're a pansy who's gonna &i+ch about everything for the rest of your life, get over it and start growing up.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	1	Psychology	207	1	3	1	750810	12/2/05	This is his first year teaching and he wants to do everything by the book. Difficult exams, but he helps you with HW which he grades VERY anally (takes points off if you don't show charts and every single step you made). If you don't get perfect scores on all the HW and 91% on all 4 exams, you're not getting an A. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	1	Psychology	207	2	3	1	750810	11/8/05	Okay teacher but tests are very difficult and long, and he makes you feel sort of stupid when you ask for help, like you should know the stuff
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	322	4	5	5	750810	12/8/09	Great teacher, interesting, funny, attractive, knows his stuff
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	322	3	4	3	750810	12/2/08	class is fun, Fun to look at and Everything is explained well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	2	5	1	750810	4/28/08	Nice guy, good teacher, cared about how we did. Not enough time to take tests, we forced to rush at the end. Made sure we understood everything step by step before moving on, good teacher to bad it was for crappy statistics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	0	Psychology	207	1	2	4	750810	1/25/06	Can't teach period. Seemed more nervous than a virgin in a **** house. Totally unreasonable tests (4 term tests, and each was 2.5 hours long). Each test was like taking a final exam. Hard friggin multiple choice questions. It's damn near impossible to get an A in this guy's class. Way too anal, doesn't understand what it means to be a prof.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adam Mullins	3.8	2	Psychology	207	2	3	3	750810	11/18/05	he's good at teaching the material, what sucks is that the tests are really hard. He does make you feel kind of stupid if u dont kno the answer to the question. But other than that, i think he's an okay teacher to take.. better than most stats teachers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Murkin	3.0	0	Chemistry	312	2	2	4	1521324	5/7/12	lots of work for this class; surprise quizzes; 4 midterms; homework. lectures are sort of helpful. exams follow textbook and lecture notes. homework is not easxy, but not too bad. lol, this class is crazy for only 3 credits.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Murkin	3.0	2	Chemistry	501	2	5	4	1521324	4/10/11	Course is not easy but notes are good. Textbook is not very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Murkin	3.0	2	Chemistry	312	5	5	5	1521324	5/10/11	Murkin rocks!!!111
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Murphy	4.2	2	Physics	257	4	4	3	1049567	9/12/10	Makes it clear what he expects from you and if people aren't doing something properly in their reports he addresses the issue in lab. Easy to understand and nice enough. Would recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Murphy	4.2	2	Physics	107	5	4	4	1049567	5/2/08	Actually, he is Dr. Hu's TA. He is nice and the information is easy. Therefore, everyone can understand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Morh	3.8	2	Finance	301	4	4	4	1399430	1/13/12	As long as you keep up from the beginning this class should be no problem at all. Professor Morh is definitely not trying to trick anyone. Get your HW done early so you can go to office hours if you are confused...he doesn't give away answers but definitely helps you understand. I really liked the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Morh	3.8	2	Finance	301	3	4	3	1399430	4/8/11	He is a really nice guy and is down to help anyone who needs it. I would say the tests are fair but sometimes hard if you don't study hard. I liked him and got my only A in my junior year(finance). I would recommend him for mgf301 no doubt.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Morh	3.8	2	Finance	301	4	5	3	1399430	10/22/11	Interesting class, fair tests, fair homework, made sure you'd get a FAQ sheet for it so you didn't have to go to his overcrowded TA's hours. He wasn't bad at explaining stuff either.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Derek Morh	3.8	1	Finance	301	3	3	3	1399430	12/5/10	He is very smart in his field but not good at teaching. but he is a really nice person.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	5	1187425	2/15/11	Useless to attend class. She is terribly dull & rambles on about her nearly irrelevant research. The majority of the class just had their own conversations instead of listening to her lecture, as well, which makes it difficult to even listen in the first place. If you get a decent TA though, & keep up with the reading, you should turn out okay.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	0	Chemistry	101	5	1	1	1187425	12/15/10	She is awful. Boring. Did not learn anything from her, learned most of what I know from the online homework (masteringchemistry) and rec/lab TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	0	Chemistry	101	3	1	4	1187425	11/18/10	Avoid this professor. She's horrible, hard to understand sometimes, and she's downright boring. Sign up for Atwood, he's by far the best CHE 101 professor. Also, if you can't get into his class, you can just attend his class anyways. You don't have to go to the CHE 101 lecture you signed up for because they all teach the same thing. ATWOOD FTW
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	2	Chemistry	101	5	3	3	1187425	12/1/08	her notes are right to the point and she shows you what to do for everything. the only bad thing about her is that she kinda sounds like a man. other than that i recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	0	Chemistry	101	2	2	3	1187425	11/11/08	She is terrible. Weird accent
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	0	Chemistry	101	3	1	1	1187425	1/17/11	The lectures were useless and utterly boring. You are better off glancing at the chapters in the book and you will do a lot better. Your grade depends on how well your TA goes over the material and i had a great one. Overall not too great of a teacher just make sure to ask questions in the recitations
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	1	Chemistry	102	4	3	3	1187425	11/27/10	She would be a better teacher if she would just cut to the point of what we need to know. She usually just rambles on and on about pointless examples causing no one to go to class. I've heard that Atwood is better. She isn't horrible, but you can get the same information from the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	1	Chemistry	101	2	3	3	1187425	10/26/10	I learned nothing at all during lecture, that is if I went to it. I would usually just read the book which is way better than trying to learn anything from her. I usually just sat in class and talked or listened to music. The graded homework questions are all on google too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	4	1187425	11/20/08	Good professor :] .. go to class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Janet Morrow	2.5	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	3	1187425	10/22/08	Easy to understand and worth going to class! Really nice.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gilberto Mosqueda	3.3	2	Engineering	209	3	4	4	899960	3/30/08	He's a nice guy, and explains the material well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	3	5	4	1077898	3/17/10	Great professor. Very helpful. Lots of intelligent reading. Helpful even the semester after class was taken. Recommend strongly this professor. Very much reachable. Destined to be a great professor at a top notch school!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	3	5	5	1077898	10/24/09	VERY approachable and objective. Will literally answer as many questions as the class has, and will even give a review sheet for the test and accept email questions (I sent 14/14 answers for his short answer portion & he looked at em all on a Saturday!) and respond via email before the test. Actually cares about students, posts jobs. + nice threadz
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	4	5	4	1077898	4/27/09	Great teacher and easy class if you do the reading. Truly cares about his students. Prior entries that say he is a bad teacher that did not care about his students was certainly in the wrong class. Quizzes are easy, and he's very objective. Just be prepared to learn a lot about Islam; I loved the class but I wish it was less theologically focused.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	3	5	5	1077898	11/5/08	Great teacher, your lucky if you are able to take the class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	0	Political Science	430	1	1	1	1077898	7/23/08	bad bad bad
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	430	3	5	5	1077898	5/1/08	Nicest & most respectful professor I have ever had. Really wants to see & help his students succeed. Follows the syllabi exactly. Two tests and one 15 page research paper, review sheet for test-only covers the information from the sheet & gives the essays. Very intelligent, very informed and passionate about the topic. Would love to have him again!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	3	4	2	1077898	12/29/09	Wow! I took this class to fill an elective. I learned so much. His system is kind of intense lots of reading, but in the end you know a TON about the middle east. I highly doubt he will remain at UB, he is bound for greatness as a professor. Take his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	420	3	5	5	1077898	8/1/09	Best poli sci teacher, extremely helpful, interesting etc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	371	4	4	5	1077898	1/28/09	Great teacher. If you do the reading you will be well off. if you can take this class with him I would highly recommend it. he really knows his stuff and handles a very controversial subject well. he asked if we thought readings and tests were reasonable and adjusted some things accordingly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	0	Political Science	430	1	1	4	1077898	8/26/08	horrible not so nice as he seems not as says he will help u but pays no mind completly forgets about his students has favorites once he doesnt like u he doesnt like u for all ur classes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	430	4	5	4	1077898	7/14/08	Absolutely fantastic, cares about his students and wants them to succeed both in the classroom and in their lives afterwords. Always available to help explain things more or just to talk. Highly recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Fait Muedini	4.2	2	Political Science	335	4	5	5	1077898	12/17/07	He cares about his students. He lets his students run class discussions, which get out of control sometimes but overall contributes to the valor of the class.Learned a lot about Foreign Policy I look forward to having him for Human Rights.Requires a lot of reading and gave lots of quizzes which sucked but he is still one of the best. RECOMMENDED!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Mugavero	4.3	2	English	242	3	4	5	1290741	3/28/13	As an English major, I tend to be very attached to my English professors. Nick is very easy to form a relationship with. He loves to talk and sometimes gets off topic, but everything he says is interesting and somehow valuable. He obviously knows a lot about his material. He's also an incredibly fair grader and doesn't assign crazy amounts of work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Mugavero	4.3	2	English	201	2	5	4	1290741	3/24/10	There is no reason not to take him. He is of tremendou help. If you want to actually learn, make use of your intellect and be a good writer, he's the best option (that I know of). He's down to earth and students are always welcome if they need his help! You'll have no regrets,You have to be prepared. I worked really hard and earned(not got) an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Mugavero	4.3	2	English	201	5	4	4	1290741	5/27/09	pretty laid back guy, likes to talk a lot. He eliminated one essay because he couldn't keep up with the syllabus. In total we wrote three essays including a 6-8 page research paper. Overall he is a nice guy but an OK teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Mugavero	4.3	2	English	102	4	3	4	1290741	11/7/10	Definitely a nice guy, extremely laid back and understanding. He tends to fall behind the syllabus but his assignments are reasonable and he is a fair grader. His discussions in class are very thought-provoking, although he does tend to ramble on and get off track occasionally. He's worth picking as your teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Mugavero	4.3	2	English	207	3	5	5	1290741	12/2/09	class was always very interesting. thought-provoking discussions & interested in students thoughts. GET THE BEDFORD RESEARCHER! i didn't buy it cuz it was for the 7-10 pg. research paper & it was a mistake, i didn't know how 2 cite in the correct format & that counts toward the grade! tough grader. make sure you like/are good at writing! no final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leah Muir	4.5	2	Music	401402	2	5	5	548419	8/31/05	a little flighty, but a great teacher that has absolutely no issue with helping on her own time and pulling trix out of her bag... Easy A as long as you fulfill the terms of the assignment....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leah Muir	4.5	2	Music	401	4	5	5	548419	1/5/05	good class

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Muldoon	3.7	2	Accounting	202	3	5		231040	7/16/03	She's a cutie! And the recitation was helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorrie Muldoon	3.7	2	Accounting	202	4	5		231040	3/29/04	She is awesome. Very nice and very helpful with the material, makes it much easier to understand than the lecture does. She rules!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dalia Muller	4.5	2	History	112	5	3	4	1267414	3/28/13	Her lectures are a little bit boring, but her notes are very clear, and her tests are very fair. Aside from the tests, she just assigns a few short papers and pop quizzes, to encourage attendence. As long as you take notes, you'll do well. She reccommends you read the book, but it's really only necessary when you're going to write a paper.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dalia Muller	4.5	2	History	420	2	5	4	1267414	12/9/09	Pretty attractive compared to most teachers. Requires alot of reading, and discussion. makes students lead the discussion. Easy grader on essays.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dalia Muller	4.5	2	History	112	3	4	3	1267414	3/21/13	Weekly readings required to keep up with recitations. Pop lecture quizzes to ensure attendance. Three 2-3 page essays. Two intensive exams (easy if you know the material).If you have other subjects to deeply worry about, I dont recommend her class because of the amount of work. However, I love her topics: slavery, conquests, colonialism, WWs, etc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Manuel Jesus Munoz Merchan	5.0	2	Languages	152	4	5	5	1711547	4/18/12	Great professor, always makes class interesting and teaches us the slang as well as formal Spanish.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jon Murphy	5.0	2	English	101	2	5	3	736224	10/25/05	Great professor. I just took this class as a free credit, but he has gotten me really interested in English. I recommend him to anyone
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Murray	5.0	2	Architecture	145	5	5	5	851925	12/5/11	Prof. Murray changed my mind and made me want to go to law school. He takes material that sounds horribly boring (zoning law) and makes it interesting by making it relevant to current events. Tests are open book and he gives you his PPTs, there's really no way you shouldn't get a good grade. Easy class but I also learned a lot - awesome professor!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Muscarella	4.7	2	Athletics	299	5	5	3	1301976	5/10/12	Very easy class with mandatory attendance and one final paper with weekly assignments. Easy A and gpa booster.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Muscarella	4.7	2	Athletics	299	5	5	3	1301976	12/22/11	So so SO easy. You get weekly assignments that take you at most ten minutes to do. You only get 2 absences for the semester until your grade gets docked. You will get out early. Guaranteed. My hour and a half class was usually over in about 40 minutes, sometimes an hour, and sometimes 20 minutes. He's never on time so you can be a little late
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Muscarella	4.7	2	Athletics	101	5	5	5	1301976	7/17/09	so so so easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Muscarella	4.7	2	Athletics	222	5	5	5	1301976	5/3/12	such an easy class. on average, 1 assignment a week that take you like seriously 5 minutes to type up. final paper and presentation- but its extremely easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Muscarella	4.7	2	Athletics	200	5	5	5	1301976	8/30/09	very easy class for athletes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athena Mutua	3.0	1	Law	1	3	3	2	1315268	4/6/12	Good for admin law. If you take good notes out of your reading and study for the final its an easy class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athena Mutua	3.0	1	Law	400	4	3	3	1315268	11/24/09	She's fine. She says "MRIGHT" after every sentence. Its sort of like taking corporations with Whoopie Goldberg, but not nearly as funny. I missed a lot of class, but read the textbook the week before the final and got an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	2	Engineering	320	2	4	5	625003	7/15/12	he is cool and helpful however, he makes the class difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	2	Engineering	320	3	3	4	625003	7/27/09	Weekly homework assignments are pretty difficult. Go to the TA for help every week. Tests are hard, but you can sort of predict what the questions will be. Make sure you do the homework and study the homework for exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	2	Engineering	521	4	3	3	625003	9/18/07	He is good as a profesor..

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	2	Engineering	320	3	5	4	625003	5/13/11	Great Professor!! Exams are hard, but if you go to him for help with the material before the exam & study the homework they are manageable. Homework is hard, but if you get help it prepares you for the exams and you end up learning a lot. Material is very applicable to everyday life & future employment. Overall best professor I had this semester!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	2	Engineering	505	3	5	5	625003	11/20/07	very good prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	1	Engineering	320	3	2	3	625003	4/29/07	Pretends to care about how we are doing in the class. Then he puts the hardest possible questions on his long exams. Homework can be tedious and you do a project. He dosnt tell you what do on the project or when its due until the day before.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rakesh Nagi	3.3	0	Engineering	320	2	1	4	625003	5/24/05	He comes off as a pretty cool guy who truly wants everyone in his class to do well and pretends to care if they don't, but he never made changes so the class did better, and his tests were rather long do take in a 50 min period and he even admitted it. So even though it seems like an easy class with a good professor watch out bc i can get ugly fast
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Yunju Nam	3.0	1	Social Work	510	4	3	3	1469679	11/15/10	Teacher is newer and hard to understand sometimes. If you show up and show an interest you will pass. Very approachable, but doesn't always yield results. Overall not horrible, but difinitely not the best.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	108	5	5	5	150407	12/11/11	Easily my favorite class of my first semester. Down to Earth guy. This is more than an acting class, it is a study of life as well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	108	4	5	3	150407	11/19/07	Great professor, great guy A must take class for anyone thinking about acting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	109	3	5	5	150407	10/24/06	Pretty Much, Greg is the best professor there is. He doesnt teach to ridged standards, but teaches with feeling, and passion. He treats us like adults, and gives us things to think about in life that are actually important, and mean something to us personally. not only that, but hes really fun! GREG IS THE MAN
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	108	4	5	5	150407	1/18/06	amazing teacher, forces students to think for themselves

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	109	4	5	5	150407	5/9/05	As Vincent O'Neill once told me, Greg is one of the best acting teachers at UB. He'll push you the hardest and he cares the most.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Greg Natale	4.2	2	Theater	109	5	5	5	150407	7/17/06	I wish I would have taken the course earlier in my academic career. I would have seriously thought of picking up acting as a minor. Very straightforward. Go to class, genually try, put forth the effort, and you will receive an A. Thanks Greg!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Nathan	4.5	2	History	395	5	5	5	1509738	4/17/12	Specialist in all things Buddhist and Korean. Fair courseload, understanding of students. Best professor I've taken at UB hands down.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Nathan	4.5	2	History	395	5	5	5	1509738	5/3/11	Great teacher, very interested in what he teaches and is not too heavy on the work. There's quite a bit of reading, but not all of it is usually necessary to do well in the class. Only a midterm and a final, one paper, and 15% of your grade is attendance and discussion board posts. Gives bonuses, very easy to approach. Take this guy for anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Nathan	4.5	2	History	000	4	4	3	1509738	1/30/12	Knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Nathan	4.5	2	History	338	4	4	5	1509738	12/12/10	Great guy, very interested in the material and goes into it very in-depth. He's a Korean specialist, so having him for Korean History class was great. He was slow to give back tests and papers, but he was a lenient grader and bumped up our grades for taking a long time. No homework beyond reading. 2 papers for the the whole course and 2 tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	101	1	5	1	654748	8/17/10	'06: Foucault/Chomsky debate, Moore, Hamer & Davis, BigPharm, "pathologization" of women & minorities, + Navarre's stories of working at urban clinics, the WTO protests, the Cinti race riots. I thought, FREAK! & became an RN, BUT the MD's at MY clinic put EVERYONE on SSRI's; even the other RNs are Prozac zombies. 2+2=5? HA F*&% you anyway Navarre!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	2	654748	5/30/10	Yeah, I can see how gen-ed students find the demands kinda appalling. But for the serious and/or advanced student, Navarre's a revelation about the discipline, focus, and long-term commitment it takes to actually get to creative, innovative, independent thought. My chapbook's coming out this fall, and she's high on my list of dedications.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	5	654748	5/23/10	Okay, she really is a life-changing, witty, joyous prof, but don't take her unless you're willing to read read read and write write write, because she doesn't care if it's not your major or not your thing, and she takes no prisoners about attendance and so forth.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	5	654748	4/26/10	Staging and acting out the Sojourner Truth speeches was the BEST. You never knew WHAT was going to happen in Navarre's class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	5	654748	4/23/10	So nice to run into her; she's as funny, provactive & kind as ever. We had great talks back in the day about art, activism, textual & experiential learning, spirituality and challenge. She was right there once she saw I did the work. Taught me a lot about tacking actions to words
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	3	654748	4/22/10	I would never had read Frederick Douglass or seen those particular films or learned about the Trail of Tears except for her. Ridiculous amount of homework, but good material. Will make you participate in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	4	654748	2/19/10	Brilliant, funny, & hot
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	4	654748	1/2/10	This prof gives a great intro to American studies about the 19th century. I loved all the stuff about Native Americans, & wish there was more in regular classes. Navarre has a theatrical way of putting herself across, but she's a hardass about attendance & homeworks. You have to do the work all aong, or you won't pass even if your exams are A's.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	4	654748	12/22/09	Writing almost EVERY day & the stiffest attendance policy. I know some people who got A's and B's on the exams but still flunked b/c they didn't show or tun in enough assignments. That said, if you're there all the time & do the work,, the grading gets more generous along the way. Thio class was fun & worthwhile, but it's NOT a blow-off.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	4	654748	12/8/09	INCREDIBLE amoung of reading and writing for a gen-ed class. Attendenance WITH homework is TOTALLY required and there is no way out of that. Do NOT take her unless you want to learn a LOT about what's on the syllabus b/c you can't just slide by in the back. She totally busts people for cell phones, blackberries, desk-tops, or whatever.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	4	654748	7/5/10	I'm off to Starr King seminary in the fall. Who knew this angry disillusioned kid would end up moving towards the pulpit. Thanks Navarre for all the discussions and debates and challenges, and helping me see my own path.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	3	654748	5/25/10	Wow, she was so cool! Very insightful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	2	654748	5/16/10	Way stimulating, fun, and challenging. A lot of readings and homeworks, but good material and class interactions. Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy gen ed A - no way out of the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies		1	5	5	654748	4/24/10	I hated her b/c of some hard lessons: intellectual discipline (do the research, don't glom on to**** just b/c it sounds good/feels good) + accountability (if you make a mess, you clean it up and/or eat the consequences). Now that I'm out in the world, I get it. This woman walks her talk and motivated me to walk mine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	5	654748	4/22/10	Killer written exams. I mean, not impossible, just a lot of work. The earlier stuff is best: Native/Anglo-European American encounters, all the warfare, their speeches & histories. Man oh man.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	4	654748	2/20/10	Totally in a good mood all the time. Will kick ass when needed. Lectures and discussions are eye-opening & well-worth attendance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	1	5	4	654748	1/4/10	Navarre will OWN ALL YOUR TIME with copious reading and writing. It's a big class, but she will NOT spoon-feed, so you have to sit in front & listen or lose. BEWARE because her classes are as heavy as upper level classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	5	654748	12/27/09	She's a very fun teacher who's heavily attendance and homeworks. She does a lot of group work with writngs on the board. Take-home exams from discussions in class. Overall a positrive class but be prepared for a ton of reading and writing all the way through.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	5	654748	12/15/09	Navarre is a great prof to take for a gen-ed class. She covers a lot of material and you have to do a lot of reading and writing, but if you're steady about it, the effor pays off. Great films and interesting little bits of fictions and history. She's not bad on the eyes, either, if you like the whole hippie-chick thing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	5	654748	12/5/09	Dr. Navarre is generous with praise AND criticism. She has a sense of humor about herself, but she notices EVERYTHING about everyone. As long as you're there and doing the work she's there and will work with you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	3	654748	12/4/09	I will actually miss this class! We look at so many different kinds of things, and then she draws it together. There are a LOT of homeworks and reading assignments and watching things. It's funny to watch her deal with class dynamics with so many people. Nobody really gets away with anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	3	654748	9/23/09	Cool stuff. Variety of material. Knows her way around it. Tough on homeworks but clarifies when asked. Perstnckety but approachable. You have to pay attn to assignments thoough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	385	2	5	5	654748	5/27/09	Spring of '07. Good class. Great to see she's still out there kicking ass and taking names!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	385	2	5	5	654748	5/27/09	Back in 06. Was just reminded of this, watching Navarre skewering somebody on a list-serv. She is totally intolerant of ****. Refreshing. Interesting material. Be prepared to work
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	107	4	4	1	654748	3/29/06	fairly straighforward class; WAY too much work for what most ppl take for a gen-ed. but if you dont mind reading a ton of bad books, and sitting in a circle and having a hippy tell you what she thinks about them, take this class. its pretty easy.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	211	2	5	5	654748	11/16/09	This teacher comes out with interesting insuights I wouldn't have thought of. The reading and writing load have been heavy but there are periods where she lets up. We've seen some folks drop, and she's made it clear you have to be there, and be working steadily. This subject Not my favorite -- I'm a busines major -- but I'm glad I took this gen
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	385	2	5	5	654748	5/28/09	Rock on Professor Navarre!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	385	2	5	5	654748	5/27/09	Saw the thread. Had this class in '07. Very good teacher who will NOT take**** off anyone. No one should take AMS classes thinking they can just run political stuff at the mouth and pass. VERY challenging material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	385	2	5	4	654748	5/27/09	Great - a combo of captivity and slave narratives around cross-cultural attitudes about warfare. Some were not reading though & just copped politico attitudes -- hope those motherf--ers flunked! The rest of us had to write write write when no one would talk. ****load of work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	107	3	4	3	654748	10/24/05	This class is a lot of work, but her grading is not that harsh. There are readings due each class along with 1 page written responses (on average). There is also a 30 minute group class presentation with a 5 page paper (per person) attached to that. There is also a 7 page research paper. You also have to read a novel. So yeah, a lot of work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Evelyn Navarre	4.9	2	American Studies	376	5	5	5	654748	9/9/05	I LOVE HER!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shadi Nazarian	1.0	0	Architecture	202	1	1	1	834910	8/14/06	Very difficult. Frequently make suggestions one class and then changes her mind the next. EXTREMELY CONFUSING! No one had any idea what she was talking about the entire semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shadi Nazarian	1.0	0	Architecture		2	1	5	834910	4/19/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shadi Nazarian	1.0	0	Architecture	202	1	1	5	834910	7/1/06	Ohh my God, when it comes to this professor this is the worst professor excisting in mankind. She says words that are not even listed in the dictionary and sometimes you think how she got this job. Dont recommend her to anybody.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christine Nelson	5.0	2	Nursing	373	5	5	5	898026	6/11/08	the best female professor in the world. took her for summer ABS nursing and i would never have wanted any other way. together with Dr erdley, they are the dynamic duo. understood the class beautifully
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	4	3	288320	11/26/12	Passionate and knowledgeable about his course material, but the course is kind of a pain. The project is time consuming as are the Access homeworks. Tests are a little bit tricky too, like Ray O make sure you watch the lecture since he asks questions about it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	1	Business	351	3	2	3	288320	12/20/11	Class wasn't particularly difficult but instructors would take away points any chance they could in a class where you could make few mistakes. Tests could be tricky. Never choose Sara Macie as a TA, she won't help you and grades you extremely hard on your homework and final project, STAY AWAY
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business		3	2	2	288320	11/15/11	If you are not interested in the class you will do poorly unless you are smart to begin with. Average students may struggle with the class. 5 homeworks that are due. they are graded on how well you do they. I never received a grade above an 80% on the hw. takes questions from practice tests and rewords them to give you different answers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	0	Business	351	3	1	4	288320	10/11/11	No doubt this guy knnows a lot about computers, but nothing about teaching a class or writing exams. All questions are vague, scattered,and poorly phrased. Not to mention his useless TA's (mine at least). A huge waste of a 4 credit class. Too bad, because I was genuinely interested in the material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	0	Business	351	1	2	1	288320	7/28/11	He looks like good, but I don't think he is. Please remember HE is NOT fair at all. Also, really hard to get an A. Exam is hard and his grading scale is way too hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	2	5	2	288320	1/7/11	Murray's a really nice guy, however his class grading scale is way too hard to receive a better than average grade in. It's almost impossible to receive anywhere near an A or A- if you lose even 10-15 points in the class. Also, like someone mentioned below, DO NOT CHOOSE SARAH MACIE AS YOUR T.A. She constantly whines and grades much you harder.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	2	5	3	288320	12/14/10	Murray is the best. Such a nice guy, also very helpful. He had to deal with a copy of the test getting passed around and still stayed cool. I would take another class with him in an instant; however, the Access material in this class was hard. I hate how ub combines microsoft office clases with other material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	3	4	288320	12/17/09	Not too hard. Homeworks can take a while but are listed step by step in the workbook. Test were easy you can probably get away with an A or B just cramming the night before
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	2	5	3	288320	9/3/09	A very nice teacher. I went to class a lot just because it's a very long lecture to have to sit and watch on the comp..and you have to take very good notes. HWs took FOREVER sometimes so start early. Tests weren't too bad, but they weren't necessarily easy. Group project wasn't that bad either..i got a B+ but had to work hard for it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	3	4	2	288320	3/15/09	The class is quite alot of work compared to others. You have 5 long homework assignments, and one group project. They are all quite time consuming. The worst are the exams though, you have 3, and they are all pretty tough. Alot of memorization and nitpicking facts. If you can remember abbriavtions and computer code you will probably love this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	3	4	5	288320	3/8/12	Tests are somewhat difficult. Make sure you write down everything in lectures including his analogies. The project is a pain but not difficult. Class material is not the most interesting but he is passionate about what he teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	2	5	4	288320	11/22/11	This is a difficult class, no doubt about that but Professor Murray is always there to help! He is a wonderful teacher and really cares about his students. If he was not the prof of this class I would have been miserable! One of my fav profs!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	0	Business	351	1	1	4	288320	10/13/11	I completely agree. He knows what he is talking about but he is an AWFUL teacher. I too was interested in this material too prior to the start of the class but now i genuinely hate this material with a passion. Unfortunately like everything in the SOM this class it's mandatory, it's online and there is only one professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	5	4	288320	8/2/11	Great professor, very helpful. Its an online course, with a weekly recitation taught by one of several TA's. Tests aren't bad, he puts up practice questions on UBLearns which are extremely close to the real test. One semester-long project, hope for a good team and it should be easy to get at least a B.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	5	5	1	288320	1/12/11	Professor Murray is extremely nice and super helpful. His tests weren't too bad. Make sure to use the review sheets! I disagree that Sara Macie is a terrible TA. She was very helpful to me in her office hours and helped me with all my homework issues. She even gave me an extension once when I was having computer issues!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	314	5	5	4	288320	12/28/10	Great guy, great teacher. The best in the MSS department hands down
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	1	Business	351	4	2	3	288320	12/5/10	He is okay in his teaching but his exams are more advanced then his teaching skills.He has to realize that. Other then that, he is really nice. Do not TAKE TA as Sara Macie. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER !
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	5	5	288320	12/15/09	My favorite professor at UB!! I enjoyed watching the lectures. I LEARNED SO MUCH. The tests are a little difficult but if you watch the lectures and take notes, the exam seems almost easy. Plus he is a SUPER NICE teacher that is extremely helpful. Make sure to start your HW's and project early. With a fair amount of work, an A is easily attainable
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	1	Business	351	3	2	2	288320	8/3/09	The exams range from useless trivia (such as "what prominent computer security hazard occurred in 1987?") to gotcha questions designed to validate the professor's ego as an instructor, asking things like "What did I say about my wife in lecture 4?" to make sure you are watching lectures. You learn a bit from the homework, the rest is just noise.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	5	5	5	288320	8/8/08	He's the best professor I've had in ub. very very helpful, really nice. should take this class if u have the chance. Exams based on notes. tells you what's important. HW takes time but extremely easy. GET A GOOD GROUP for the project. Start your hw early cuz u never know how much time you'll need for it.other than that, Enjoy. can be an easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	5	5	3	288320	3/18/08	This class is easy, I have no idea what these other people are talking about, he's also super nice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	0	Business	351	1	2	1	288320	12/7/07	The homeworks take forever and the tests are hard too. I hate this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	5	2	288320	5/8/07	Class is lame. I thought the exams were kind of unfair compared to other classes for the amount of time I put in studying. Still an easy A or B if you have a clue.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	5	5	5	288320	2/26/07	Great teacher, very nice (except for when people leave his class early without telling him) and the class is easy. You dont really need to buy the book fi you dont want to, its just helpful with in class excercises (which are soooo easy).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	2	5	1	288320	9/13/06	Class sucks, its amazing how pointless this 4 credit class is, (compares with mgq 201's irrelevant material) also the hw takes some time and its about nothing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	4	4	3	288320	12/17/05	easy class. only thing i did not like was how he takes attendence, which counts, randomly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	5	3	288320	4/23/05	Pretty good, I Love not having to go to class. Tests are easy if you study a little and watch the videos. He is also pretty interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	1	5	4	288320	11/4/04	Kind of a computer nerd, but real nice guy, helps you if you need it, but you really don't in this class. Extremely easy, all notes are online, and tests are based off of notes. Don't bother buying the book!!! Its 100 bucks and I didnt open it once and got an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	4	5	288320	9/17/04	is the classic computer geek. i was nervous about him taking attendance every now and then because it counts so i just left early often. the t.a. knew very little about computers though but looked good
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	4	5		288320	3/30/04	He's a good teacher. He sticks to the plan and is completely fair about everything. If you have to take this course definately get this professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	5	5	2	288320	12/30/07	I thought the class was pretty easy. Many of the tests he tells you the main points. He also drops one exam. The final project isnt hard either. Also he changes the grading scale depending on the class averages.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	3	5	2	288320	11/17/07	The lectures are extremely boring and most of the material for the exams are theoretical which sucks. I spent hours studying for it and still am doing bad on the exams. The only plus side is that he is really nice, but class still sucks regardless
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	5	3	5	288320	5/3/07	Easy class/material
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	5	3	288320	12/19/06	Great teacher. Loves what he does and is incredibly helpful if you go talk to him. Class itself is a little boring, but you will actually use this material in the real world, so it isn't all bad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	5	5	3	288320	1/22/06	He's a great teacher, and the course is super easy. The random attendance grades kinda suck, but the material is easy, and the tests are easy too. Print off all the notes and take them to class, and I would recommend not even buying the textbook - I got an A, and I didn't open the book once. And, you drop your worst test, so you can skip the final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	5	5	5	288320	11/12/05	Great guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	3	4	288320	4/14/05	some what of an easy class if you know anything about computers, didn't buy the book but some might need it. labs are crazy easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	4	4	3	288320	10/31/04	Don't need to go to class at all with this guy. Just need to attend his Exam Review in which he gives you whatever you need to know for the exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	150	4	4		288320	8/4/04	He takes attendance every once a while without students knowing it. And it counts toward final grade for the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	5	4		288320	3/29/04	He's your classic computer nerd, but he's really easy to understand and the class is very easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Murray	4.2	2	Business	351	3	4		288320	11/16/03	He's really dorky, but the class was alright and the exams were fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sandra Murry	2.5	1	Psychology	413	1	2	1	1134965	5/10/08	Might be smart, but she has no idea how to teach. Picked favorites, too. Typical class where you and your grade don't matter to the professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics	151	5	5	5	779342	3/15/10	Best professor I've had at UB. I looked forward to Medical Terminology daily. She's very knowledgeable and funny, a combination that makes CL151 fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics	151	5	5	5	779342	12/29/07	Fun class even though there's weekly quizzes,hw and 1 10 min presentation on any med condition you want. You'll def learn a lot and it'll be very helpful in other classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics	112	3	3	4	779342	4/2/07	um Jenny is kinda shady. She's cancelled recitation twice on us, once before a test. Her facts are always the same as Boyd's lectures and sometimes she says the complete opposite of what he said. I've never seen her in lecture so i don't know if she actually goes but she's never in class to take our tests at the end. She kinda creeps me out.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics		3	4	3	779342	12/13/05	Ms. Muslin kind of scares me. Sometimes I can't tell if she likes me or not. I think she might discuss me with her friends outside of class - another teacher told me that I was like a fragile little bird with a washcloth... he wouldn't lie to me about that!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics	151	2	5	4	779342	6/27/09	Jenny Muslin is a natural and a great teacher. She really knows her material, which is weird because this is a medical terminology class but she is an archeologist. She is very helpful and funny. She made a potentially boring class not-boring, even fun!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics		3	5	3	779342	4/20/07	she gives you everything you need to pass th class. if you go to her recitation you will always get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Muslin	4.7	2	Classics	111	3	5	5	779342	11/28/06	Jenny is awesome. I would think she was a good teacher even if I didn't have a crush on her. Her sense of humor makes the class go by quickly and easly
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nader Nader	3.0	1	Medicine	240	3	3	3	1039408	10/17/07	He is a smart guy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jeongsub Nam	5.0	2	English	211	3	5	4	598822	6/6/05	Really nice guy, will go out of his way to help and very easy to approach. Class was fun, he had a lot of personal stories and is definitely educated in Korean history. Class is mainly discussions based on readings, occasionally there's a movie or cultural event. He's a hard grader, but as long as you actually read the material you'll do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry	319	4	5	4	262988	12/20/11	One of the nicest professors I've ever had. Very understanding and reasonable guy. Lectures are a bit boring, but the tests and quizzes are fair, and there is no mandatory homework. I'd recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry	319	3	5	5	262988	1/27/09	Excellent Professor. Very good judgement in P.Chem textbooks for students and in lecture topics covered (core plus more). Although older now, this fine physical chemist and scientist is an enormous reservoir of "classical" P. Chem Knowledge with British humor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry	319	1	4	1	262988	3/6/07	Terrible class. He should retire. He is too old to teach. The class is so boring!!! Bring some coffee with you if you want to stay awake. To tell you the truth I didn't learn anything in his class and still passed. I think the class was not so hard, it's just that I didn't study at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	1	Chemistry	319	3	3	4	262988	12/10/05	.......I don't think he is as good as people said. I went to every lectures, but seems no one understand what he was talking about in the class. He kept jumping the topics and confused us. TONS of homeworks (I HATE THE HOMEWORKS!). The exam average was 40 something out of 100. But he does curve. Besides these, he is a really nice professors.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry		3	5		262988	10/16/03	One of the BEST professors I have EVER HAD! I will never forget him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry	319	4	5	4	262988	8/31/10	nice professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	0	Chemistry	319	2	2	3	262988	1/4/09	Pleasant fellow, and definitely will help you out. First day of class he said he wanted to help students get over their fears of PChem. Unfortunately, he did not succeed, at least not for my class. Problem sets more often than not contained errors that you wouldn't know about unless you went to office hours. Exams and quizzes were very hard too
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	1	Chemistry	319	3	4	4	262988	12/31/05	The class itself is very difficult and boring. He supposedly curves, but doesnt tell you how you are doing in class during the semester. A 70 on an exam can mean a C or an A. He is very helpful during the office hours with regards to the class material. However fails to reply back in emails when it comes to discussing grades.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Nancollas	3.9	2	Chemistry		2	5	3	262988	10/9/05	Extreamly nice and pleasent British fellow! Not only was he very willing to help, his help sessions and efforts were VERY helpful. Relatively difficult topic for chem, but he gives you every chance to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Nathan	4.5	2	English	101	4	5	3	890091	12/29/06	i got a C in high school and then now i have A+ average...enough said
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Nathan	4.5	2	English	101	4	5	4	890091	9/12/06	she is super cool...she even has us call her by her first name, she wants all her student to do well and it shows. shes a really great teacher and person. even though sometimes we get busy work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Natiella	4.5	2	Sociology	328	4	5	4	1570712	4/28/11	Amy Natiella is a great instructor. She's really nice and approachable and she isn't a very harsh grader. Her class was pretty simple and not difficult at all to get an A. I will definitely take another course with her given the chance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	2	1663868	2/24/13	Easiest A you could ever get! Go to class and study slides and you will do good. She does reviews prior to the exam and basically tells you what to remember.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	5	1663868	12/6/12	Best professor I ever have in UB. Look over the review sheets before taking the exam. It's based off the review sheet, easy A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	2	1663868	5/21/12	Great professor! Such a nice person!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	2	1663868	12/10/11	Sweet lady. Gives review of lectures before the exams, study that and if you don't get an A then LOL.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	303	5	5	3	1663868	12/17/12	Best teacher I had all semester. Very helpful during labs and with the final project if your confused. Very friendly, spent a lot of time talking to her before and after labs about pretty much anything. Did have a few errors with some grades, but corrected them when I asked her. She responds to questions via email very quickly. Don't buy the book!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	5	1663868	7/10/12	She is the best professor in the world! I really respect her so much
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Deborah Naybor	4.9	2	Geography	103	5	5	4	1663868	3/20/12	EASY EASY EASY. Does random simple quizzes for attendance at different times. All powerpoint, maybe a just a little from the book. Go to the review class and study her study guide and you'll great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Nell Trautner	4.9	2	Sociology	380	3	5	3	984363	4/8/11	Awesome teacher if you do the work you will get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Nell Trautner	4.9	2	Sociology	314	5	5	5	984363	6/10/08	Also took 373. By far my favorite professor at UB! She is a wonderful teacher and only wants the best for her students. Her tests are straightforward from her notes and readings,and she grades very fairly. Make sure to go to class, she takes attendance and gives quizzes randomly. I found the material very interesting and class is worth attending!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Nell Trautner	4.9	2	Sociology	314	4	4	4	984363	4/29/07	She is an awesome teacher. Go to class, because she gives unannounced quizzes and her classes are very interesting. Also, go to the review sessions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Nell Trautner	4.9	2	Sociology	314	3	5	4	984363	12/19/08	Awesome class, best professor. Really makes the material relevant and interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Nell Trautner	4.9	2	Sociology	314	4	5	5	984363	8/19/07	Incredible teacher. Class is veryy easy as long as you go (unannounced quizzes) and review classes are also very helpful. She makes the class fun, and surprisingly enough, you'll actually want to go!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Nelson	2.6	0	Business		5	1	1	269833	10/29/04	He is an example of a true young, struggling academic. He was hired on as a researcher, and true to the nature his teaching skills stink. He is there for one purpose: to get tenure as fast as possible and obtain income security. He cares mildly for his students and their learning.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Nelson	2.6	0	Business	601	3	1		269833	10/28/03	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Nelson	2.6	2	Business		3	4	3	269833	11/1/04	Prof. Nelson went out of his way to make the material clear and interesting. He did at times seem a little self-conscious, but this improved as the semester (Fall 2003) progressed. He presented the material logically and told very entertaining, relevant stories!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Nelson	2.6	1	Business	601	3	3		269833	11/23/03	This guy would be the coolest guy ever to drink beers with, but he projects absolutely no confidence in dealing with students. He likes to design strange "games" and play them in class. The upshot is he is very clear in his expectations which
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vasiliki Neofotistos	4.5	2	Anthropology	106	4	5	5	957226	12/14/10	Fun class, if not for some of the comments said by kids in class. has a bit of a thick greek accent, but she's more likely to misunderstand you, than you her. goes right through the textbook, and watch a movie once a week. uses remote clickers for attendance and questions. two midterms, a written assignment, and a final aren't too hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	314	3	4	4	984622	5/20/11	I honestly don't understand half the comments here. She is very approachable and gets things back in a timely matter. She is serious and willing to help. The course format is a little dry and redundant, though. She goes through lots of examples and if you come to class or go over the practice problems, you will be fine. It seems easier than it is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	0	Accounting	314	3	1	1	984622	1/11/10	I got a A- in the course, I dont know what else to say other than she might be the worst teacher in the Acc program right up there next to Jansma. I do agree with the other reviewers on how she comes off as sort of dumb. Ask her a question about the topic in a different manner and you will see what i mean. She cant do a problem w/o her notes. HAHA
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	305	2	4	1	984622	5/7/09	Tough class, tough teacher. Project is worth 25% and its simple. She does weekly quizzes but they are tough. The homework is easy. The final is based on one chapter.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	314	5	5	5	984622	5/4/09	Actually teaches, and speaks English as a first language. What more can you ask for?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	305	5	5	2	984622	12/16/07	This class could not be any easier. That said, she is very approachable, and is a very good teacher. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	314	2	4	4	984622	4/30/07	She loves to end class early, takes an average time to get back graded material (2 weeks)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	0	Accounting	314	3	1	1	984622	5/17/11	This was quite possibly the worst professor in the acc program here, she's useless. She also shows a clear bias towards certain students. I've never seen a professor teach like her. Be prepared to deal with a hypocritical teaching style where you won't actually learn anything but is extremely easy. seriously I learned more in Xu.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	0	Accounting	314	4	2	4	984622	11/10/09	Plays favorites in the class room. Although has many certifications comes across as unintelligent. As the man said below "Definitely a product of Western New York." Would not recommend her to anyone. She doesn't know how to stay organized or grade according to her own standards. Will give you whatever grade she wants by adjusting your attendance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	0	Accounting	314	5	1	1	984622	5/6/09	Terrible teacher. Goes on tangents about something that doesn't matter. Tells people they cant use laptops/cellphone in class and stops for 5 minutes wasting everyone time. Is not funny but tries really hard. Definitely a product of western new york.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	1	Accounting	314	3	2	4	984622	12/22/07	Althought this professor teaches pretty well when it comes down to her grading system...to put it lightly..it stinks...ig you put in enough effort for a B...she'll give you a B-...not justified
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Nesper	3.3	2	Accounting	314	4	5	5	984622	8/2/07	One of the better teachers, you will have. Takes time to get to know students. Very Approachable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	04371	2	4	2	562472	4/13/13	She's really nice and passionate about the subject BUT do not expect an A if you can't wow her. And she's really strict about MLA formatting/citations so just use the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	0	English	102	2	1	3	562472	4/20/08	I thought the class was awesome. She wasn't an easy teacher, but she was especially nice and helpful. As long as you did your work and tried, you did fine. It's a lot of work for a 100 level class but she was there to assist you when you needed it. I would take her again if I could.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	101	3	5	5	562472	1/10/07	This is definately not an easy class because there are tons of work. And the papers are really confusing at the beginning. Yea, she may be kind of weird and sort of hated because of what she says on the first day but not to call her miss or mrs, but she is a really nice and smart professor. She loves smart kids as well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	303	2	5	2	562472	10/26/06	I took the summer course (only like 6 weeks) so learning Chaucer in that amount of time was pretty hard, but you can tell she's really into what she's teaching and she tries her best to get you into it too. Crazy hard test, but I think she knew it was crazy hard, so she graded fairly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	1	English	101	2	3	1	562472	10/27/05	First day of class she said and I quote.. "Do not address me as Miss, Mrs, of Nestor but YOUR HIGHNESS!!" As you can see i dropped out of the class the first week. I hate professors who think they are high and mighty because they have read more literature than you. Teach don't preach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	303	2	5	1	562472	6/13/05	She dresses very unique. She's banging hott in her prurple stockings and gold shoes. Very nice lady, but class is very tough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	102	2	5	1	562472	4/19/05	do not take this class if you don't have to. she's very nice, i enjoyed some of her thoughts, etc, but she is sort of a tough grader and this class is far too much work for only being a 100 level class. her intentions are good though, if you're into writing and analysis this is a good class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	102	3	5	5	562472	6/4/08	Normal workload if you happen to be an English major, otherwise, the class may not be for you. Interesting texts, very understanding if you approached her with problems. Kind of eccentric, (but other academics may think she's "normal") ;) but very kind and knowledgeable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	102	1	5	2	562472	5/19/07	I've never written more papers in a semester, or probably in my life. But she loves what she's doing and will make extra time to help you if you're struggling with any of the papers. If you really want a challenge take her class, if not, there's easier ways out
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	0	English	201	1	2	2	562472	11/10/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	101	1	5	1	562472	11/18/05	She is a good professor, just be prepared to write out of your ass.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English		4	4	2	562472	10/5/05	very nice lady, a bit spacey, but very helpful. i found her very understanding when i had any trouble.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	102	2	5	3	562472	5/8/05	Nice teacher, very helpful with the assignments, but the workload seemed somewhat excessive for a GenEd/100-level class (lots of writing, peer review, etc). Also a very tough grader. I would recommend avoiding the class (due to the workload), if possible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Amy Nestor	3.9	2	English	102	2	4	3	562472	3/9/05	Tough course, a lot of writing, and she's a tough grader. However, she's willing to help you get better and works one-on-one with the students on research papers. Not too bad overall.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D T Newhouse	4.2	2	History	101	5	4	4	1235113	5/11/12	He was a chill young professor. Reading assignments were unnecessary because he went over all material in class the following day. Pop quizzes were ok but were replaced with exam grade(if higher). exams were pretty easy with similar quiz questions and short answer. Definitely an easy elective to take and was interesting as well. Good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D T Newhouse	4.2	2	History	112	4	4	1	1235113	5/11/09	He was my TA for UGC 112. Although, my professor was awful, he made it easier on us. He is easy going and very helpful!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jake Newsome	5.0	2	History	112	5	5	4	1743003	3/28/13	Jake is a great TA. He's really down to earth, and clearly knows a lot about the material he's presenting. He doesn't expect anything more than the professor does, as long as you attend his recitation and participate in discussion.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jake Newsome	5.0	2	History	112	5	5	5	1743003	8/22/12	He is an amazing TA!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	3	5	4	1509744	3/26/13	Hung is amazing. He keeps his lectures very interesting and has a great sense of humor. Large "assignments" were 50% and took a long time but were doable. Exams were tough but TA's graded generously. Not an easy class with anyone, but put the time in and you will get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	3	5	4	1509744	1/2/13	Great class! Dr. Ngo was a good lecturer, told jokes from time to time, and the material was definitely interesting! You don't have to go to class because he wrote an amazing blog with all of the material. I enjoyed attending lecture, and Dr. Ngo is definitely friendly and approachable! A little difficult, but study and you should be good to go.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	5	1509744	7/7/12	Awesome teacher. He really likes to get the students to solve problems for themselves but has no problem guiding you once you have come up with a solution. I recommend visiting him in office hours, that is when the real teaching happens.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	1	Computer Science	489	1	3	4	1509744	12/12/10	RUN. Apparently also a grad class (589). Completely taught towards the grad students. We had the same tests, homeworks, and projects as the grad sudents; just a separate curve. Insane projects that he only taught the theory beind. Never wrote a single line of code in lecture and assumed you knew things never covered by our previous classes at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	5	1509744	2/2/13	It was divine experience to attend his lectures.Whatever he says in lecture he can prove it :).He is a combination of pure mathematical,practical, theoretical reference book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	3	5	4	1509744	12/13/12	Clear explanations. Relevant assignments and tests. Fair grading system,cared more about grasping the concepts than having every closing bracket on tests. Helpful during office hours. Challenging assignments, but really interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hung Ngo	4.6	2	Computer Science	250	2	5	5	1509744	5/8/12	Midterms are easy, final is hard. 1/3 of the HWs are written and 2/3 are coding. Most of the contents are interesting, but I strongly suggest you to learn C++ before taking this class. Its not Java class, our best days are gone!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Nickerson	5.0	2	Medicine	254	5	5	4	261744	3/7/11	Very nice man. Genuinely interested in what students have to say. Class is discussion based. Grades are partially based on peer grading which usually results in everybody getting an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Nickerson	5.0	2	Medicine	250	5	5	4	261744	4/28/06	LOVE HIM, but he smells really bad. Take his honors seminar you'll learn a lot and it's not stressful-no tests
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Nickerson	5.0	2	Medicine		5	5	2	261744	5/9/09	This class is a guarenteed A. I slept overtly every class, and still got the A. Plus, you just have to do 3 presentations, even if they're half-assed, and then BS your "questions" for other presentations. If you're in the Honors program and this seminar is offered, and given that you're a slacker like me, take this seminar, you'll be glad you did!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Nicoletti	4.5	2	Social Science	314	3	5	3	1611768	3/8/12	Nicoletti is the man! Seriously, he could teach other professors how to teach. He does expect a solid effort on your part, but you get his in return. He delineates the course information with awesome clarity; he makes sure you're aware of what he wants you to know. Phenomenal educator. Take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nicholas Nicoletti	4.5	2	Social Science	314	2	4	5	1611768	8/23/11	So, class hasn't even begun and already this dude has issued ALOT of reading to do before class begins. It's the end of summer vaca. and I can't fathom a professor who wants to ruin the last few days with over 30 pages of reading issued via UBLEARNS. Dropped the class for something else before it even began. I'm a senior and I'm looking 4 peace.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	1	English	102	4	3	2	915506	12/23/10	Very sweet lady. Extremely nice lady from Finland with only a minor accent. You can revise papers whenever you want for higher grade, but requires a final portfolio which needs revisions. Lectures are usually kinda pointless but fun if you make them that way because the class is pretty much all discussion not just lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	1	English	102	3	1	1	915506	8/13/09	Terrible prof not helpful at all and hard grader she lets you rewrite papers however doesnt really make a significant difference also if you decide to rewrite a paper you are supposed to meet with her but shes never available and office hours is the time she prepares lesson plan so cant see her then either
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	1	English	102	3	4	1	915506	1/27/08	I don't like English that much so I dreaded the class. But she does a good job conveying the material. You can't miss more than 2 classes. She has a strong accent and is sometimes hard to understand. Just do the work and you'll get a good grade/
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	0	English	102	1	1	2	915506	10/16/07	Wow, she is one of the most confusing teachers I have had and a bit misleading when it comes to deadlines.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	201	4	5	2	915506	4/12/07	Attendance is mandatory. She is extremely helpful during her office hours. She is a pretty tough grader when she grades your papers, but you can always revise them for a higher grade. Your overall class grade is usauly higher than the average of your papers. Slight accent, but easy to understand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	101	4	5	4	915506	1/16/07	The two commentors below must be biased. I'm sure they had bad grades. I found the class really helpful. My writing improved a lot and I feel like I learned something. I would recommend her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	0	English	101	3	1	1	915506	12/6/06	DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HER IF YOU CAN HELP IT... She doesn't understand english well enough to understand questions in class. She grades randomly and gives out work that has nothing to do with the class . Find a different teacher if you can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	102	4	5	3	915506	3/20/10	Hey guys, take it easy. She's not a real professor yet, she's a grad student, and her classes or so simple if you read or look up online. She's very nice if you want to make revisions, but she IS a tough grader (its for your own good).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	101	4	3	1	915506	8/11/08	No major problems. She has a slight Finnish accent, but it wasn't a problem for me at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	102	4	5	3	915506	1/8/08	Given that it is an Intro class, there is nothing extraordinary about it, but Prof.Niemi does a good job at it. Granted, it is sometimes difficult to follow her train of thought, and the last few weeks of class turn out to be a bit of a bore, she is easily the best ENG 102 professor I know. And I have heard horror stories of the others.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	0	English	102	5	1	1	915506	10/10/07	She doesn't form a good relationship with students, and teaches material that is standard for a freshman level of high school.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	0	English	101	1	1	1	915506	2/23/07	terrible. anything good posted on this website about her mustve been done by her. how can the english dept. expect someone who cant speak english to teach and grade an english class? avoid her at all costs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Minna Niemi	3.0	2	English	101	3	4	4	915506	1/7/07	I thought she was quite helpful. The assignments are good and class discussion was interesting. She's also really helpful during office hours. I would recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jon Nelson	5.0	2	Music	103	4	5	3	1505310	3/31/11	Really great guy. Teaches the rhythm section of Musicianship, and is extremely helpful. Very easy workload most semester but then requires more time for studying for listening and the concert requirement, which is a pain when the class is only 1 credit. In the end though, it's very helpful and necessary as a music student.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jon Nelson	5.0	2	Music	131	5	5	4	1505310	12/5/10	Great guy. No tuning in concert band which is weird. Picks cool music and likes to get stuff done quickly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karen Nemeth	4.5	2	Not Specified	202	5	5	4	387875	1/10/11	I found this class to be helpful. There is so much work for this class, so if you think you can just get away with not doing work at all, this isn't the right class. It is very easy work though. Essentially you have to really have interest in your future to get something out of this class. She always returned e-mails very timely.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karen Nemeth	4.5	2	Not Specified	202	4	5		387875	4/16/04	very helpful class for your future. teaches resumes, informational interviews, and other real life information. Def worth taking!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karen Nemeth	4.5	2	Not Specified	202	5	5	2	387875	2/15/07	this class was a waste of my time. I learned little to nothing. At least i got 3 credits out of it...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Aimee Neri	1.2	0	Social Work	545	1	2	4	1730728	4/10/13	Makes a .5 credit class really hard and does not give clear directions on assignments. Then marks off when you do not give what she "wants". She also takes a long time to hand back assignments if you get them at all. I wouldn't take her if you could avoid it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Aimee Neri	1.2	0	Social Work		2	1	2	1730728	3/26/13	Terrible teacher, expects too much for a 1/2 credit course! Doesn't give clear grading rubric then fails you if you don't meet her unspecified qualifications. Do not take her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	2	Library Science	505	3	5	4	1386466	2/3/13	Dr. Nesset is probably one of the best members of the LIS Dept. to take a class with. She is always willing to guide you in the right direction, extremely attentive, and hilarious. This class is only as hard as you make it. Put in the work and time and you will get the results.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	0	Library Science	505	1	2	4	1386466	12/1/12	She's a slave driver. She gives intense assignments in an introductory course without any guidance. Mocked a student for asking for clarification in front of the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	2	Library Science	501	2	5	5	1386466	7/28/10	Best teacher in the whole LIS program. Kind, and genuinely interested in students, and course. I only wish the rest of the staff here could be half of the teacher she is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	2	Library Science	598	2	5	5	1386466	1/4/10	Dr. Nesset is an amazing woman and a top-notch professor. She brings both her personal, professional and academic knowledge and experience to every class. She takes an active interest in every student. Without question she is the best professor I have had in my entire college experience. She is the best professor in the LIS program.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	0	Library Science	505	1	2	4	1386466	1/14/13	I would not recommend taking classes with her unless you are a very driven over-achiever, workaholic type of person. In my class, a handful of people dropped due to workload. A friend of mine literally had a breakdown due to workload. Nice lady, but obsessive amount of work. Too much for an introductory course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	2	Library Science	514	3	5	4	1386466	12/5/11	I've taken two of her classes and she is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. I learned a huge amount in her classes and she made the content very accessible. She obviously loves teaching and her door is always open to students. I highly recommend taking classes with her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Nesset	3.9	2	Library Science	505	2	5	3	1386466	4/22/10	Extremely personable and helpful. Her office door is always open to any students who need extra help. She loves what she does and shows it. She is one of the best instructors I have ever had.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	101	5	2	2	1153198	5/17/12	This class was awesome.Every tuesday,3 hours-that's it.No need to worry about psych except tuesday.4 exams-drops 1.Amazingly easy and straightforward exams if you read the book.yes, she has an accent but not bad to understand.She responds to emails if you have questions.OK class.What more can you expect at 7 to 10 at night?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology	101	3	3	2	1153198	12/13/11	This is one of those classes you just endure. For the most part, everything she says can be correlated with the readings. She is a fan of youtube, she uses it to show clips of experiments. Pros: She gives open books (open laptop) quizzes for extra points. Cons: She can't control the class. She's not very assertive, she just says please be quiet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology	101	3	3	1	1153198	12/23/09	She's German but not hard to understand. Doesn't really know how to teach-stands in one spot and reads her pwrpoints. She is nice but I wouldn't take her again. The test questions sometimes didn't make sense but exams usually weren't too bad. She does try to make things easier (extra credit & drops lowest test). Online quizzes are easy. Got an A-.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	101	2	2	1	1153198	12/12/09	She is one of the worst professors in UB. She does not know how to teach AT ALL plus her class is at 8am and in that too she keeps in-class assignments which many students don't attend so even if u do realy well in your exams you would still end up with atleast a B- cos of the in-class assignments. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	2	Psychology	101	4	3	4	1153198	12/2/09	she knows her stuff but has a hard time explaining it. seems insecure & unable to handle a large class. go to class, she gives in class assignments often. tests are relatively easy if you study. online quizzes are super easy. class can get boring and she's quiet, but it's not too bad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	2	Psychology	101	5	4	4	1153198	10/15/09	She is a realllyyyy sweet/kind professor. She does put a lot of effort in teaching and has her subtle ways of making class easier on her students. She prob wouldn't mind if students chose not to attend her class everyday, but since the class can't be exactly empty either, she uses the clickr very often. She has accent so beware Intern Studen!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	101	2	2	2	1153198	9/17/09	Attempts to teach way too much. Read the textbook chapters before going to class because class tends to drag on due to language barrier and teaching style. Chapter quizzes are easy, tests are difficult. Print out powerpoints, take notes while reading, in class and highlight when studying. Important to go to class, in-class assignments for grades.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	351	3	2	2	1153198	7/11/09	She tries 2 teach & tries 2 cover as much of d material as possible. She speaks w/ a German accent, you can still understand her. The exams were difficult but she curves them. She gives in-class assignments & online quizzes which helps a lot. She played me on my grade. She gave me a C when I should had gotten a B.(not enough room left 2 explain why
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	101	3	1	4	1153198	5/14/12	This class was torture. She has a German accent that can be hard to understand at times and its nearly impossible to pay attention cuz shes so boring. She has in class activities every once in a while to take attendance. I had her for 3 hours every tuesday and we always got out early. I never paid attention and took notes on the book and got an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology	101	4	3	3	1153198	6/25/10	Lecture is extremely boring, even when I tried to pay close attention I found myself drifting off half way through the class. Tests were not too difficult, I pretty much stopped going to lecture half way through the semester and I still got a B. Yes she has an accent but I found her understandable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	0	Psychology	101	3	1	2	1153198	12/16/09	one word: awful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology	101	3	3	2	1153198	12/8/09	Shes a smart woman and knows her stuff but its noticeable that she doesnt know how to teach a huge class...i recommend going to class cause theres in class assignments which are easy. Exams are pretty easy as long as you study the material!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology		2	4	3	1153198	11/7/09	Energetic, Nice. She can be difficult to understand with the accent she has. read the chapters, pay attention in class. Take notes on the chapters you go over. Read her power-points.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	2	Psychology	351	4	5	5	1153198	10/14/09	I thought that she was a great professor! She knows her stuff. Class attendance was necessary. She went over things that were important and on the exam. Extra credit was also offered during class. It is because of this class, that I am interested in neuroscience. For those of you who are upset about her accent, get over it! welcome to UB!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	1	Psychology	101	3	3	4	1153198	9/4/09	She covers too much material and doesnt spend enough time on each one, the tests are HARD but she gives really easy quizzes and alot of free points, she isnt really engaged in her students so the class gets boring very easily
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	A Neumann	2.8	2	Psychology	351	2	4	4	1153198	3/21/09	Difficult class, but not impenetrably so. Tests mostly on book related material but sometimes offers extra points to those that show up to class and the lectures are definitely worth going to. Helpful with questions, and she really knows the material. Quite a good professor overall.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kristen NG	4.5	2	Political Science	303	4	5	4	1464116	8/10/10	Her class was pretty easy. You just have to make sure you do the reading, cause there's a quiz every class, but she drops 3 of them. The midterm doesn't count towards your grade, so basically your grade is based on whether or not you talk in class and the quizes. Easy A!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	448	4	3	4	503255	12/20/11	Unbeknownst to me it was a Undergrad/Grad-based demographic, Gary is incredibly intelligent and poignant. He's certainly "out-there", but funny and makes Art enjoyable. Countering some of the incredibly uptight, cold Art History teachers in the department, he's a treat. Make sure to read the textbooks, though. Recommended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	260	4	5	2	503255	4/28/10	I didn't know what I got myself into the first couple classes, but after that Gary's intelligence and witty nature really made me enjoy every second of class. He's blunt, he's funny, incredibly smart and truly a one of a kind professor. I'm graduating and wish I could take another class of Gary's! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	1	Fine Arts	150	5	4	4	503255	10/26/08	Every other class he lectures and the rest of the time he shows videos. You have to read the books. He wont test you on the information but it will come back to bite you in the end because you need to know the info and use it on the final paper. No tests, no homework. just attendance based plus the final paper
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	260	5	4	5	503255	3/9/08	It is true he is very smart and creative, but he relies too heavily on the same old heroes, especially Guy Debord. One word sums it up nicely for Gary, not only in the class room, but also in artistic expression. Megalomania. He has a ridiculous reputation among students of Henry Sussman, for example.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	150	4	5	4	503255	2/19/06	He is an amzingly smart person! The kids in this class don't get him cause they don't read and are lazy. I learned so much from him, it's like he's got the key...it just takes some figuring out. It all hit me a year after the class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	260	4	4	5	503255	8/31/05	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	1	Fine Arts	150	3	3	1	503255	11/17/04	i dont understand his lectures.. he says "Fetishism" WAYYY too much
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	494	2	5	5	503255	4/30/10	I had Gary for senior thesis. He really challenged my ideas as an artist and fully pushed my ability to the highest potential. He motivated me and the rest of the class while treating us as adults to produce high quality art and be innovative with our ideas. He encouraged creativity and was a wonderful professor for this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	260	4	5	3	503255	3/17/10	Gary can be intimidating but this class really changed all my views on art and how I approach it. He really makes you think, and I never thought I'd become this interested in theory, but he roped me in! Great guy, interesting class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	150	2	4	5	503255	10/21/08	He definitly knows what he's talking about! In lecture he can be somewhat dry but still very informative. The texts he chooses are of a difficult level, hard to stay awake while reading. But if you get through all the readings you'll be on the right track! Definitly knows how to pick the strangest videos to watch in class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	449	5	3	5	503255	6/23/07	He's kind of like a wayward space alien come to Earth, but in a good way. You have to be a little strange to teach art theory, so he makes the class worthwhile. Good teacher, interesting lectures, entertaining to listen to.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	260	5	4	2	503255	10/30/05	he is the easiest professor i've ever had
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gary Nickard	4.2	2	Fine Arts	150	4	5	1	503255	1/25/05	Do the work and you'll be fine. If you need help or would like to make sure your grades as you would like them to be just stop by his office for a chat. He is a sweet man.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	101	3	5	2	1112379	12/7/12	Dan is probably my favorite professor ever. Incredibly funny and talking to him is like talking to a friend. Very funny and very helpful. I think this year was his first at Hilbert, but I recommend any class of his.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	904	3	5	5	1112379	1/2/12	Extremely helpful. Don't miss his class because u will miss a lot of info. He is a great teacher and had ur back as a student 100%. It's good to have a teacher that cares about education. Loved him. Best teacher ever. U will learn a lot and he makes sure u understand what ur learning. Took his Intro to Soc course at NCCC.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	21	4	5	2	1112379	10/5/10	Best teacher you'll ever get. Really cares about you as a student (doesn't just blow off your emails or questions) Going to class was super easy because he's so funny and interesting to listen to. Def take his classes!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	2	5	4	1112379	12/14/09	Great professor, make class interesting with jokes and can relate otherwise boring material to your real life. Definitely suggest you take research methods with Dan. Class is a lot of work but it is worth it. Theres no reason you cant get an A in his class if you come to class, pay attention and do the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	4	5	1	1112379	11/24/09	By far one of the best teachers I've had at UB. Takes what could be a very literal and difficult class to sit through and makes it enjoyable and relative to students. Very funny, down to earth, and helpful- actually wanted to get up and go to class (and I was originally dreading taking research methods). DEFINITELY suggest you get Dan for any class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	4	5	2	1112379	6/9/09	AMAAAAZZZZZING. so understanding, nice, funny, one of the best professors i've had so far
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	3	3	3	1112379	10/21/08	classes are dull, a lot of terminology, homework is fairly simple
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	293	3	5	4	1112379	5/8/12	Great professor! Made class very interesting. Social stratifications was a good class. Dan is funny and makes jokes but really knows the material. I would take more classes with him. He is very professional and presents material well. Do the work, show up to class, and pay attention you will do well!- thanks for a great semester dan!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	101	4	5	4	1112379	12/22/11	Great teacher, really funny. Helpful, will take time aside for you and he enforces it. Please respond when he asks the class a question. You might want to see his tattoo on his chest.. like I didnt see it!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	3	5	2	1112379	4/15/10	Dan is really funny, very willing to help you when you need it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	4	5	3	1112379	12/10/09	Great professor. The project was a bit of work but definitely a lot of fun and very interesting to do. he doesnt make you do things for no reason and is very very approachable. Dan is also hysterical in class and makes the class as interesting as research methods could be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	2	4	3	1112379	11/19/09	Dan is very funny
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	5	4	3	1112379	12/9/08	love him hes too legit.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Daniel Nickolai	4.6	2	Social Science	213	3	3	4	1112379	9/5/08	keeps class interesting with little jokes and class discussion. homeworks are not often and helpful to the topics, not just busy work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Xiaofeng Nie	3.0	2	Engineering	6002	4	5	5	1092488	8/26/12	he's such a good guy!I like him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Xiaofeng Nie	3.0	0	Engineering	305	3	1	3	1092488	1/14/08	Chinese professor, so no one really understood what he was satying. The course work was actually pretty easy, but the way he taught it was really bad. The book he chose was also hard to understand. Homework and quizes count for 20% of the grade, the rest 2 midterms and a final. Overall, stay away.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History		4	3	4	1126804	4/11/13	Good teacher, do a little reading, go to class and prepare for mid term essays BEFORE they are due. In class mid terms are a joke. Just follow the above steps and collect your A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	0	History	211	1	2	1	1126804	4/11/12	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM AS A PROFESSOR!!! this class was very boring. the notes are unclear and he goes on wild tangents about uninteresting subjects. nice man but would be better teaching a small class not a lecture hall. test directions were always unclear avoid this professor if you can. if not good luck... sit int the front!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History	112	5	5	5	1126804	4/16/11	He is a very good teacher, but would be a better high school history teacher than a professor. He is very strict about talking, cell phone use, laptops, etc. It's just like a high school class but very easy to get an A. He really knows what he's talking about and is very passionate about history.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History	112	4	4	1	1126804	4/24/10	pretty easy class. midterm was an easy A and definately less stressful that it's only a paper and the final is the same way. there's an in class portion too but it's not hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	1	History	112	2	2	1	1126804	4/11/10	Gives A LOT of homework, average of 120 pages per week w/ a response paper that just gets a "s" or "u" grade. Only major grades are a midterm and a final, which aren't too hard, but the biggest parts of your grade for those are essays (one for the midterm, two for the final). Just WAY too much work for a gen ed, w/ most of it not really counting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History	112	4	5	1	1126804	3/3/10	Too much work for a gen. ed. TA gets mad when you don't do the 100-150 pages of mandatory reading per week. Grading system sketchy. Lecture notes are terrible. Professor is pretty scatterbrained and mumbly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History	101	2	5	5	1126804	5/10/08	I love Carl's class. He is so well informed and makes great connections to current events. I love his liberal attitude. He doesn't just talk the talk- he walks it. He's really involved in the community. Take his class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	0	History	112	3	1	1	1126804	4/8/13	Horrible teaching skills. His notes have nothing to do with what your paper and exams are on. His mid-term and final are easy but you have to study independently for them. He's absolutely no help at all. His lectures are easy to skip and are really boring.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	1	History	112	4	3	2	1126804	4/27/11	If you don't like reading, do not take this class. You have weekly readings and 1 page essays to do. The tests are essays which are not bad, but class is extremelt boring. He posts lecture slides online, but with 4 weeks left, he banned laptop use, so i could not take notes anymore
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	0	History	112	1	1	1	1126804	11/30/10	Do not take this class at all. Your grade depends on your TA. I had the most terrible TA ever known to mankind. Was very very disappointed with my TA and the grade she gave me when i had put in so much hard work and effort.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	0	History	112	1	1	3	1126804	4/23/10	Avoid this class if at all possible, its way too much work for a gen ed, and especially for a lecture where the prof rambles on about useless material. No one should have 120 pages of reading for world civ. More than 5 books to read and unclear grading system. Dont take this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	1	History	112	2	3	1	1126804	3/28/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless your extemely interested in history and its interrelation. It's a gen ed and he makes it terrible. There is over 100 pages of reading each week and 4-5 books for the class. The class is pretty easy if you plan on spending several hours every week on it, but if you are a nonhistory major this class is too much work
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	1	History	112	1	3	2	1126804	2/27/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! It is very labor intensive and there is a ton of reading that goes along with it. He is not a bad guy, but the amount of work we do does not have anyplace in his hazy grading system. Hes one of those teachers that think we have nothing else to do besides this gen ed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carl Nightingale	3.1	2	History	112	4	5	3	1126804	5/6/08	Very good teacher that tries to open up your eyes to the World. Definetly take him if your interested in history! Grading is pretty easy with your assignment being a one page paper every week on the reading, midterm, and final. Great teacher overall!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	345	4	5	4	775486	12/8/10	Will of the mind. That's her in a nutshell.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	101	1	1	1	775486	12/7/09	just finished last lecture with her and I will tell you right now.DON"T TAKE HER, She is mean and you will consistently hear her pointless rants and raves. the last lecture she pretty much told us how she does us a favor by teaching us and how this university exists for grad students. she is horrible and RUDE!. btw we are not arrogant. YOU ARE!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	4	2	1	775486	11/18/09	She is definitely annoying and bickers all the time about how stupid everyone is compared to her. She loves to make people feel bad, and there isn't a day where she doesn't say something rude to her students. However, her first test was very easy and it is mandatory to go to recititation which is fairly annoying since no one even speaks.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	5	4	5	775486	10/13/09	She is absolutely brilliant! I really liked going to class and hearing her lectures. Don't bother reading the negative comments, she isn't mean. The test questions are ridiculously easy. Easy class and very interesting woman.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	000	4	5	5	775486	8/22/06	Prof. Nikolopoulou is one of the most brilliant professors I have ever had in my entire academic career. She is upfront about the work she expects and is there to push her students to learn. She is extremely open minded and is not afraid to express a different opinion. People who are bad mouthing her are either stupid, lazy or both!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	5	5	5	775486	5/4/06	Seriously ignore the bad comments. Easy A, and interesting, and she wears cute outfits. She says attendance is mandatory but only took it 3 or 4 times. She also loves to talk outside of lecture. I REALLY RECOMMEND HER.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	3	1	3	775486	4/7/06	Horrible. Calls first day "how to behave like a human being 101." Teaches how to address an email correctly, but won't accept them. Mandatory attendance, very paranoid-random during week and classes compares signatures. Lectures have few solid points-definite babbler. She's a last resort professor for those who just want get the credit done asap.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	4	5	5	775486	3/8/06	VERY GOOD PROF.!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	1	Literature	111	4	3	3	775486	1/17/06	Class is not hard. But you have to pay attention and take good notes. Txtbk helps a lot. Only 2 tests which are real easy. Idk what all these people are saying bc she was really nice. Just don't be an idiot and get on her bad side (like leave in the middle of class). Attendance is important & dont sign in for friends bc she will catch & punish you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	2	1	2	775486	1/9/06	This was not a history class at all. We read books and tried to relate it to events in history. Horrible professor who is mean and unreasonable. TA Sol Peleaz contradicted what was taught in lectures and speaks worse english than Kalliopi. Transfer out if you can
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	4	3	3	775486	12/10/09	lets just say she thinks she is better than everyone. two immature guys talk and she rants that the whole class is stupid and her last exam what the hell she said there would not be dates, yeah there was and then all this studying which was worth nothing at the end only the multiple choice and she just goes on and on while she knows her info back a
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	5	5	1	775486	12/2/09	best professor ever. so insightful and interesting, with a true passion for the material. scholarly. her insights seriously changed my life. yes, she gets annoyed w/ students who blow off the class but YOU'RE IN COLLEGE. suck it up and do the work. you will get so much out of this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	5	5	1	775486	10/13/09	ok this is def the best professor out there for world civ. Her lectures are actually fun and she gives the easiest test out there. I didnt open the book not even once and still got an A, trust me you want this one.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	5	1	2	775486	11/10/06	Her first class is discipline and how to properly address a proffessor. I haven't seen such talk since I went to Boot Camp. If you get her for UGC 111, she'll basically tell you how she hates to teach it. Not exactly the best attitude. But besides that easy a if you get a lazy TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature		4	5	5	775486	5/29/06	Kalliopi is one of the smartest scholars I have ever known. Her knowledge in philosophy is mind-boggling, and her willingness to work through difficult ideas is truly remarkable. She is an excellent professor who can and will open new intellectual doors for you...as long as you're willing to try.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	5	4	3	775486	4/17/06	Unlike previous reviewers, I didnt mind the class. It kinda sucked reading all the books but she blatently says what she wants on tests, which were pretty easy. Class is fairly easy, and a lot better than other world civs Ive heard about
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	1	Literature	111	4	3	1	775486	4/5/06	Definitely a good professor.She really knows what she's talking about and the tests are very fair.This course is art and literature based so avoid it if you know you won't do the reading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	111	4	5	4	775486	1/26/06	I thought this professor was of utmost quality. She led her class through clear and consice lectures, clearly demonstrated the most important points and integrated pertinant literature to accompany the information. The organization of her syllabus helped inexplicably to keep those interested on track. I would most definitly recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	1	1	1	775486	1/11/06	WORST TEACHER EVER!!!! She HATES her students and treats them as inferiors, and well that might be true, but she doesn't need to emphasize on it!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	4	2	5	775486	12/30/05	Overall the course was not hard at all. As long as you study and attend lecture regularly you will be fine. Although this is true, I would NEVER recommend her to students!!She is very mean and condescending, she slashes American culture, and most of all she seems to despise Christian beliefs openly in class!!She speaks awfully bad about the Bible 2
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	2	Literature	330	4	3	5	775486	12/20/05	The only reason that anyone doesn't like her is that she comes down HARD on morons and is naive enough to still expect her students to be interested in learning
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	1	Literature	111	2	3	3	775486	12/13/05	basically if you pay attention in lectures you will do alright you have to read and you have to take notes but shes not a very hard teacher if you pay attention. focuses on epics and pictures... just pay attention and go to lecture - attendance does count btw
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	2	2	4	775486	12/9/05	Not a difficult professor, but she made the course harder than a gen ed requirement should be. Everything she teaches has to do with epic poetry, which sucks. Mean-spirited lecturer, has general disdane for her students. Don't recommend, however, I found her oddly attractive for some strange reason, maybe because I'm a masochist.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	2	1	1	775486	12/13/05	WORST AND MEANEST TEACHER EVER! she hates americans for no reason. She mine as well just leave the country. I dont get her. She needs to focus more on teaching the class than picking on others. Try to get other teachers before you get stuck with her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kalliopi Nikolopoulou	3.2	0	Literature	111	2	2	3	775486	12/10/05	Bad teacher,She teaches her class like it is a 300 level history. You are required to read alot of books and all of them are Epics, focuses on pictures as well. The class was not too difficult but you had to put alot of study time. Most importantly she takes attendence and thats a decent amount of your grade. Advise try and stay away from her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johannes Nitsche	4.2	2	Engineering	531	2	5	5	92346	6/26/11	Great Prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johannes Nitsche	4.2	2	Engineering	212	1	4	3	92346	5/22/10	The guy is the epitome of nerd. But he teaches concisely and really well. Be prepared for long homework assignments, often due the next class - but it's well worth it. By the time exams come 'round, you'll be so used to doing problems that it'll be a piece of cake.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johannes Nitsche	4.2	2	Engineering	212	2	4	3	92346	10/26/09	Please set easier test papers. have mercy on the students

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Noonan	5.0	2	Film	155	5	5	3	1692798	2/8/12	Pretty much the man. Class isn't hard at all, he tells you what he expects and it's pretty much a shoo in to get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nick  Notarius	4.8	2	Business	201	3	5	2	1765361	12/12/12	he very good with statistic and computer. nice boy but grade my paper hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nick  Notarius	4.8	2	Business	201	4	5	4	1765361	11/20/12	Nick has been an excellent TA for Statistics. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is very approachable and knowledgeable of the subject material. He can get confusing at times and difficult to understand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John  Nuchereno	5.0	2	Law	520	3	5	3	1757658	1/29/13	Best professor at UB so far. Funny and interesting. Did not do that well on the Exam - but I blame that on myself and not on him. He was the best.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John  Nuchereno	5.0	2	Law	613	3	5	5	1757658	10/25/12	One of the best profs I've had at UB Law. Class is early (8am) because he practices still, but it was by far my favorite class. Good stories based on practice, funny, effective teacher. Highly recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John  Nuchereno	5.0	2	Law	613	3	5	3	1757658	12/12/12	Amazing. Hilarious. Animated. Super-knowledgable. He is a big time criminal defense attorney (felonies, murder, death penalty) and he knows what he's talking about. Super funny and uses practical examples. I barely even needed to study - remembered everything from class.. The Nuch is the man
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	101	5	5	5	509835	12/16/12	Best Teacher Ever! She's always willing to help you out, and it's pretty clear what you're going to be tested on. You're allowed three absences, but I never missed a day because it was so awesome!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	101	4	5	5	509835	12/22/06	Danuta is a great professor. Although learning the Polish language is difficult, she really tries to help every single one of her students understand it as best she can. She lets you use notes on tests (3 in total), and is very leaniant while grading written papers (also 3 in total). She is also very warm and friendly during class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	101	5	5	5	509835	12/26/05	Danuta is and AWESOME Professor, anyone who is interested in language will find that this class is very easy. She is always willin to help students in any way that she can. BUT DO NOT ASK FOR OPEN BOOK TESTS!!! They are much more difficult, even if you have studied for them. Homework is minimal almost non-existent. She is a great,& passionate Prof.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	101	4	5	5	509835	12/24/11	Professor Nycz definitely gives you the attention and help you need in order to do very well in this class! Come to class, do the hw, and extra credit in order to get an A. All it takes is effort. Best teacher at UB thus far!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	203	5	5	5	509835	11/4/06	She's a great teacher, very kind and warm. Her small classes mean more individual attention to each student, and if youre willing to learn you will learn!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Danuta Nycz	5.0	2	Languages	101	5	5	4	509835	11/23/04	She is one of the best professors I have had at UB! Her classes are very well organized and she is very interested in the material while making the class fun. Overall, she is an excellent professor and I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to learn the Polish language.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	CA O'Brien	4.8	2	Social Science	407	5	5	4	1530971	1/17/12	SSC 407. Cheryl is a very helpful and respectable professor. I'm going into the field of gerontology and she opened a lot of doors for me. If you participate in class and pay attention to what she says then you'll be fine. The class it's self is easy, random participation days, so if you came to class u get credit. Its not mandatory to pass.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	CA O'Brien	4.8	2	Social Science	407	4	4	1	1530971	5/12/11	Healthcare and Elderly class. She's a geriatric social worker so she is seasoned in her knowledge. Topics are boring but she tries to lighten it up by bringing in guests. Her tests were easy...just study the material she gives during the review. Also, there's a required 10 hour volunteership with a local nursing home with a paper at the end.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	402	3	4	4	600394	12/23/11	She is a strict grader, but very fair, and goes out of her way to help students and clarify the course subject matter. A lot of memorization but you will do fine as long as you pay attention and do the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	0	Accounting	305	1	1	4	600394	4/10/11	She's a really great teacher, but DEFINITELY MAKE SURE to buy the book. It's absolutely necessary to pass her class. She takes attendance every class, and loves to use her footnotes as exam questions
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	403	2	5	3	600394	12/18/09	Definitely a tough class. Get ready to put a lot of hours in in order to pass this one. The tests she gives can be pretty tough and there is a ton of info to cover on each of them. She is very helpful in you have a question though and the hw does help once she covers it and explains everything
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	0	Accounting	402	1	1	2	600394	12/17/07	Collects HW before teaching the chapter...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	404	3	5	4	600394	3/26/07	The course is hard, the materials are difficult in general no matter who you take. She is very friendly and helpful. I like her notes along with the hw she goes over in class, very organized and useful when study for her exam. She takes attendance everyday, so make sure you don't skip too many times. Test is not that hard if you study for it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	0	Accounting	404	2	1	1	600394	4/19/05	She can not be any more dry and boring than she already is. The topics of the course aren't very interesting but she makes it even worse! Take with another prof if possible. Her quizes are SO random in difficulty that sometimes you dont study enough other times you waste your time studying too much
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	1	Accounting	222	4	3	4	600394	4/27/11	Make sure you review the book before her midterm. It's a _____. I barely passed it with a C- and I attended every one of her lectures and paid attention all the time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	402	3	4	2	600394	1/12/10	Go to class! Her tests are about 15 multiple choice and 2 true/false and a couple short answers. She drops the lowest test score out of the 3 midterms and the final on everything. But she tries to make it easy but be prepared to memorize a lot of information!!! So many lists!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	402	2	4	4	600394	11/6/09	Yes, the material is dry, but she is a good teacher. Gives thorough notes and goes over all homework in class. Grades the homework on effort and the tests are easy (with adequate studying). She makes it easy for everyone to get good grades, if they try.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	0	Accounting	402	1	2	3	600394	10/12/07	She collects hw daily and the material is awful. Studying for this class is like forcing yourself to eat foul food. This class will make you re-think your acct. major.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathy O'Donnell	3.3	2	Accounting	404	1	5	5	600394	3/12/06	Very nice and always willing to help. She is teaching a really hard class but she slows it down so you can understand everything. I am not getting the best grade in her class, but I still enjoy the way she teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vincent O'Neill	4.4	2	Theater	108	4	5	5	838161	5/4/12	Vincent is amazing. He's a great professor definitely one of the best I've had at UB. He knows what he's doing and the class is just plain fun. We play games, do fun activities, ice breakers and you learn very interesting things. It's pretty easy as long as you go to class and read the textbook. Definitely worth taking for an easy art requirement.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vincent O'Neill	4.4	0	Theater	108	5	2	2	838161	12/30/10	No one thinks as highly of Vincent as Vincent does. He's clearly intelligent, but is far too wrapped up with himself to really help his students grow.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vincent O'Neill	4.4	2	Theater	108	3	5	5	838161	4/26/06	excellent drama teacher! Really is passionate and clear about what he's talking about and in his feedback. Probably the best teacher in the department.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vincent O'Neill	4.4	2	Theater	108	4	5	4	838161	2/16/12	Definitely one of the best professors I've had. Very helpful and makes the class fun. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. Definitely going to take 109 if he's teaching it!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vincent O'Neill	4.4	2	Theater	108	4	5	4	838161	1/19/09	I just started getting into acting courses in my senior year, and Vincent has made it possible the greatest experience yet. He's extremely intelligent and passionate about his craft and loves to see his students persist. Incredibly easy to approach.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Luis Nieves	2.8	1	History	260270	2	3	3	624981	1/21/06	Nice guy, except for the fact that he is blatantly anti-American and hates capitalism. If your values lean towards socialism, he's probably the teacher for you. Group projects are unusual and require quite a bit of work, and are odd ("recruit people to the movement"). Many papers as well. I would not recommend this professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Luis Nieves	2.8	0	History	100	1	1	1	624981	5/19/06	.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Luis Nieves	2.8	0	History	100	2	1	2	624981	1/21/06	This guy is crazy, unorganized, and clearly anti- America. I dont recomend him,unless your Anti America. Also he tries to inlist his ideology, upon his students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Luis Nieves	2.8	2	History	103100	5	5	1	624981	5/24/05	Easy Class i ever took... It was a easy A.. All you have to do is go to class, present a topic to the class... and get 5 people to go to a presentation and 2 or 3 response papers and thats all and you A... And the teacher is really good..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tanja Niina Aho	5.0	2	History	225	4	5	5	1648632	4/7/13	AMAZING TEACHER! Ms. Aho is always willing to help her students in any way possible and keeps class inviting and interesting. You'll always want to attend for the intriguing discussion. A lot of reading, but it is interesting and enjoyable. If you have the chance, you MUST take a GGS course with her. By far my favorite class and teacher at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Niswonger	2.7	0	Philosophy	108	5	2	2	348856	9/17/05	i feel bad ranking him poorly, because he's a nice person who taught an easy class. the man can't teach, though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Niswonger	2.7	0	Philosophy	108	3	2		348856	2/4/04	very boring, vague, not very helpful and doesn't know what he is talking about. avoid him at all costs. btw, he is only a grad student.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Thomas Nochajski	3.2	2	Social Work		3	5	5	1214229	3/25/13	The instructor is extremely helpful and casual. However he has realistic expectations of his students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Thomas Nochajski	3.2	0	Social Work	510	1	2	4	1214229	11/23/08	Nice guy, knows a lot about research. Quizzes are unfair and you'll get 75% or so on them even though they're OPEN BOOK because he plays with semantics. The whole class nearly rioted because one was so unfair. Group projects are arbitrarily assigned, and you get little to no guidance. Material is not presented in a meaningful or memorable way.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	301	2	4	4	150413	12/30/10	Cathy is out of her mind, but fabulously so. She's brilliant and will expect you to put everything you've got into your work. Her classes will be slightly more difficult for you if you lack artistic talent (drawing, painting, etc).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		1	1	1	150413	5/19/09	worst class you will ever take. you will either love this woman or despise her. There is no doubt she is intelligent, but she doesn't treat you as an intelligent human being, just tries to get you to have a "revelation" that you are wrong and she is right.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater	203	3	1	1	150413	1/13/09	Not a particularly easy course when it comes to the work. You'll need to go every day and do the projects. It's not hard, but it's a bit work intensive. You'll need the textbook (no cd) and you'll need to do the readings. The quizzes are impossible. But, she takes pity in the end.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	4	4	2	150413	5/14/07	as long as u try your hardest, or appear to try, this class isn't bad. cathy really is nice, but she's very passionate about the class so don't show it if you don't care. it's easy as long as you take it somewhat seriously.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	4	4	2	150413	4/24/07	Cathy is a good professor but be prepared to feel like you don't know much when in her class. I'm not a Theatre or any art-style major so i just didn't really pay attention and got an A just by doing her online quizzes and turning in the work
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater		4	5	5	150413	5/16/06	Some of the students just don't get it and all they see is the class's effect on their gpa--which has its own validity for what it's worth, but still says nothing about Cathy, who is an amazing teacher who really knows what she's doing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	2	4	4	150413	10/27/05	Cathy has a way of getting the best out of you....even when you hate something or are struggling, she finds a way to get you to push harder and be more productive....she's great!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	5	5	4	150413	9/29/04	Cathy is awesome! The class is super easy. No artistic talent required. Some of it seems like bull, but it's still fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		4	1		150413	4/8/04	dont disagree
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater		2	5		150413	2/22/04	first thought she was just being hard, but theatre design at this level's about attrition. she's great at that... if you want to succeed she won't do anything but help you find your way. she's great!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	2	5	4	150413	3/2/10	Cathy is wonderful! She inspired me so much. You just have to learn to let go of all inhibitions and preconceived notions and listen to what she says. She will help you a lot if you ask. She is really a genius and if give your mind up to her teaching you will be pleasantly surprised with your own work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	5	5	5	150413	4/17/09	No matter what, Cathy will screw with your mind. That's a good thing - it's part of the course. If you're going to be a designer, you'll love her (or learn to). If you're doing this as a gen ed.... probably notsomuch. Oh, and for VI you don't need the full textbook. Google is your friend! (Get the plays though)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	406	4	5	5	150413	11/27/07	Cathy's the best professor. She's managed to teach me something, which in and of itself is a feat.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater		4	5	4	150413	4/30/07	the best
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	5	5	5	150413	4/5/07	CATHY IS AMAZING. a lot of people whine and complain...but they just cant take sarcasim and a little criticism. Her class is sooo fun, i feel like im in elementary art but better, its not hard if you participate and try its one of my favorite classes and cathy is histerical, you will love this women!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		3	1	4	150413	3/22/06	A phoney
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		3	1	3	150413	10/16/05	makes me want to transfer
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater	203	3	4		150413	4/13/04	Quirky, but what Theater prof isn't? Just try your best and put true effort into the projects and you'll be fine.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater		3	5		150413	3/6/03	Best experiences ever in her class. Not afraid to do what she needs to to make us understand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		3	1		150413	11/11/03	doesn't respect her peers - or students who have their own opinion
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	0	Theater		2	1		150413	5/2/03	unless you are an art freak, you will not like her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cathy Norgren	3.2	2	Theater		2	5		150413	2/26/03	quirky lady, we like her, doesn't put up with BS, because she knows you're better than that
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Yoshiko Nozaki	3.0	0	Education	511	5	1	5	78676	1/28/11	Course was not useful at all
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Yoshiko Nozaki	3.0	2	Education		1	5	3	78676	11/24/04	toughest but best i ever had
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Yoshiko Nozaki	3.0	2	Education	566	1	3	4	78676	11/21/05	Chooses wonderful readings. No surprise. was taught by Michael Apple. She likes discussion although she tends to increase teacher talking time and clings to her views. She won't yield despite evidenc.to contrary. Take this class. you will learn. Forget about her being authoritarian. She likes theories, which seems to be weak in the department.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jeff Nudd	5.0	2	Accounting	201	2	5	5	1660259	12/6/11	Really Nice TA, Helpful, Cheerful, Friendly, Funny,I really know my debits and credits...Thanks for Everything Mr. Nudd!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	119	5	5	4	750861	4/2/13	If you need some (unrelated to your major) classes, please take this class. It is super easy. I got an A. You do some exercise. She is so sweet and caring for her students. Just sign up for any of her classes. Always upbeat and joyful. Really recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	5	5	5	750861	5/2/12	Easy class. Nice and helpful instructor. Three exams and most questions are just easy you can answer them out of common sense. Interesting analogies given so students can understand the material easier.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	5	5	5	750861	1/3/12	She is a great teacher!!! Very kind and relates all subjects to real life situations which helps a lot. That's why I recommend going to lecture. I missed one which wasn't a big deal. She is very open to opinions about tests. If the test was unfair she gives points back.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	119	5	5	4	750861	12/21/09	Class is extremely easy. Easy A. I got an A- because I missed some classes, pissed me off but im fine with an A- I guess.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	5	4	3	750861	5/2/07	She's awesome, it's such an easy class. I just took it for science requirement, but I learned a lot of interesting information, and I never really went to class. Just go the day before her tests and she goes over everything on the exam, so all you have to do is study for a few hours (not even) the night before and you can get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science	108	4	1	3	750861	12/15/06	Only go to lecture if you want to listen to a good looking woman babble about things she cannot explain properly. Buy the book, read it, study it, and take the three exams. It is not hard or time consuming. If you do not need a science requirement for your major (i.e. business), take this course. I stopped going to class and got a "B" by reading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science	108	2	2	2	750861	6/28/06	Nice in person. She wants the class to be enthusiastic about material... and the more you ask questions and answer her questions, she wouldn't stop mid-lecture and tell you to go home. She would point out that "you would need to know this for the exam" and that helps slightly. :(
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science		2	1	1	750861	12/5/05	She is the worse teacher for nutrition. It is not an easy A at all. She tries to teach you through these stupid analagies but they don't work and she can't even read off the notes correctly. IF YOU NEED AN EASY A DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science	101	1	1	3	750861	11/8/05	If you like a challenge this teacher is the one for you! She tells people what to study for to prepare for the test and then the day of the test everything she told you to study wasn't even on the test! Her favorite sayings are "its a friday" or "its a monday", this is because she messes up on reading the lectures alot!. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	5	5	3	750861	5/31/12	Easy class. No HW. No attendance policy. Mult. choice exams. If you slack, just attend the lecture before the exam, study 5 hours max per test & you'll be fine. She sometimes makes mistakes, but they're rare & cute. Was even willing to answer my Q's unrelated to the course (during office hours). Beautiful, with a smile & voice that'll melt any man.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	4	4	5	750861	4/17/12	She's a great professor. Lectures are early in the morning so a lot of people don't attend, but they end up complaining about the exams. I go to class and she uses great analogies as much as she can to explain concepts. There are 3 exams which are NOT that hard. Easy class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	179	5	5	5	750861	4/9/11	I enjoy this class. Easiest teacher ever
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	5	4	3	750861	5/9/07	CLASS IS EXTREMELY EASY... YOU DONT HAVE TO GO TO CLASS AT ALL JUST GO TO CLASS A WEEK BEFORE THE EXAM AND DO THE REVIEW SHEET THROUGHLY THE TEST IS BASED ON THE REVIEW SHEET
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	4	4	2	750861	1/17/07	She is easy. U dont need to attend classes. she usually posts the important topics before all exams. Just study that. her exams are easy. need to memorize all the topics in the list. easy B+
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science	108	2	2	4	750861	11/3/06	She is pretty good looking but not a very good teacher, tests are hard and she doesn't really teach very well, there is no point in going to class all she does it read right out of the packet she gives you
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	2	Health Science	108	4	4	4	750861	4/14/06	good professor. little unsure of herself when lecturing, but she gives good examples, and lets you know EXACTLY whats on the exam. just go to class! ...seems she was a new professor...getting better with time. :o)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Nyrop	3.4	0	Health Science	108	3	2	4	750861	11/16/05	awful teacher, but knows her stuff if you ask her. the tests are based on lecture notes that you buy with your book. but there are blanks so you pretty much should go to lecture SHE CALLS ON PEOPLE AT RANDOM to answer questions she asks. terrible analogies.. smokin hot though. thats the only positive i can think of. pick a different teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shayne O'Neil	1.0	0	Architecture	501	3	1	2	1079843	2/8/10	That's right, waste of money, time, and effort in multiple projects in the end that don't make sense. Just remind him who is spending the money on the projects and who has to work to buy the materials.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shayne O'Neil	1.0	0	Architecture	501	1	1	2	1079843	12/19/07	Expects you to spend $500 on useless projects, critiques are never helpful, and grades harshly without a good explanation. Also, projects were not related to architecture at all so you won't learn anything. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Save yourself time, money and stay away from his bs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Socrates Of Athens	5.0	2	Philosophy	101	1	5	5	1616400	9/7/11	He was like a midwife to my philosophical ideas. I'll never forget him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hyungseon  OH	2.0	0	Electrical Engineering	450	1	3	4	1792608	1/15/13	Very smart guy but very disorganized class. Poor communicator. Incomprehensible grading system. No feedback is given on tests and homework. Changes his mind about homework and test questions very often (at times during tests). He is frustrating to deal with.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Onook OH	3.0	0	Business	404	3	1	2	1519755	6/30/11	He is the worst professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Onook OH	3.0	2	Business	404	5	5	3	1519755	12/28/10	For being from Korea and English being his second language I don't think anyone else could do a better job than Onook did. He kept what should have been a painfully boring class semi-interesting. Homework was incredibly easy and tests were alright. He worked with the class paper due dates and length wise and also curved accordingly. Great guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Olewnik	3.2	2	Engineering	277	1	4	3	1486860	12/4/12	Extremely critical grading implemented and homework assignments are a real pain sometimes. You better have a good group to work with for the project or this class will be a nightmare. Very helpful during office hours, but you need to show effort and not expect him to give you answers. No curve either, so don't blow it off.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Olewnik	3.2	0	Engineering	277	2	1	4	1486860	10/19/12	Absolutely one of the worst professors i have ever had. Grading is completely ridiculous and unfair, expects PhD level work out of sophomore engineering students. Doesn't curve class, tests seem easy but are graded by hitler himself. Avoid this guy at all costs
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Olewnik	3.2	2	Engineering	494	4	5	4	1486860	11/13/12	Had Prof. Olewnik for my senior design project in Mechanical Engineering. He was very helpful and gave us good direction in solving problems using innovation. I recommend doing the senior project with Olewnik instead of Mollendorf.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Olewnik	3.2	1	Engineering	311	1	3	3	1486860	10/25/10	He is too hard for a 300 level course. Nobody can understand his concepts and the hard numerical problems. Exams either all done or none.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	0	Law	501	3	2	3	222968	12/18/08	Good sense of humor. Sometimes unsure of what the point is or if something is relevant. Most helpful and clear the last 2 weeks of class. He tells you exactly whats on the exam, really no surprises. Gives a sample exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	1	Law		4	3	1	222968	4/18/06	Today is April 18th and we just got our Civ Pro grades for last fall. A really nice man, doesn't really teach anything but Civ Pro is straight-forward enough that it doesn't matter a whole lot anyway.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	2	Law		3	4	3	222968	4/12/05	He takes a very practical approach to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, so you will learn a lot. Thankfully, he does not use the Socratic Method. Amen. His grading determinations a re a mystery, as are those of all law school profs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	2	Law		4	3	3	222968	11/18/04	I really liked Olsen. Funny and approachable. He's the dean, too, so he's busy a lot (which can translate into classes cancelled on short notice) but it doesn't hinder his teaching ability. Average grader. Closed book exam is not fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	2	Law		2	4		222968	6/18/03	Really cool guy, really nice dean, will help you anytime. Cool class, learned a lot. But damned if I know how you get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	2	Law	501	4	4	1	222968	4/12/07	He was a good professor, made the material clear and easy to understand. However, we still do not have our grades from last fall's semester and that is frustrating.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	1	Law		4	3	3	222968	7/27/05	Prof. Olsen is a good teacher and I believe he genuinely cares about his students. My criticism as a 1st year student however is that in his capacity as Dean he has to do something about late 1st year grades. It really puts UB at a disadvantage in a competitive market. Many schools now charge their professors $50 a day when their grades are late
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	1	Law		4	3	3	222968	2/18/05	When he discussed ways to employ the rules for your client he was amazing. Most of the time I just thought he was telling a joke without a punchline.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R. Nils Olsen	3.3	2	Law		3	4		222968	7/23/03	he was great.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	2/13/13	I really enjoyed Professor Orange's class. He has funny sense of humor and is actually a nice guy though he can be a tad condescending; do not be intimidated. He underlines exactly what he expects from students with no ambiguity. Tests are exactly what he says they'll be in class and are very easy. My only complaint is the labs are useless!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	13	4	5	4	750	12/19/12	Literally tells students EXACTLY what is on the test. "This will be on the test." Gives the answers to homework assignments during lecture. Boring at times but it is evident that he is passionate about his profession. He LOVES when students goes to his office hours! If you do the practice tests you are Guaranteed an A. Recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	5	3	4	750	10/22/12	Very easy class. The online lectures are very boring though
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	3	5	3	750	1/3/12	Great teacher! He makes everything very simple. Goes over homework's in lectures so always watch them! The lectures are gold and need to be watched. But they are boring. Nights I couldn't fall asleep I would turn on a lecture and in 7 minutes I would be out.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	5	5	750	12/13/11	Professor Orrange is the man. Tests are a joke, got full points on both the 2 in class exams and final. Lost 1 point for the course. Simple HW. Easy to lose pts. because the margin for error is slim. (only 8 points before you lose the A!). Watch lectures as he states and goes over everything important that is needed. Fav. class & prof. at UB!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	3	750	11/8/11	Professor Orrange is an entertaining guy. The only textbook you need is the CIS textbook which is used in recitation, not the actual text for the class. I have a feeling the people who gave him bad ratings didn't watch the lectures. He gives you all the information you need to do well on the test in the lectures and even some test hints.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	4	4	3	750	8/15/11	Love him! He knows what he's talking about, goes over announcements a million times, which can be repetitive, but then won't deal with stupid people who didn't listen. That is their fault not his. Recitation is easy, exams, and final is easy if you watch the lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	301	4	1	3	750	5/29/11	Rude guy with no manners what so ever. Extremely rude. An advice, don't go to his lectures on Monday morning unless you want to spoil your week with his rude behavior. Good Luck. Btw, clarity of grades - not at all
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	3	750	12/23/10	He grades on a point system, and the space he leaves for an A is little to none. I ended up with a B+. Just watch the lectures online. Speed them up a little bit cause he talks mildly slow. I liked his humor, and his stories about past students. Overall great guy, easy-ish class. But if you have questions, bug your TA before you bug him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	5	5	3	750	4/29/10	He was a great teacher! Very helpful, homework was online and took awhile but could do it until you got 100%, 4 cases which were pretty easy if you were caught up with the lectures and he was always willing to help. 2 tests and a final, all open book/open notebook. awesome teacher! totally changed my outlook on math and statistics!! cool guy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	4	750	1/6/13	I didn't watch a single lecture and I earned an A-. Simply do the assignments on time, go to recitation every week, and study the practice tests a lot before the actual test. Professor Orrange seems like a cool funny guy but I had total ADD when it came to watching online lectures. I would recommend the class though
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	1	2	2	750	12/12/12	Horrible professor, very hard teaching methods. Avoid if you can!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	3	4	2	750	5/2/12	probably one of the most boring professors you will ever have. often spends most of the lectures either repeating old lectures or going way off topic however if you watch the lecture he goes over all exams and homework. pretty easy prof just mad boring.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	3	4	3	750	1/2/12	As long as you watched the lectures, you'd be fine. Don't miss an assignment, you'll regret it when you suddenly drop from an A to a B. The slim margin or error gets old though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	2	5	5	750	11/15/11	Great teacher if you go into his office hours and ask the right questions you will be fine on his projects. Online test everything is straight forward.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	3	750	11/5/11	Nothing like waking up on Tuesday and Thursday to catch your daily episode of Ray O. Just be careful because it is easy to lose points if you are careless on tests or homework. Nice guy and occasionally entertaining.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	3	4	2	750	6/29/11	the text book is useful because it has the practice exams and you can use it on the final, although its not a necessity. just share with a friend. watch lectures online because he goes over some test questions but notes are also posted online. very easy to loose lots of points in his class, hard to get an A. in general class isnt that hard
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	301	2	2	1	750	4/1/11	He is a very rude person, for your final make sure to study an excel spreadsheet that he puts heavy emphasis on (as well as all its functions). Final is completely different than anything he does in class.I would love to improve my grade however taking that class with him is not an option for me.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	2	1	2	750	8/17/10	ugly rude mean and all think the same
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	5	5	2	750	4/29/10	He was a great teacher! Very helpful, homework was online and took awhile but could do it until you got 100%, were 4 cases which were pretty easy if you were caught up with the lectures and he was always willing to help. 2 tests and a final, all open book/open notebook. awesome teacher! totally changed my outlook on math and statistics!! cool guy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	301	4	3	1	750	1/10/10	Worst professor but he is the only professor for MGQ so we have to suck it up. Watching his lectures I did not find was necessary but others may have. Only 2 tests which are fairly simple.5 cases are kind of difficult so make sure you get a productive group. I got a 70 on the final and still pulled an A because I got full credit on everything else
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	12/27/09	Great teacher. Gets off topic sometimes. Watch lecture at 1.7x speed and they go by real quick. Final is open notes/book. Answers e-mails quick and as long as you watch all the lectures, easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	4	4	3	750	12/20/09	I don't know what everyone else was talking about but he is really nice/helpful if you go to his office hours. He just doesn't like people who try to get grades higher than they deserve. You only have to watch the lectures around the exams (he goes over EVERYTHING thats gonna be on the test) and the homework is easy, I got an A in both 201 and 301.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	301	4	2	3	750	12/13/09	Agreed with some of these reviews; 100% unapproachable. He has a system to punish you for asking questions about grades. Petrified to send emails to him, dont wana lose points. watch review lectures (only) and u will basically get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	302	3	3	2	750	9/3/09	MGQ 301 was super easy if you go thru his practice midterms and exams.. MGQ302 NOT SO MUCH..i didnt watch lectures.. and i didnt know how to start the cases (just make sure you get a good group). watch the review lecture for the midterm and final.. midterm is way easier than u think and u overlook it..but u are timed.I got an A in301 and a B in 302
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	1	1	1	750	7/25/09	VERY unapproachable...makes a spectacle of anyone who sends a "stupid" email...VERY arrogant. Horrendous personality. Has quite a monopoly -only professor that teaches this mandatory class for business students. Convoluted grading system. I think he needs to read some of these comments & change his act!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	2	750	6/22/09	his lectures are obnoxious to watch, if you do, make sure to watch on fast forward, you can still understand him, and it goes much faster. he is so boring, but easy other wise.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	5	2	3	750	5/21/09	Incredibly easy, just know how to do every single problem in the text (there's not much only 4 chapters). I got an A and I didn't even know what he looked like until I had to take one of the make-up exams because I didn't watch a single second of lecture/video.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	5	2	1	750	4/24/09	He's like an old-school factory worker. He would work perfect for kids. considering that most college students have lower attention spans nowadays than a child watching willie Coyote DAMN.......... How can a person be this boring? I can get all the necessary info in 1 hr lecture in 5 minutes of his video. Also his formulas are convoluted.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	4	750	2/15/09	I don't understand the negative comments here... sure, it's kinda boring but if it is, FAST FORWARD. He's crystal clear and makes stuff like standard deviation easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	301	3	2	1	750	12/29/09	No need to watch the lectures. Got an A in the class. Only lecture you need to watch is the last one before the final. He goes over a carbon copy of the final. Take good notes on the lecture and you'll do good on the final. You do the homeworks till you get everything right but the statistical cases are difficult. Pick a good group for those
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	2	2	1	750	12/21/09	Very little room for mistake. Everything in his class is worth the same. Recitation portion of the course is very easy. You easily get full points for that portion. His lectures are exactly the same as the notes in the textbook. Don't lose points on the easy stuff. Overall, you do not learn much about statistic. Read the book, no need to watch.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	3	3	1	750	12/15/09	You really should watch lectures. He basically feeds you the questions and answers when you watch them. I do recommend watching them at 1.4 speed, because he stuffs a lot of useless info and talks slowly. Other than that... You should be good. Final is open book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	2	1	2	750	11/11/09	VERY rude when answering emails or questions. He thinks he is perfect while teaching lectures and that any confusion or questions are so unnecessary. Very unapproachable and sarcastic when answering emails. Tests are pretty fair but watching lectures are important.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4	2	750	8/3/09	I've taken both MGQ201 and 301 with Orrange (both classes are about the same level of difficulty). Overall I would say he is a decent instructor - it's not that hard to get an A if you put the time in. Main drawback: He tends to get side-tracked a LOT during lectures, so you'll wind up with a 70 minute lecture with 15 minutes of useful information.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4	3	750	7/16/09	He is very very boring, and keep saying things you dont even need ,the lecture may be helpful but you can get the main point in less than 10minutes, you will use a lot the statistic book but dont even bother you buying the Microsoft Office book you will NEVER need it!The statistic book is wrtten like a speech, really funny!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	5	1	750	6/2/09	If you MUST watch the lectures, drop the class. Not kidding you, 20X easier to take it in the summer. The online videos are torture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4	1	750	4/27/09	This class is absolutely easy for anyone. You just watch lectures online and go to a recitation once a week. Attendance is required and there are several homeworks to do during the semester, but not hard at all. HOWEVER, his way of talking is so annoying. He talks too much about useless things. Oh, who cares?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4	3	750	4/17/09	You have no chance but to take him, but he's really easy. If you just watch the lectures on fast forward (1.6 speed is perfect), and somewhat pay attention, this class is an EASY A. The TA's are usually pretty easy with grading as well. His tests are all open notes. Very straightforward. Just do HW's, quizzes, etc on time and you'll be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	3	2	1	750	1/15/09	this is the most useless class you will ever end up in. You have to watch lectures, very painful if you ask me. He spends half of the lectures repeating useless unnecessary stuff. horrible teacher, but class in general is pretty easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	1	1	1	750	1/10/09	This class doesn't enlighten you any;rather it is just another hurdle you have to get through in b-school.The professor is not exactly helpful in any sense of the word.The material is to the point and that makes it one of those "just do it" courses.The hw &exams are chores that you have to do to get the grade you want.Dont miss any of these chores.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	301	2	1	1	750	1/2/09	Absolutely the most ridiculous prof i have ever had. Hr and 20 min lec and about 5 min worth of usefullness. Terrible with emails and rambles about nothing most of the class. Only reason the class is easy cuz i didnt watch lectures and taught myself. Can't believe he actually got a teaching job. You will see what i mean once u take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	4	3	3	750	12/9/08	Ridiculous class, although the contents are okay, watching his lectures bores the crap out of you. Spends so much time not covering anything, making it difficult to keep watching. Should've took other stats class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	301	2	2	1	750	12/6/08	I don't find him to be very easy, but at least his grading scaling is clear, his class is the most boring class I have taken so far at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	5	4	750	12/5/08	Great teacher but this class is so pointless imo
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	5	5	2	750	10/22/08	Follow the rules, hand assignments in on time and don't make him mad = you will get an A. Amazing teacher, most clear-cut grading system you will get in all of college.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	4	750	6/15/08	very funny guy and is easy going. the class can be an easy A. the book is the same as the lecture you do not even need to go to class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	4	5	4	750	4/12/08	great prof. makes everything very clear & is very willing to answer questions about anything you dont understand. hw is an easy A b.c he lets you attempt each problem multiple times. gives lots of hints on the cases also. he says exactly the types of questions he is going to put on the tests so make sure you watch the lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	4	4	3	750	12/2/07	The class isn't hard, but you have little room for error. The homework is online and the tests are openbook. Sounds easy enough but there is very little room for mistakes, keep that in mind.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	4	3	4	750	11/5/07	MGQ301 was a little bit harder than MGQ201 was. The information was more indept and you get cases to do which are somewhat annoying, i recommend working in a group, however ray was the same as he always was. Watch lectures and you should be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	301	5	1	1	750	1/10/09	His exams are ridicutarted. They're meant to be on the easy side, but that seems to benefit the students who are half-assing it more than anyone. Impossible to fail, yet so cryptic and tricky that the studying of nerds is to no avail. Makes sense since Ray is a half-asser himself.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	5	3	1	750	12/9/08	The class is easy to do WELL in, but hard to get an A in. You can only lose 8 points in the whole class. You are allowed to use notes on tests and he tells you what's on the tests so as long as you don't make stupid mistakes then you can definitely get an A. I'm awful at statistics and I got an A,just make sure you watch the lectures or go to class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	4	1	1	750	12/7/08	Ray orange sucks at teaching. he is a dbag that doesn't care about anything other than making lame jokes. his lectures are boring as death and his tests always have trick questions. he is not funny, cool or smart. He should retire asap. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF ITS NOT A PREREQ.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	3	3	1	750	12/6/08	Make sure you defintely go to class or watch the lectures online...you really need to to pass the course. He gives two homework assignments (online) and 3 tests (including final which is mandatory) 150 points = A, not 100. Tests are 15 questions long. I stress the watching of his lectures! Or you'll fall behind quick.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	4	750	11/20/08	He's a great professor... watched a few of his lectures online, this course follows the book that he wrote so as long as you read it than youll do fine in the statistics part...you can bring notes to the tests....pretty easy class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	301	5	5	4	750	7/5/08	great professor. very clear & helpful. as long as you watch the lectures this class should be really easy. he goes through the exact types of questions that are going to be on exams & gives big hints on the cases. hw is an easy A which counts for 35% of your grade. tests are also open book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	5	750	4/21/08	Words cannot describe how great of a Professor he is. No exaggeration, he is helpful, clear and if you watch lectures, easy. He is a funny guy. There is little work ethic needed, you just need to set aside time to watch the lectures. I wish every Professor was like Professor Orrange.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	1	750	2/6/08	THE EASIEST CLASS EVER!!! HE SAYS EVERYTHING THAT WOULD BE ON THE EXAM ON HIS LECTURES ..WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT..??
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	2	3	2	750	11/5/07	This class is simply ridiculous! BUT it is pretty simple I did not watch the lectures although it may have helped the only thing that was ridiculous is if you own a MAC which i woiuld assume on this size campus YOU MAY....the lectures are not compatible AND the homework is different b/c you do not run the same programs therefore you must use a lib!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	5	2	2	750	10/14/07	took this last semester - a utter waste of time, a req so you have to take it, don't waste money on textbook, pointless work is all it is
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	1	Managerial Science	201	5	3	3	750	5/22/07	Alright this guy is not an easy A. Get that clear, but it is a very easy class to get a decent grade. You need 142 out of 150 to get an A. Make sure you dont make any stupid mistake on the hw, ask ur friend for it if they had taken it before. why? cuz they are the same. Just read the book, I got an A without watching any online lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	1	750	4/25/07	Alot of people give him a hard time, they are slackers. Ray is a funny guy with a good sense of humor. The secret to getting an a is as follows. Watch the lectures, go to recitation, and study for the tests and quizzes. Sound familiar? Thats how you succeed in college!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	5	750	1/17/07	He is the easiest prof i have ever taken for any course. JUST WATCH THE LECTURES. make notes from lectures and solve the practice test. easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	3	1	1	750	5/19/06	I agree with the last rating dont take this course if u dont have to. Also this course is overrated and not as easy as everyone suggests. The material is absolutely irrelevant and extremely boring tons of pointless assignments as with most classes that are about nothing. BUt then again its a STATS class so w/e.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	5	750	3/5/06	Very easy course and Orrange tries his best to make it that way. As long as you attend all recitations, do all the homework/labs, watch his lectures (which are very long), you'll get a good grade. He's humerous but tends to BS a lot in his lectures. His explanation of statistics can be more confusing than it has to be, but it's not too bad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4	2	750	12/26/05	Watch the lectures and you'll get an A, it is really as easy as that. The first test your allowed to bring in a notes sheet (front and back). You can submit all of your homeworks ahead of time to Ray and he'll grade them and if you don't get a 100% he'll let you resubmit them. Final is open book and open notes, just print off some stat tables.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	4	750	12/16/05	AWESOME PROFESSOR with a good sense of humor too. Easy class, take the online section and watch the lectures and it's an easy A. Its intro to stats and you learn about the basics of Microsoft word, excel and powerpoint.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	11/6/05	This professor is the man....professor if you go to this site....I love you...hiyoooooo
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	5/28/05	took the online section & didn't watch any of the lectures... got a B from just going to recitation, seriously. Neal is a pretty good TA, doesnt you the whole lab & grades easy. Buy the book pack for the stats materials... you'll need it & use it for the final!!! easy class, taken mostly by managment students so really not optional.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	11/15/04	if you have to take this class as a requirement, the buck stops here. orrange's class is online so you watch lectures @ home and just goto a once a week class, lectures are clear and easy to follow orrange has fair and simple tests if u watch the lecture.. i wish all teachers taught like this
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	2	750	5/8/07	I like most people didnt watch the lectures. The class is extreamly easy and if you do watch the lectures he gives you the answers to alot of the material. The class itself seemed pointless but its an easy 4 credit grade. Overall this is a class about following the rules and doing excatly what he tell you. if you do that you get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	5	1	1	750	4/2/07	first of all, go to class, watch the lectures, study and do the homework. If you do this you get an A like me. That said, Professor Orrange couldnt care less about his students. He is a disgrace to the profession and made me want to switch majors. He is derisive and abusive to his students. The class is a joke
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	5	750	12/15/06	This is a business prereq and it can be an easy A. The only way to fail is to not do the work. Recitation is mandatory and the lectures are online so you can watch whenever. Orrange goes over the exam material in lecture and his practice exams are like the real one. His attitude is not that he does not care, it is that you got what you earned.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	3	1	5	750	5/18/06	He is one of those professors that knows they are untouchable and couldn't care less about his students. He has been at the university far too long and his class is a JOKE. Anyone who has graduated from a decent high school will know the basics of computers and stats and will learn NOTHING new from his class. DON'T TAKE IT, if you don't HAVE to
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	0	Managerial Science	201	3	3	2	750	2/19/06	his method of explaining statistics is alot more confusing than it needs to be
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	4	750	12/20/05	Great class because it's easy and doesn't involve a lot of work. Professor is really good at helping and getting grades back.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	3	750	12/15/05	easiest class of all time. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK! IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY! just cram, watch all the lecture the day before, learn your****, and do the stuff in recitation and you will get an A. If you don't, you should probably end ur life.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5	2	750	6/27/05	Easy A, class was middle school statistics and simple word and excell questions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4	4	750	1/25/05	This class is an easy A. You learn basic computer stuff and some easy stats. He almost always lets you use notes or the books for exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	5	3	750	9/23/04	easy teacher, but recitation sucked, if you get bryan, SWITCH! he makes you do the most work possible but ray is a good guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	4		750	3/29/04	Very easy material. He was kind of cheesy, but in a funny way. He sometimes retold stories many times which were awful and didn't relate to anything in my life. He worked for campus parking. Why do I remember that.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5		750	11/6/03	Very easy class. He gives plenty of opportunities to get good grades. Show up in class and he'll show you how to do the homeworks. Fun professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5		750	4/1/03	This class was very easy and I learned a lot

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	4	4		750	12/26/03	Just go to every recitation and keep up with the work. Those tests sneak up on you when you dont go to lecture, ever. But its an easy class especially for a business major
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science	201	5	5		750	7/16/03	I think he's the only teacher, but an EASY CLASS!!! Learn how to use MS Word and stuff.. VERY SIMPLE.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raymond Orrange	3.8	2	Managerial Science		4	3		750	11/17/99	Goes a bit fast at times, but his class is relatively easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rafal Oszwaldowski	2.8	1	Physics	208	4	3	3	1561641	5/7/11	Decent professor, nice guy. Wileyplus homework and easy tests with fairly simple problems. All you need to do well is have a rough idea of what is going on and be able to use the (supplied) formula sheet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rafal Oszwaldowski	2.8	1	Physics	208	3	2	5	1561641	4/12/11	He kind of got stuck with this class last-minute because Dr Baur died, but I think he could do better. He barely speaks above a whisper, and is not good at announcing HW due dates (it's long and difficult, usually), or really anything else. Nice guy, good deadpan humor, but only an average instructor. I dislike how he teaches special relativity.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	112	3	5	3	334967	12/2/11	LOVED this professor!!! She's so sweet and understanding and really listens to her students. I'm terrible at history but honestly, just going to class and taking her notes helps a lot with review sheets. I have an A for the first time ever in history!! If you're willing to do the work, I highly recommend taking her class!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	0	Art History	346	1	2	5	334967	6/17/09	If you can avoid her than do it. I followed all of her guidelines and what it took to get an A and it seemed like nothing was working. I ended up with a B. Otto expects nothing less than perfect. This is not an easy A or B. Take the class only if you need to otherwise do not bother its a waste of time. Worst professor yet!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	372	3	5	4	334967	3/5/07	Otto is great, really helpful, always looking for student involvement and input. Took 102 also and her AHI elective classes are a lot better. Fair, knowledgeable, intresting and sometimes a bit of a push over. If your an AHI student shes a great pick.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	0	Art History	102	1	1	1	334967	4/26/06	worst freaken professor at UB. over 100 paintings to be memorized for each quiz and whats better she uses 6 and you have to compair and contrast the selected art works. not too bad if it wasnt timed you only have 7 mins to know the name, artist, date and at least 5 things that make this painting unique. she is the worst professor, i recived a B
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	1	Art History	102	2	3	3	334967	11/15/04	i hated this class. the lectures were so boring, and be ready memorize 50 pieces of artwork for the miderms and final. do not get her for recitation its the worst.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	102	3	5		334967	6/12/04	Great Class! Lectures interesting and I learned a TON. It's hard to cover so many periods in art history, and she did that really well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	0	Art History	102	5	1		334967	4/17/04	this was the easiest class ever.you have 2 papers + 2tests.basically u can teach urself from the book.UNFORTUNATELY u are forced to go to class and listen to her TRY and read.she must have missed public speaking day cuz she cant speak let alone teach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	1	Art History	102	4	3		334967	3/10/04	Easy course, booooring lectures, tests are simple, 2 papers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	112	2	4	3	334967	10/15/11	Bases her World Civilizations II class on Art History. Exams consist of memorizing 100 paintings and 10 explicit details from each and stating why they're relevent to history. May as well take art history.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	102	3	5	3	334967	3/7/09	wonderful professor. Very knowledgable and receptive to student feedback. I would recommend her course to any serious college student
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	102	5	5	5	334967	11/3/06	This class isn't that hard. Her review sheets look long but if you go to class and just write down the works she shows you will be fine. It isn't necessary to memorize all the works on the list, she dosen't test on works she hasn't discussed in class. Also, she is a very nice lady and it is obvious that she loves the topic.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	102	3	5	2	334967	3/23/06	She doesn't have midterms or finals anymore so grades are just on attendence, 2 or 3 quizzes, some essays and class participation (in the rec class). Class is easy as long as you read the book and keep up with lecture. Otto is really nice and very helpful. Isn't the most exciting class but an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History	102	3	4		334967	7/23/04	shes cool..a little into the art sometimes but is a very good listener and very understanding.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	0	Art History	102	5	1		334967	4/17/04	such a horrible teacher....she needs to find a job that she actually enjoys instead of torturing us during lecture...i dont think she knows that we can read the book on our own!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Otto	3.5	2	Art History		3	5		334967	4/2/04	she rawks
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephanie Ovalles	3.7	2	Chemistry	202	5	5	4	906686	10/24/07	Stephanie ROCKS!!!! At first glance she looks very serious, but she is actually very nice. She doesn't give you the answer to thing right away, b/c she wants you to figure it out for yourself first. Overall, if you do your work you will ace her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephanie Ovalles	3.7	2	Chemistry	201	5	5	5	906686	10/29/06	Stephanie is the best T.A. ever. She will sit down with you and help you figure out your chemistry questions. She looks very serious, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by its cover, b/c she is actually the nicest T.A. you will ever meet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephanie Ovalles	3.7	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	1	906686	9/5/07	Stephanie is the WORST TA this school has to offer. The first day she will announce how she is an organic chem TA and rub it in your face. But then as the semester goes on and you try to ask her a question, she avoids answering you because she doesnt know how to do the problem! She is a mean and horrible person. If you get her, SWITCH OUT NOW!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony O'Rourke	1.2	0	Law	000	2	1	3	1733837	11/9/12	Awful. He does not teach the material in a clear manner. To make up for it, he loves sending follow-up emails after each class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Anthony O'Rourke	1.2	0	Law		1	1	5	1733837	10/22/12	He is awful. Nice guy and knows his stuff (kind of), but extremely confusing. Hands down the hardest final I have taken (8 hour take home that was supposed to take 3 hours). Has potential to be a good professor, but right now he is awful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Ogden	4.0	2	Finance	405	5	4	4	619134	12/14/10	Ogden is a really nice man and teacher. Reviews strictly from the book so test questions come from end of chapter questions. Whole grade consists of 3 exams and attendance is not required however to learn you should go!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Ogden	4.0	1	Finance		1	5	1	619134	9/10/05	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joseph Ogden	4.0	2	Finance	695	4	5	5	619134	9/7/06	My fondest memories from my graduate education at UB involve Professor Ogden. He is a REMARKABLE human being and teacher. I very highly recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kwang Oh	4.0	2	Engineering	203	4	4	5	1000833	5/7/12	Professor Oh is a pretty solid teacher. Tests are taken from homework problems and his grading policy makes it so its pretty hard to get below a B. Homeworks are the only hard part of the class. Will make class laugh at least once a lecture (not mandatory). Very very fair grader and teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kwang Oh	4.0	2	Engineering	202	5	5	5	1000833	4/18/08	good professor...speaks perfect english, gives very fair tests and provide good lecture!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kwang Oh	4.0	1	Engineering	203	4	3	4	1000833	4/23/11	Oh's lectures are horrible, he spends most of the time reading verbatim from his lecture slides and doing practice problems already done in detail in the text. His accent is difficult to understand at times. Quizzes and tests are taken from the homework, and grading is generally lenient.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	2	Economics	407	5	5	5	1463497	11/2/12	Overall great guy. Test are based on practice exams. If you go to lectures, you won't have a problem
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	2	Economics	181	5	5	5	1463497	8/28/11	He knows the Economics, and his English isn't perfect but comprehensible. Great guy as a person, and he always sets the groundwork of basic economic principles. He only teaches the basics in very simple way, which I think is the best way to teach
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	0	Economics	480	3	1	1	1463497	5/4/11	Class was horrible. A waste of time. Class had 70ish students and by mid semester 10 would show up tops. He just blabbers on a lot and doesn't give much instruction on how to do things. He's understandable in conversation but when instructing there's definitely a communication barrier. Super nice guy - always smiling, approachable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	2	Economics	480	5	5	3	1463497	12/30/11	Tests are very simple as he always includes multiple questions from his review sheets. Really nice guy too. You should be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	0	Economics	480	2	3	1	1463497	5/5/11	Doesn't teach the subject matter. Had to teach everything to myself. Stopped going to class because he just confused me more. The exams are pretty easy as long as you know the material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sang-Yong OH	3.4	2	Economics	482	5	5	5	1463497	8/28/10	Awesome down to earth guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	3	5	2	397474	3/24/11	shes a mess. but she knows her calc and she is very nice and helpful. grade based on 4 exams (non-cum, 25% each) and homework(lots,25%) but she drops the lowest grade out of all 5. also there is no final during exam week. i usually teach myself with the book, but for people who need it, she will be glad to help. rec not required.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	2	4	3	397474	12/11/10	She was crazy at first. But I soon became very attached to her quirkiness. She teaches well, and her tests are hard, but fair. I am an average calc student, but I didn't have any trouble passing. She does curve,and her tests are medium to hard, but definitely fair. She lets you take a card into the exams. I recommend her a lot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	4	3	2	397474	8/9/10	Such a good professor. Gives a lot of homework and it is hard but the exams are easier after you do the homework. I would recommend her to anyone who hates or loves calc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	5	5	3	397474	4/20/10	Goes through examples in class which helps with homework and exams. Lecture goes in a decent pace and she will slow down if you ask. She's very organized with her colored markers and make entertaining noises. She assigns a decent amount of homework but it helps in the end. Tests are fairly easy but curves aren't as great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	142	3	3	4	397474	2/21/10	She really enjoys what she does. She's for the most part clear in lecture and uses a microphone. She'll slow down if you ask. Sometimes she'll make a mistake and freak out which can be pretty entertaining. The problem sets are huge and can take a while. If you can do the homework you won't have a problem on the tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	142	5	3	2	397474	12/30/09	Dr.Olsen does give alot of hw, but its worth doing all those hw, which the TA's at the math help center can help you out with. And your Homework grade can substitute your a test grade. Her tests are fairly easy compared to her Homework, but the best thing about her class is that she is a VERY VERY lenient grader. Got an A and didn;t deserve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	142	2	4	4	397474	12/15/08	She's very enthusiastic about math and she gets really excited when teaching it. She assigns graded homework once a week which takes a really long time to do. The exams are a lot easier than the homework, and she lets you use an index card as a cheat sheet. She's kind of crazy which makes it kind of interesting, but she's kind of hard to follow.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	142	1	2	1	397474	11/23/08	Olsen not an easy teacher. her lectures are not interesting. she makes some problems seem harder then they really are. her homework are long as hell. this is not the class for someone who does homework last minute. the homework are to long to do that and you have to turn your homework in. 90 percent of her notes come directly from the textbook.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	142	1	1	2	397474	5/24/07	Terrible lecture, extremely hard to follow and mostly useless. All of her examples are either irrelevant or taken exactly from the book. Homework is loooooong, very hard and graded. I used to spend 2-3 solid evenings (4PM-midnight) a week working on it. Tests however are pretty easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	4	4	3	397474	1/17/07	old lady, class is pretty boring - she just writes on the board and you've got to copy it. 25% of the grade each for 4 tests and 25% for weekly homework. Then drops the lowest grade of the 5. First few tests are easy so you can screw up a later test and still get an A. Better than most other 142 profs, apart from Busch probably.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	3	5	5	397474	1/19/11	Great teacher, she was crazy but in a good way. Does assign a lot of homework which is graded, but is very approachable and will explain anything you don't understand. You can bring an 3x5 index card filled with anything you want to exams and 2 cards for the final. I would recommend her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	5	5	5	397474	9/16/10	She's really not a bad professor. Assigns a lot of homework which is collected and graded but it helps in the long run. Tests aren't too bad. Would recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	3	397474	5/11/10	Everyone's been giving her bad ratings, but she's really not that bad. She makes a lot of random noises during class, but it gives the class entertainment. Her tests are actually quite easy, if you did the homeworks. The homeworks may take a lot of time to do, but it actually helps.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	1	4	3	397474	3/30/10	She is a great teacher and does not deserver her low rating. She teaches clearly abstract concepts and will fix mistakes she makes. She does give allot of homework, but that will help you learn the material and can act as a test grade. She puts allot of hard material in the first two weeks during drop add. test are curved. hard class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	141	3	3	4	397474	1/11/10	Olsen is a old lady that obviously knows her stuff. The only problem is that she will make a minor mistake in the notes, and carry it though-out the entire lecture. That means, all the notes are wrong, but don't worry, she'll catch it at the very end, and you'll be erasing or scribbling down the right stuff as fast as you can!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	142	3	2	4	397474	9/21/09	Unclear. She uses a microphone, but it doesn't really help. Doesn't explain things well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	2	5	2	397474	11/25/08	She's old and needs a mic in front of a pretty small class, uses overhead instead of chalkboard (bad for long math problems). Tests are hard but fair. She loves the subject and spent a lot of time helping me with material that wasn't even part of this course. That type of dedication is invaluable. If you want to actually learn she is a good one
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	4	5	2	397474	5/14/08	I guess people say she's not that great because of the long homeworks (DC++ will save you hours), but thats the mark of a good teacher that knows that calc 142 takes practice. Her exams are fairly do-able b/c you're allowed a formula card and she curves the grades too. Her rating I felt was extremely unfair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	2	4	3	397474	4/6/07	Gives tough, long homework, but tests are much easier: it helps if you do it earlier than the night before it's due. She's just a crazy old lady who loves math and talks to herself; there's just no way you CAN'T appreciate her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	4	3	5	397474	10/5/06	Olsen gives an unbelievable amount of homework and you'll end up being up to early hours of the morning trying to get it done, and some of the questions on the homework are ridiculously tough, but the tests are pretty easy and its probably an easy A if you're decent at calculus.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	241	3	1	2	397474	6/2/06	she's an old hunched over lady who teaches way too much into theory. She gives a lot of homework and the tests are a little lenghty. Overall there is ap retty decent curve and it's not too hard to get an A, but there are other teachers where it's MUCH easier to get an A then with this one. Take it with bloom or busch if u can
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	142	3	3	3	397474	4/20/06	She gives way too much homework. She knows her stuff however and is a good professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	142	2	1	1	397474	1/7/06	copys her not without explaining...talks to herself....is not there for her office hours.....critizes you when you ask for help correcting your test...soft voice....boring lecturer...and there has to be something wrong with her mentally
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	2	4	2	397474	12/4/05	Class is boring, although when she screws up its funny cause she gets flustered. she will slow down for you. she does not cover polar coordinates at all which become important in 241. loads of work but it ensures you know it. three tests and a cumulative in class final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	397474	11/7/05	I hate this claaaaasss!!!! omg.. she doesn't know what she's doing..i don't get anything in her class..she is the worst professor i've ever had for Math!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	1	Mathematics	142	3	3	3	397474	10/25/05	She is a rediculous teacher. She teaches all in theory and gives way too much homework without going over it. Then she takes the test questions from the homework and you're expected to know how to do all of it. She has a good curve but so does everyone else. Try and avoid her. She's also a nut job.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	3	4	4	397474	8/31/05	Kind of a crazy lady. Have to teach yourself a lot of the material. Fairly good teacher but can confuse you easily.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	3	397474	12/8/04	She can be very helpful one on one however, the proofs that she demonstrates can get rather confusing. Homework problems closely resemble test questions.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	141	2	1	4	397474	10/8/04	teaches in theory and very hard to understand. Makes simple problems seem like rocket science
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	431	2	1	1	397474	5/3/06	Lectures are boring, everything you need to do is just copy from the board. Too much of homework(if you don't have a lot of class-it is fine)Exams are hard, you have to learn completely everything from book, lectures, homework. At the end it is fine if you can study yourself a lot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	0	Mathematics	142	2	3	4	397474	2/6/06	teaches too much in theory, and doesn't explain the homework enough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	121	4	4	3	397474	1/4/06	go to class, she will take attendance...not a bad teacher...goes a little bit too much into theory, but just focus on homework assignments and you can easily ace the tests and get an A, test questions are the easiest examples from the homework. shes nutty, but doesnt detract from the class too much; actually makes it a little more interesting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	5	5	3	397474	11/17/05	She is a great professor. She can go kind of fast at times and the class can be boring, but thats not her fault. She will slow down and explain things when you ask her to. And as for not going over the homework, thats what recitation is for...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Catherine Olsen	3.0	2	Mathematics	241	5	5	3	397474	10/30/05	I love her teaching style. Its boring at times, but it can be really interesting when she derives all equation out and tries to explain it so you can do your homework.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kate Olson	2.5	1	Biology	402	4	3	5	1470507	1/17/12	the class was not hard at all. you have to keep up with your notes and look thru her chapters diagram and tables. It was helpful for the hourly exams and final exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kate Olson	2.5	0	Biology	507	5	2	5	1470507	8/22/10	She only knows what she read. She makes you read a book in which she wrote a chapter. If you point out something she said wrong in class, she doesn't take it with gratitude. In my opinion she is a person who keeps yesmen/women around and hates someone who make her see herself as she is. Some times all she does seems redundant. but her lab has got $
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johanna Oreskovic	2.0	0	Law		3	2	2	1697782	3/4/12	In the beginning of the year she was approachable, but as she continued to call us unprofessional for asking for clarification and help, most of the class became wary of going to her which in the end was probably negative for our grades. Nonetheless I (and others) feared that somehow in going to her, my professionalism grade would be lowered.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	1	Psychology	336	2	3	4	470175	3/11/13	The class is actually interesting, but he just left me uninterested in anything to do with developmental psych. He gives the statistics of grades and you'll wonder how the rest of the class is doing that good...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	336	3	2	4	470175	5/26/11	As long as you go to lecture and take good notes, the class isn't as hard as everyone makes it out to be. If you do the work, you will be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	0	Psychology	618	3	2	3	470175	5/8/11	not great at answering questions, lectures are sometimes uncoordinated with PPT
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	450	1	5	5	470175	5/13/08	it was a hard class but he really is a nice guy if you just ask for help. he's too smart for his own good and it can make you uncomfortable at first, but he's easy to talk to after a few times.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	1	Psychology	336	2	3	4	470175	1/9/08	Tests are impossible!!!! Very interesting material but tests are unreal!!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	450	3	4	4	470175	12/10/11	if you are genuinely considering research as a career or considering grad sch, you will find that this class will provide you with a strong foundation. Exams are difficult but not impossible. lecture attendance will make life a lot easier. very helpful if you are willing to look for him during office hours. learned the most from his assignments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	336	5	4	3	470175	5/9/11	I had Ostrov for Dev Psych. Easy class if you attend lecture and take notes. Most of the tests are based on lecture. Provides study guides prior to tests, so anything not in your lecture notes can be looked up in the textbook. Easy multiple choice tests. A few surprise "in class activities" which basically give you credit just for showing up.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	498	3	4	3	470175	12/10/10	He's a little intimidating but is very appreciative if you do the work that's expected of you.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	0	Psychology	336	2	1	3	470175	12/13/07	his tests are impossible! the review sheets and textbook are useless since they have nothing to do with the tests. it doesn't matter how hard you study, your still screwed
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	2	Psychology	336	3	5	4	470175	12/10/06	Dr. Ostrov is very familiar with the course material. It's important to go to class because there a few pop in-class activities. Tests are kind of hard but his notes are very thorough so if you study/go to class you should be ok. Also provides a review sheet. He takes the course seriously and expects students to do the same. learned a lot
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jamie Ostrov	3.5	0	Psychology	336	2	1	4	470175	12/27/05	Very unclear about exam content. Doesnt allow makeups even with legitimate excuse.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	2	Anthropology	217	2	4	4	343754	2/7/11	Took him for Warfare back in 1990 and not what I expected to learn but I did enjoy learning about the Yanomami and Zulu's. I teach some Anthropology classes part time at my local community college and I do refer to some of the stuff I did learn in his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	0	Anthropology	217218	3	3	2	343754	9/1/05	I disagreed with a lot of his theories... and his class is very irritating with all the pauses he makes. Luckily, he had good TAs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	2	Anthropology	217	3	5	5	343754	12/3/04	I never knew so much about warfare before. In fact, I'm surprised that such a liberal University would have a class like that. Dr. Otterbein does tend to go off on a tangent and start talking about his washing machine or start poking fun at the TA, but I learned a lot. Very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	0	Anthropology	218	3	1		343754	5/3/04	Needs to retire!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	1	Anthropology	217	4	2	2	343754	1/8/08	He was alright, kept rambling on about nonsensical stuff. Does an alright job at teaching, usually has good TA's to help you out. Wouldn't recommend him to someone looking for an elective, but if you are an Anthro major, it's kinda fun.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Keith Otterbein	3.6	2	Anthropology	218	4	5		343754	5/3/04	I think he does a good job explaining the material. He leaves room for discussion and makes the subject intersting because he clearly loves it himself. The class was not hard and was a pleasure to have in my schedule.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Otto	3.6	0	Philosophy	337	1	2	2	1323871	4/4/13	Let's start by saying I'm in the honor's college and had to drop this class. She treats this class like you're going for a degree in philosophy even though our section was for nursing students. The book was very wordy, and so were her quizzes. I would avoid her section of this class if you want anything close to an A for an intro class. Just awful!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Otto	3.6	2	Philosophy	300	4	4	4	1323871	1/30/13	She's nice, the class in itself is semi-difficult but she makes it easy. 11 quizzes, basically one once a week but she drops one, they are on the reading chapter she assigned. they're like a short answer or 5 questions. the book is semi confusing. only 2 exams that are basically just like the quizzes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Otto	3.6	2	Philosophy	337	3	4	3	1323871	3/5/13	She's friendly and tries to explain the readings. But the class in general just sucks. The textbook is super confusing and hard to understand. 11 quizzes and she drops 1. And only 2 exams. No chance for extra credit. And to get a solid A you need a 94.1 try to take with another professor.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nora  Owen	3.0	1	Languages	191	5	3	4	1780221	12/11/12	The class was easy but it moved fast. You have to attend class other wise you will be lost. She doesn't really respond to emails very well so that gets annoying. Communication gets difficult sometimes and you must sometimes write on paper to communicate. Easy A though if you go to class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	201	5	5	5	1019737	4/5/11	I wish he taught more upper level English classes! By far the most passionate professor I've had here. He makes anyone feel confident in their work and is willing to compromise with anyone. Easy A. TAKE HIM!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	201	5	5	5	1019737	5/18/10	This by far is one of the most lenient english professors in UB. If you need more time and revision on your essays, he'll give it to you. If you wanna A in his class, put a lot of effort and revision in your essays because he doesnt give out many and the last essay you write is a topic of your own so that's an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	201	5	5	4	1019737	12/4/08	Professor Owens is a very nice guy and easy going. Assignments are more than fair and are graded with relative ease, especially in comparison to other English professors in the department.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	101	5	5	5	1019737	6/30/10	Very nice and always willing to listen and compromise with his students. He's passionate about what he does and he cares a lot about his student's interests and participation. Loved him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	201	5	5	3	1019737	12/2/09	Professor Owens is a great teacher. If you enjoy a discussion based class definitely take 201 with him. He is an easy grader and the assignments are not terrible for an english class. Overall I really enjoyed attending this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Owens	5.0	2	English	201	4	5	4	1019737	11/22/08	Professor Owens is pretty easygoing and extremely helpful. The readings we do are interesting and socially relevant. The amount of work is reasonable and he is always available for help...especially via e-mail. Genuinely nice person and that shows through his teaching style. Try to get him for English 201 or whatever else he teaches!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Parunchana Pacharn	4.8	2	Accounting	306	5	4	4	771842	3/18/06	she teacehs the material in a very simplistic way...the quizzes are easy and she's really helpful...just dont expect to learn anything without showing up to class cos that's where it all lies!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Parunchana Pacharn	4.8	2	Accounting	306	5	5	5	771842	1/23/06	Pretty good professor. She explains clearly, and very helpful during the office hours. You should be all right if you understand the problems in class and homework. Open book Final exam, and one cheat cheat for each quize.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dimitris Pados	3.5	2	Engineering	615	2	5	5	1000810	10/23/09	highly technical stuffs
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	122	2	1	2	883885	8/16/09	Couldnt hear him the entire semester, he refused to speak up or use a microphone, and his accent doesnt help the cause.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	5	5	5	883885	2/13/09	HE IS VERY HELPFUL AND KIND. HE HAS LOT OF PATIENCE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR A PROFESSOR. I SUGGEST TO PREFR HIM ESPECIALLY IF ARE VERY POOR IN CALCULUS.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	142	3	5	5	883885	7/3/08	this teacher rocks, his office hours are very helpful and in class he uses proper and understandable english. his tests are difficult, but not difficult enough to make everyone flunk, so if you studied well, you will get it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	122	3	4	2	883885	5/16/08	This class takes up a lot of time, with studying for quizzes and tests and the mandatory homework (worth 20% of your grade). As long as you study for the tests (I just re-did some homework problems) the tests will be fairly easy.It's a pretty boring class though. Tracy Rommesser (sp?) would probably be the best way to go for calc2.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	122	4	4	5	883885	2/29/08	He speaks kind of low, but Palaparthi does not have a language barrier to any extent. You can definitely understand him. There's weekly quizzes and HW. Quizzes aren't bad at all, for the HW - just read the book... seriously, the sections are like 3 pages each and you will learn. Lecture follows the book. Exams are absolutely FAIR, if not easy-
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	115	4	2	1	883885	10/18/07	I hate how he writes in the chalkboard because I can't read anything. I think he takes math's simple concepts and he makes them more confusing and harder. His quizzes are easy and he has them every wed at the end of class. His exams are a bit rough. I wanted to choose a diff math teacher but he was the only one available
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	131	1	4	2	883885	4/29/07	Nice person and seems to try to be a good professor. Class doesn't seem hard until you get the tests. Not a lot of partial credit on test but the curves are very extreme and it's almost impossible to fail the course. Math Lab and Office hours are great and definitly needed for this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	142	5	5	5	883885	12/4/06	good teaching, definitely recommend him. very helpful office hours. gives reviews and practice tests. nice person.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	115	2	2	1	883885	8/29/06	You can't understand him at all. Find someone else, this class is a waste of time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	5	5	3	883885	5/15/09	Very Good teacher, Slight accent, but understandble. Shows Many Examples, and explains material very well. Excellent tests, no tricks involved. There is a curve, depending on how well the rest of the class does. Very approachable. Overall Best teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	2	4	3	883885	10/26/08	He may be a good teacher for math 122 but his expectations for 121 are waaay too high. His exams are at a much higher difficulty level than what he teaches. Take him for upper level math NOT 121.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	142	3	5	4	883885	6/12/08	Extremely helpful, great office hours, easy to understand. Overall a very nice person.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	122	2	2	4	883885	3/18/08	Seriously I would recommend Tracy R over him, even on her worst teaching day. Homework is mandatory and is 1/5th of your final grade. Difficult to understand, basically going to teach yourself to do math if you take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	122	2	2	3	883885	2/28/08	He's very good at reviewing concepts and gives relevant, thorough examples in class. One very important consideration though: UNLESS YOU'RE FROM INDIA, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING HIM. It took me 1/3 of a semester to learn to understand him, so finally I feel like I'm learning to a better potential.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	115	3	4	3	883885	10/10/07	Gives good descriptions for people who have no idea whats going on. HW is not required but seriously helps with the once a week quiz..Overall good professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	0	Mathematics	131	1	1	1	883885	3/7/07	worst math teacher ever. i had to drop the class. does not explain anything. He even walked out on our class for talking.. just got up and left. DO NOT TAKE HIM class average was a 27.% a 40% would get you a B. terrrible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sree-Krishna Palaparthi	3.4	2	Mathematics	115	4	5	5	883885	12/3/06	He is a nice teacher, makes the material easy to understand and very helpful during office hours. gives helpful reviews and practice exams. not sure what grade i will get but will recommend him for this class or any calc class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samuel Paley	4.0	2	Classics	210	4	4	2	210731	3/16/08	this guy is a great teacher. somewhat hard to pay attention if the class is early in the morning, but even with only going to half the classes the test was doable.. the textbook is VERY IMPORTANT as is the CD... all the test questions come straight from the cd and if you use it you will definitely get an A. very smart guy, knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samuel Paley	4.0	2	Classics		3	5	4	210731	3/30/05	This was one of the best professors I had. Old school lecture, but fine since they were thoroughly presented. His extensive language knowledge and archaeological experience are fascinating in themselves. ALWAYS took time to take questions. Because of his encouragement I pursued higher degree.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Liz Palmieri	2.8	0	Communication		1	1	1	114585	10/17/05	Liz was HORRIBLE. She not only didn't listen to me, but treated advisement as an assembly line - in and out quick, and wasn't nice at all. She suggested courses to me which were already FILLED and wanted me to finish gen eds immediately even though I had 2 years left. Not at all concerned about my double major, only what SHE wanted for me. I'm glad she's gone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Liz Palmieri	2.8	2	Communication	225	5	5	5	114585	9/5/05	I got a A in the class because I actually came. You can not pass the class if you don't go...trust me. But she's not here anymore, liz was a great person...

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Liz Palmieri	2.8	2	Communication	225	4	5	4	114585	1/13/05	If you go to her class and give it a chance the class is really easy. The only reason people would rate her badly is because they probably didn't really bother with the class. She has open book exams so as long as you take notes you'll do well. She's a great advisor too.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kristy Palumbo	2.9	0	Not Specified	212	4	1	4	850940	5/20/06	This woman was the WORST teacher I have ever had at UB. STAY AWAY FROM HER!! I have a 3.8 GPA but got a D in her class. I worked very hard, so that obviously demonstrates her incompetence. She even had 2 TAs and an assistant and still came up with a class that was nonsensical and useless. This woman should be barred from ever teaching again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Piyasuda Pangsapa	3.3	2	Women's Studies	247	4	5	4	277846	3/4/06	She will explain any questions you have and she knows her stuff and is passionate about it. If you are lazy and don't read, you will not like her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Piyasuda Pangsapa	3.3	0	Women's Studies		4	1	1	277846	9/21/05	Page by page through the readings...any questions on this page? Often couldn't answer questions about readings, very unprepared for class. I only learned from the book, not her. Unacceptable preparation for a 500 level class. This was disappointing and confusing as she really does seem interested in her topics and in teaching. I just don't think she knows how to teach.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Piyasuda Pangsapa	3.3	2	Women's Studies	247	3	5	4	277846	2/27/05	She really knows her stuff and is actually very interesting. Very helpful if you are confused

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	4	4	826639	12/20/12	This class is one of the easiest A's that i have ever received, but it was quite boring going to class at 8:30am twice a week. Although i believe he has the best intentions of getting the student ready for the real world, it got quite repetitive even with the speakers coming in most of the time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	5	826639	11/26/12	Class is an easy A. TAKE WHEN YOU ARE A FIRST SEMESTER JUNIOR otherwise this kind of stuff you'll have had to figure out already. They really should make this class one of the management prerequisites.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	3	4	826639	4/22/11	If you take this as a Senior it is a complete waste of time. This is pretty much a beginner intro to resume, cover letter, interviewing and getting an internship class. So once again sort of pointless, you'd expect senior business major to have these skills down The grading is hard but in the end it is an easy A if you just do the work and show up
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	0	Management	300	2	1	1	826639	4/7/11	Bring something to do in class because it is pointless. Even if you pay attention in class it will be hard to receive a A or B because they decide to grade all of the assignments very harsh. You need to revise your work ten to fifteen times to be in the running for an A. The only good part is there is no expensive text book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	4	4	4	826639	3/2/10	Class is interesting, and more useful than any other class required by the SOM. Unfortunately the school is doing us a disservice by only offering the class at 8:30am. If the school would offer the class later in the day the class would be much more useful for students. All i am gaining is the experience of waking up early like when i get a job
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	3	826639	10/25/09	Great class. Really teaches alot. Kind of tough to get an A but not impossible. Protip: take this class in the summer so you don't have to get up at 830.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	1	Management	300	5	1	1	826639	6/16/09	Get ready to not learn how to write a resume, and listen to nattering goofballs for hours upon hours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	1	826639	4/26/09	Easy A if u attend all the lectures. There's only 8:30 classes available though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	5	826639	12/9/08	Mike Paolini is amazing, the class teaches you tons of things about the job search, information that's pretty hard to get anywher else. Anyone who says this class is a waste of time has no clue, it just might be the most important class you take, IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO FIND A JOB!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	4	826639	11/5/07	The class itself is pretty much a waste of time, but attendance is mandatory to get an A so you have to get up for an 8:30am class every tues/thurs. If you go to class, and do the assignments which are super easy, you should get an A. Hes a pretty nice professor too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	5	826639	12/17/12	Mr. Paolini is a great Professor that works hard for the students' career. That said, take preferably before your senior year otherwise it's useless to you. Grading is a joke and you should be ashamed if you get less than an A-.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	2	826639	11/20/12	Class is definitely useful. You will learn some great things and hear some great people useful to your future success in the business world. It is also VERY easy to get an A. Attendance mandatory and assigned seating. Good luck he's super boring and you will need to keep occupied during lecture. His voice is also extremely irritating.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	301	5	4	4	826639	4/9/11	Grading is brutal!! But easy class. Attendance is very manditory. Usefull class. Teachers care about your future
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	4	3	826639	12/21/10	Good professor. His class can get extremely repetitive as the semester goes on. All in all, it is a useful class that can actually help you with interviewing, resume building, and important things along those lines.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	101	3	5	5	826639	1/13/10	Simply Amazing. Teacher and class. Mike is a great guy and is so helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	4	826639	6/24/09	Easily one of the best prof's I've ever had. He is very helpful and WANTS to help you! Class is very useful. Everyone who says the class/prof. is not helpful is just lazy or is going nowhere in life. Took over the summer and enjoyed hearing speakers. Great class, great teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	4	5	1	826639	4/27/09	as a prof he is nice & very helpful but as far as the class goes it sucks. very boring & complete waste of time. speakers just talk about why you should work for their company instead of the area they work in. TAs are also very picky on how you do the assignments. if its not done EXACTLY the way they tell you you will lose points. easy otherwise.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	4	5	2	826639	4/14/09	He is a good prof & very helpful. the class itself sucks tho. most of the speakers just talk about why you should work for their company instead of giving you a perspective of that field. class is pretty easy but pointless. assignments are also easy, but they are real tough grading the resume & cover letter.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	2	826639	11/30/08	teacher is very helpful.i stopped in a number of times for help on assignments and he was more than happy to help. Very busy, so if you need to see him make an appointment. Attenndance is mandatory, but other than that there's no reason not to get an A if you show up and do all the assignments. No textbook and material helps for real life.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Paolini	4.6	2	Management	300	5	5	4	826639	5/18/06	this guy is very helpful..he isn't really a professor..he just basically tells you about everything that the school has to offer as far as helping your career...the class isn't hard..but it sucks that you actually have to go to class every MORNING (at 8:30)..because each class is worth 5 pts
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matt Owcarz	3.5	1	Not Specified	510	5	1	1	1072385	6/6/08	Worst teacher of all time. His class is as easy as 1st grade and he doesn't teach because he reads straight out of his made up slides.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matt Owcarz	3.5	2	Not Specified	509	4	5	5	1072385	12/11/07	cool guy once he figured out what he was doing (1st year teaching)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bradley Owens	5.0	2	Business	301	5	5	4	1670643	12/20/12	His class was really easy and kind of interesting. In order to get an A all you had to do was show up for the pop quizzes, look through the notes before a test, and complete the group project. If you do these its an easy A. And Brad is a really cool and chill professor that is really lenient.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bradley Owens	5.0	2	Business	301	5	5	4	1670643	5/3/12	Defiantly take this professor if you have the opportunity. Tests were difficult, but he gave tons of extra credit and curves heavily towards everyone's benefit. Great in class activities, such a fun class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bradley Owens	5.0	2	Business	301	4	5	5	1670643	10/21/12	Brad Owens is the man. His class is fun, interesting, and he has a passion for what he does. He loves teaching and it shows in the classroom. Exams are difficult, but it is a 300-level course. Fun in-class activities and a good curve. Take him! One of my favorite professors in the School of Management.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bradley Owens	5.0	2	Business	301	5	5	5	1670643	1/30/12	Best class i took, it was really fun and really easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	504	3	4	5	623619	2/11/11	Dr. Pack is adorable, and very friendly. Most importantly, though...ADORABLE!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	400	2	4	5	623619	4/30/09	This isn't one of those UGC ratings where I cry about having to do work. If you're actually interested in History, He's a great teacher. Somewhat challenging reading and writing assignments, but discussion and instruction is at a high level. Recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	112	4	4	5	623619	12/21/06	different but refreshing approach to teaching world civ. no textbook, just 5 short books to read. grades based entirely on performance in recitation. 4 responses plus 3 tests, of which the best 6 scores count. interesting class, but def depends on your TA. chad was awesome (:
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	112	4	4	1	623619	12/8/06	Took a little while to get used to how young he looks but all and all he wasn't bad. No text, no slides, and what you get basically depends upon your TA and how they are going to grade you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	1	History	000	3	2	3	623619	10/19/06	Decent/average.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	305	2	4	5	623619	9/29/06	Definitely worth your time and effort, but you'll have to make some. Very professional in the classroom, certainly no Doogie Howser.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	1	History	112	3	3	3	623619	5/4/06	I haven't had him yet... just wondering... HAS ANYBODY HAD HIM FOR UGC112? Thanks!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	331305	4	5	5	623619	9/22/05	Great professor, very clear and structured lectures, not too much work doesn't make you read alot. I highly suggest you try one of his courses.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	338	3	5	3	623619	10/21/09	He takes time to explain exactly what he means, and lectures in a "Stream of consciousness," sort of style, doesn't just read off notes. He is very receptive to questions, and loves when you join in discussions. I think he's a fairly easy grader... not sure, haven't gotten anything back yet! Make sure you go to class. He's adorable :-)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	0	History	112	2	1	4	623619	8/26/07	this guy is the worst professor i've ever had. he's like talking to a wall; a wall that stutters. He is never clear or concise about anything he speaks on. His class is a waste of time. If you have no choice pray you get a good TA they decide your grade anyway.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	112	4	5	2	623619	12/19/06	I had a really good experience with this professor. It's not your typical "easy A" world civ, but it's definitely not too hard and it's very fair. No textbook, just use wikipedia to get all your answers. Yeah, he does look young, but he's also kinda cute! (in a nerdy kinda way)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	0	History	112	2	1	1	623619	10/30/06	Pretty bad. No slides in class, no textbook either. Just 50 minutes of listening to him lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	305	2	4	5	623619	9/29/06	Check it out, work hard, learn plenty.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	1	History		3	3	4	623619	5/20/06	Not a bad guy, decent teacher, nothing outstanding by any means. Most of the students look older than he is. I'd card him if I worked at a liquor store. Doogie Howser?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	2	History	295	4	4	3	623619	11/1/05	real nice guy but you need to write alot of notes and go to class in order to do well. Took him for modern spain class- not too much serious reading but notes from class will be the most important when writing essays. Pretty easy grader as long as you attend class you will do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sasha Pack	3.5	1	History		3	3	3	623619	5/21/05	Has anyone taken this guy for anything yet? What's he like?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	George Page	1.5	0	Urban & Regional Planning	301	1	1	5	1713246	4/23/12	He devoted almost half of his class to work that was unrelated to the course. his project is laughable. the opinion papers he assign have ridiculous expectations. Gave me a poor grade for using the words very, wasn't and however. underneath my grade he wrote "good paper, well thought out. his quizzes are incredibly difficult. good luck.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joe Palencik	2.4	2	Philosophy	337	5	4	2	931474	10/16/07	Easy class...thou material is a bit dry he makes understanding it easy. Just do weekly assignments and study the handouts before exam and you'll do fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joe Palencik	2.4	0	Philosophy	337	1	1	5	931474	5/11/07	STAY AWAY. I got 100s on EVERY paper and Bs on tests, and got a C in the class! Take Hershenov instead, take ANYONE instead.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joe Palencik	2.4	2	Philosophy	111	5	5	4	931474	1/3/07	Very informative teacher. Helps with professors guidelines and makes class fun, no matter how boring the material. Throws in a philosophical twist to go along with history, a cool combo. Do the work and its an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joe Palencik	2.4	0	Philosophy	337	1	1	4	931474	5/18/07	jerk. has no grading policy and is fails you anyway. you'll get 2 letter grades below what you really deserve. if you can't take anyone else, don't take the class. you'll regret it.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephen Paling	4.5	2	Library Science		2	4	4	267395	12/7/04	Cute. Excellent teacher. Especially at night. Makes the time go fast. Very energetic. A great new addition to the program.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephen Paling	4.5	2	Library Science		3	5		267395	10/24/03	Lots of enthusiasm. Gobbles candy during evening class and bounces around like a ping-pong ball. Knows his stuff. Cute, too. :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stephen Paling	4.5	2	Library Science	571	3	5		267395	6/8/04	Sweet, smart, helpful, and a total cutie!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Palmisano	4.6	2	Psychology	689	3	5	5	1317016	3/26/12	She is fun and has a lot of clinical experience. We learn more from her than other professors with no practical experience who just talk endlessly about their research or use the instructor's manuals.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Palmisano	4.6	2	Psychology	644	2	5	5	1317016	2/19/12	Really knows what she is talking about!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Palmisano	4.6	2	Psychology	644	3	5	5	1317016	3/17/12	If I could take every class with Dr. Palmisano, I would. She embodies what I believe to be an exceptional counselor and counselor educator!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christy Panagakis	5.0	2	Sociology	335	3	5	5	1416815	3/18/10	The best!!! A great professor, very helpful, fun, relaxed, and teaches a great course. Definitely one of the best I've had at UB!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	1	1	3	470550	11/29/06	Was completely unable to explain anything with any clairity. Would often mess up in the middle of an example and have to start over. You would have better luck trying to learn the material on your own. She seemed like a nice enough person though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	1	Mathematics	141	2	4	4	470550	8/17/05	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	1	2	4	470550	1/19/05	Terrible...absolutely terrible
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	1	1	3	470550	12/30/04	This class was really, really bad because she never ansewers your question and sometimes she even gets made when you ask them. In addition she feels the need to show a proof for everthing and I mean everthing. Even the simplest problem
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	2	2	3	470550	11/21/04	horrible teacher! avoid if at all possible. straight from Italy and can't speak english. makes things so much harder than they need to be. good luck passing...most kids in the class had to resign
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	3	1	4	470550	10/11/04	She has a horrible accent and can't speak well. She makes every topic much harder than it has to be and over explains everything in the wrong ways.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	306	1	1	1	470550	5/3/05	Horrible, everything MTH141 people say is true....she is very defensive about her teaching and made a girl cry
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	1	2	3	470550	1/19/05	nice person, but bad teacher. Math came easy to me until now. However, she does a huge curve at the end of the year bc everyone does bad
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	1	Mathematics	141	4	4	4	470550	12/16/04	Simona is way too smart to be teaching calc 1. She tries to teach, but teaching is definitely not her gift; she would be better off in research only. Her accent is confusing the first couple of weeks but it's something that one gets accustomed to fairly early. Don't take Paoli.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Simona Paoli	1.5	0	Mathematics	141	3	2	3	470550	11/9/04	The best part of that class was watching my friend crawl out the front door without Paoli seeing. I titled the movie: The Great Escape. Actually he did, yea and Paoli is terrible, WAY too smart to teach, avoid if possible!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stefanos Papazaharias	4.8	2	Languages	191	4	5	5	1026594	10/12/11	I would highly reccomend this class to anyone who needs to fulfill their language requirement. Papazaharias is a wonderful instructor who truly loves his language. Attendance is mandatory, but going to this class is fun, why would you want to miss anyway??
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stefanos Papazaharias	4.8	2	Languages	191	2	5	5	1026594	2/25/08	Really good class if you want to learn a language. Not only does he teach you the formals, he also makes you knowledgeable on certain terms/subjects just in case you ever visit the country. Attendance is mandatory but you get 3 absences with grace, only a written midterm and a written/oral final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Paquet	3.2	2	Engineering	420	2	5	4	788141	12/8/10	Class expectations very clear- posts grading rubrics for all labs so at least if you follow those you should not get below a B or C. Fair with grading, some said unfair with amount of work given. As long as you pace yourself you're fine :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Paquet	3.2	2	Engineering	424441	1	3	2	788141	12/23/05	Put in A level work, and get a B/B-, wait till last minute to do your assignments, and somehow end up with B+/A-. No curving. He thinks that a B is a good grade, which might be fine for an average student, but if you're shooting for A's, this guy can really screw you over.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Paquet	3.2	0	Engineering	541	4	1	2	788141	7/13/08	never care about student and late for school. He should be kicked out from department.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jiyoung  Park	2.0	0	Urban & Regional Planning	538	4	2	2	1807142	4/8/13	Park's English is better than some of the international teachers but can pose a definite problem in understanding. He goes on tangents throughout the course which make it difficult to sty interested and following the class. Everything is groupwork which is impossible for graduate students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Parker	4.8	2	Medicine	252	5	5	3	795922	12/9/06	If none of the honors seminars cover any requirments for you, then this is the one you should request. It's only 2 hours or less (even though the schedule says 3) and as long as you show up everyday you get an A. At least it's a GPA boost guaruntee. Some speakers were intresting, the rest-not so much.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Parker	4.8	2	Medicine	252	5	4	2	795922	1/10/06	Pointless class were you do not work, but an easy A. Some of the lectures were interesting, but most were boring due to the speakers he selected. Overall, an easy but boring honors seminer selection!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	1	Mathematics	148	3	3	3	1446768	12/10/12	She isn't awful but she isn't the best. She goes through material quickly and a lot of times the problems that are in our notebooks aren't correct. She does offer to help you however. She does not always review before the quizzes and if she does the questions she gives are not always the same as she puts on test.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	0	Mathematics	148	1	1	1	1446768	12/9/12	HORRIBLE. Doesn't test you on anything she goes over. I learned everything from reading the textbook on my own. I wouldn't reccomend her to anything she is just an awful teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1446768	10/13/12	She simply cannot teach. tests us on information nor related to her notes. Don't take her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1446768	9/14/12	she is so unclear, never explain anything always tells every body to trust her without telling us where she got the solution from
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	1	Mathematics	147	4	3	1	1446768	12/23/11	Parks is a very boring teacher. She seem to be confuse at times and non sure of herself. She gives hw from the text up but does not check it fully.Her exams and simialr questions from the textbook.She does not give lots of extra credit.Final is option depending. She ok overall.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	2	Mathematics	147	5	4	4	1446768	12/9/12	A clear professor, totally recommended drops lowest quizzes and homework. If you do exactly what you're supposed to do (submit homework on time- study) you will get a good grade. Attend each class, be on time you'll be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	2	Mathematics	121	5	5	3	1446768	10/25/12	Leya is an excellent instructor and easy to contact for assistance. Exams and quizzes are easy enough if you put in a conscious effort to the work assigned.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1446768	10/7/12	She can't teach. Her notes are so i watered down and irrelevant to her exams. She tests on minuscule concept that has nothing to do with calculus. Don't take her class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	2	Mathematics	147	3	4	3	1446768	12/23/11	She's a very helpful teacher and you can pass by doing homework and passing her test with at least average. She give unexpectedly quizzes. Final is optional and attendance is mandatory.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Leya Parks	3.0	2	Mathematics	142	5	5	3	1446768	11/1/10	EXTREMELY HELPFUL!!!!! Best professor I've had at UB. Very Clear, great examples, Young, and Does NOT put you to sleep. Easy A which is hard to find for this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science	000	2	5	5	802406	8/15/07	Very intelligent woman with a great sense of humor. Take her courses and you wont regret it!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science	303	5	4	3	802406	12/23/06	If you wanna get a good grade in Constitutional Law, I highly recommend this professor. She has a great sense of humor, is extremely helpful, and doesn't pack in too much reading. Always go to class though, because most of the essential material is presented via powerpoint presentations. I hate political science, but ended up with an A here!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science	215	5	5	5	802406	7/18/06	awesome teacher, even explained things from a higher level psc class where the professor was not helpful, sighned up for her class again
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	0	Political Science		5	1	1	802406	5/10/06	mean, miserable, no sense of humor. Did I mention mean?
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science	303	4	5	5	802406	2/26/07	Great teacher for this course. She knows everything very well. She can recite parts of the constitution word for word.....brilliant. She is really nice to talk to if you have questions. Also had her for PSC 215, she is a great teacher to take.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science		2	4	5	802406	8/7/06	Very smart woman. Packs too much material into class notes and class notes are only form of communication with her. Intersting class though...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lisa Parshall	4.1	2	Political Science		5	5	5	802406	6/19/06	Tough, great, DEDICATED. I wish all my profs were like her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cheri Pascoe	5.0	2	Mathematics	147	4	5	3	1743969	11/8/12	She is a good teacher. She will help you if she sees that you are willing to take an initiative and actually care about your grades and doing well. Be respectful to her, show her your ambitious and always do your homework.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cheri Pascoe	5.0	2	Mathematics	147	2	5	1	1743969	8/25/12	Mrs. Pascoe kicked my butt in this class, but it's only because she cares. She's really clear and good at what she teaches but don't expect to get by just by showing up or being her friend. She makes time for every student as long as they're willing to give time back. Textbook is mandatory for homework,quizzes and test given regularly,be prepared!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Abani Patra	3.1	2	Engineering	529	4	5	4	443910	12/3/12	He is very good professor. He speaks very precise. Once you start understanding his teaching you really enjoy attending his lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Abani Patra	3.1	0	Engineering	376	1	1	2	443910	4/20/11	He is quite honestly the worst professor. Very unorganized, late all the time, unprofessional. He may be good at teaching grad courses but not undergrad. Does not arrive at any point during class at all. Learned everything I have previously learned in Linear Algebra. Very pretentious and arrogant.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Abani Patra	3.1	0	Engineering	541	3	2		443910	8/11/04	He has lost interest in reserach or teaching he has lost the energy it is very sad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Abani Patra	3.1	2	Engineering	541	3	5	2	443910	11/4/11	He is a good prof overall
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Abani Patra	3.1	2	Engineering	660	2	4	5	443910	8/27/09	As a grad student you want him for an advisor. He's at the top of his field (currently on sabbatical to be Program Director for the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, NSF Washington, DC). He looks after his students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	500	2	3	4	1469670	1/14/11	Good Professor. Clear. Waay too much reading. Alpha female classroom personality. Will allow you to crash and burn. Plays favorites!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	500	3	5	5	1469670	10/22/10	Professor Patterson is awesome. She only has one two books and the assignments are fair. She's a fair grader as well. She's one of those professors that make you feel like she really cares about your education. She's down to earth and informative. You will learn alot in her class, and she makes the lectures interesting!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	3	5	4	1469670	12/26/07	Great teacher! I had a class of 250 kids and she still managed to keep up great class discussions that some professors can't achieve in a class of 15 or 20. As long as you pay attention in class, the quizzes and tests are pretty easy. I would definitely recommend taking her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	3	5	5	1469670	12/2/07	GREAT TEACHER! I LOVE HER!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	4	4	5	1469670	10/8/07	Don't read the textbook, don't even buy it. If you just take good notes the tests are easy. I'm comfortable participating in class despite the size. I have already read a lot about urban planning and have found my extremely easy AP Human Geography class to be helpful in understanding the concepts presented.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	5	5	5	1469670	11/19/04	Probably one of the best teachers ever! We hardly have to do any of the actual reading in order to pass an exam or quiz; we just have to show up in class and take notes.We cover topics that have interested me long before I became a college freshman. This is one of the best classes I've ever had!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	1	Social Work	120	3	2	3	1469670	10/17/04	May as well be call AAH101 (African American History 101). She spends a week or two on general society and interesting topics then talks about nothing but African Americans and society. Videos are good and class is not too hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	4	5		1469670	8/18/04	Don't buy the book. Take notes in class even though they are offered online. It'll help on the tests. This was one of the only classes where I felt comfortable enough to participate in a class discussion with 150+ students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	4	4		1469670	10/8/03	simple concepts presented in an open discussion class, with fair tests, no attendance taken
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	500	5	5	3	1469670	11/13/10	Love her! She is hands down one of my favorite professors. She is very helpful and actually cares about the students. You would think a history and policy class would be boring but she makes it interesting and theres lots of discussion. Her assignments are not difficult. Highly recommend her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	500	3	4	4	1469670	9/2/09	She is now teaching Social Work. Should be listed under Social Work department, not architecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	5	5	4	1469670	12/9/07	Amazing professor. Class was a JOKE. She puts the notes on UB Learns along with the readings, which you do not even need. She also assigns readings which are summarized in the notes, therefore, you do not need to do them. Also there are pop quizues or attendance checks which if you are in class for are extreamly easy and can boost ur grade. Easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	4	5	5	1469670	11/4/07	really helpful and hot! class is so interesting and not too difficult. definitely recommend!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	0	Social Work	120	5	1	2	1469670	9/14/05	This class was really easy, but extremely boring and unnecessary. The bulk of the material is right from the text, so there is really no reason to go to class at all. If you are looking for an easy A, this class is it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	4	4	3	1469670	11/4/04	Good teacher, don't really need the book. Class if fairly interesting, but she does focus too much on African American studies, but that is her research focus so what are ya gonna do. Has random attendance checks, but the tests are not difficult if you just study the notes she puts online.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	2	5	5	1469670	10/13/04	very clear and to the point,always have a intro to a topic with something interesting that we can relate to.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kelly Patterson	4.4	2	Social Work	120	5	5		1469670	12/11/03	Wonderful professor. Provides many different points of view on every topic.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	2	English	261	4	5	4	356240	7/19/07	Took two of her class because I am loving the way she teaches. She is amazing at how she transmits what she knows without making it hard for the students to understand. Again some did not like here energy and passion because they prefer a more sleepy learning environment. One of the teachers that left a mark and will remember her for many years to
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	1	English	201	4	3	1	356240	5/2/05	She tried her best to teach but no one really wanted to learn.. Id say if you want to learn you will but if you choose not to you can still get by with an A. Everyhting goes by the sylaboos.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	2	English	191	5	5	4	356240	11/22/04	AMAZING TEACHER!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	0	English	256	1	2		356240	7/25/04	Be careful here. Looks like an easy course, and you are lulled into thinking you are doing well with very simple quizzes. The bulk of your grade rests on the final paper. After the course is over, you check your grade on SOAR, and get a big surprise.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	1	English	359	3	3		356240	3/25/04	Childrens Literature. Also teaches Film course ENG 256.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	2	English	256	3	5	4	356240	7/19/07	Great teacher, friendly, fun, dedicated, very comprehensible. She managed to get students involved by promoting active participation. Some were unhappy because they did not really want to learn and she disturbed their sleep!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	1	English	261	3	3	5	356240	4/1/05	Would have failed her own class according to her attendance policy, then tried to insist that we have make-up classes during our free time. Never gave the class any way to gage how well they were doing. It seemed like easy stuff, but somehow most people ended up doing worse than expected.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	2	English	256	5	5	4	356240	11/5/04	She's awesome and tries to make class fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chrysavgi Papagianni	4.0	2	English	191	5	5		356240	4/19/04	She's great! Very energetic, has a passion for teaching and tries to makes class fun
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	2	Ethnic Studies	254	4	5	5	92309	3/19/13	He has knowledge in his head, ,he wants us to do the same. I love how interested he is in class discussion. He seems to be wilting in age, but all he needs a little sunshine and water.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	0000	5	1	1	92309	3/21/12	Do not take any classes with this professor... I could go on for days about how awful of a teacher he was but I will just give you a question he gave us on our final exam. What company was advertised in the background of one of the scenes in a movie we watched.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	4	1	1	92309	6/29/10	This was the worst class I have ever taken. The content was offensive, yet the class was entitled "american pluralism". We watched films that were supposed to depict ethnic or racial groups accurately, but instead, just lumped a bunch of stereotypes together. His teaching style is a result of either his tenure status, or of doing too many drugs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	5	2	1	92309	10/26/05	Nobody should complain about the easiest grade at UB
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	1	Ethnic Studies	211	3	3	2	92309	12/11/04	Felt the class wasnt leaning so much toward "American Pluralism" as much as toward "WTF". the films are quite random, and he does not a good of syaing how they relate to perpose of the course. he assigns a very long, dense reading that he tests on, but does not discuss at all in class !!, LAME

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	3	1	3	92309	10/13/04	Never take this course with him if you want it to make any sense at all. Worst professor I've had at UB and I've been here 4 years.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	3	1		92309	3/29/04	Cannot spell, let alone teach. Can't accurately judge easiness, because he is far too incompetent to grade scantrons in less than a month.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	1	Ethnic Studies	211	3	2		92309	2/22/03	He needs to put some life into his teaching.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	254	2	1	2	92309	5/19/12	CALLING HIM THE WORST TEACHER EVER WORLD BE AND UNDERSTATEMENT...I took his "Black Films" class. With a name like that you would expect it to be an easy A or B...WRONG you watch a lot of bad movies, he never explains or tells you why you got the grade you got and he never responds or answers any questoins.I WILL NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM AGAIN
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	2	Ethnic Studies	253	5	5	1	92309	1/23/12	For Blacks In Films 1 he was a great teacher. The films were interesting and he's a great guy to go into his office hours and have a chat with. I'm a white freshman kid who thought the class would cover a gen ed, but it didn't. However I enjoyed it so much I'm taking the second part of the class this semester. He's a great teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	1	1	1	92309	12/14/05	WORST TEACHER EVER... HE Told us our midterm was going to be 25 questions from movies we watched in every class and 25 questions from the book we never discussed and it somehow turned into 95 questions on the book and 5 questions on the 8 movies we watched... When asked why did you tell us it was 50% of each he responded.....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pappas	1.9	0	Ethnic Studies	211	3	1	2	92309	1/13/05	don't even bother...

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	2	English	101	3	4	3	246047	12/11/04	Ms. Park is a nice teacher but hard to understand at times. She is very willing to help students. There is a good amount of work for this class but it is like that for most of ENG 101 classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	0	English	101	4	1		246047	7/19/04	Awful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	2	English	317	4	5		246047	4/21/04	Great Professor!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	2	English	101	4	5		246047	10/27/03	Understanding Teacher who helps you if you ask for it...Great Teacher!! Besides theres too much on cultural literacy!! If you dont like Cultural literacy dont take the class!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	1	English	101	3	3	3	246047	1/3/05	u can tell shes smart but the class is a joke. 5 essays a semester, need to go to class, and is very hard to understand..without the kids in my class who kept us laughing i would of died.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	0	English	101	3	1		246047	7/22/04	I wasn't suprised to see that she was infact from the Korean department. She can't speak English, much less teach it. She's awful, and her class is a joke, except when your grades come in.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	2	English	201	3	4		246047	7/18/04	She's not very clear with her instructions but she's tries to help her students. Nice lady.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	1	English	201	2	3		246047	4/9/04	Thanks to the previous two students, u guys ruin my GPA by introducing me this instructor! Most of my classmates dun like her.so... think before u take her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Hajeong Park	3.2	2	English	101	4	5		246047	9/5/03	She is an extremely patient woman that happens to be very nice, and helpful. Excellent for starting out in English 101/Writing 1
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	411	3	4	4	1530889	12/16/11	Great professor! Grades are based on 3 exams, two short papers, attendance and weekly discussion question posts on ublearns. Some of the information isn't the most interesting but she keeps class fun. I would reccommend her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	411	5	4	5	1530889	3/31/10	Great teacher, interesting class. 3 exams, no final. No extra credit. Attendance mandatory. 2 essays, 10 online discussion questions based off of lecture or reading (your choice). Overall not very difficult. Encourages class discussion. Only minor complaint is that the review sheet she provides prior to exams tends to leave out things on exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	411	3	5	2	1530889	10/4/06	Very intelligent professor. The work load can get to be a bit but it is a 411 level class. Very good at giving notes and relaying the information. Will work to accomadate and problems. Do the work and you will be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	331	5	5	5	1530889	5/7/06	WELL, GUYS 331 IS MORE COMMON SENSE IF YOU HAVE COMMON SENSE YOU CAN LEARN THE LECTURES....I THINK SHE WAS WONDERFUL TEACHERS...REPLIED TO MY EMAILS SOME PROFESSORS DON'T REALLY CARE........PLUS I THINK ITS NOT ABOUT GETTING AN A its about how interested you are in social psychology...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	0	Psychology	411	2	1	1	1530889	4/25/06	completely useless. noone i know likes the class. she likes group projects
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	411	3	5	4	1530889	9/23/11	great synthesis of concepts. fair tests, fun class time. very cute.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	411	5	4	5	1530889	10/30/08	Very lenient and understanding professor, probably because shes still relatively young. Lots of material, but she puts it into context so studying isn't that hard as long as you pay attention in class. One of the more interesting classes I have taken in my college career. I just wish she taught more classes! Recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	331	3	5	5	1530889	8/30/06	Awesome teacher. Everything she taught was relative. The online stuff wasn't helpful. I was pretty sure I was going to fail the exams when I used it, but the actual exams were really fair. She uses a lot of examples and really wants her students to succeed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	2	Psychology	331	3	4	3	1530889	4/28/06	I'm not sure about self and self-esteem... but social psychology was good with her, she had a ton of examples to give, so it wasn't just straight lecture all the time...she really likes video clips...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lora Park Bunting	4.2	1	Psychology	411	2	3	4	1530889	4/18/06	Boring. Class not worth the trouble, professor really not that good. I didn't learn a damn thing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Parker	4.7	2	Fine Arts	135	5	5	3	822836	1/26/12	Awesome teacher! Easy grader, and is very chill. The only thing he real y gets mad at is if you are disrespectful or continually late to his class.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Parker	4.7	2	Fine Arts	140	3	4	3	822836	3/17/10	Parker was cool so long as you took class seriously and put effort in. He really has no time for slackers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing		2	5	1	1330059	1/6/13	I really enjoyed his class, he's a little ambiguous in his instructions and what he actually expects (but very fair), doesn't give examples of essays but he will answer any question you have to the best of his ability and is always willing to meet with you. This is not the class for any easy A. He loves class discussions and he is truly a nice guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	102	2	4	4	1330059	12/26/12	Where do I even begin? First of all, the class discussions are interesting. BUT if you decide to choose the class, just know you're at risk of getting a poor grade. He grades very harshly, and often contradicts himself. Overall he's a good guy with a terrible grading policy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	102	1	4	3	1330059	12/5/12	Class is somewhat interesting, but grades way too harshly. If you can, go somewhere else.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	201	4	4	2	1330059	4/12/11	Most likely my favorite teacher that I've had here at UB. I was dreading taking this class, but Dustin made it interesting, and picked material relevant to today's society. He is very open, kind, always available for outside meetings, and is very passionate about English. While his teaching style is unorthodox, I STRONGLY recommended him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	101	1	5	5	1330059	12/26/10	Damn he keeps on saying grades are not important. so what is important? makes class interesting but gets boring along the way.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	101	1	4	4	1330059	12/16/10	Not what I had anticipated. Grades harshly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	0	Writing	102	1	2	4	1330059	1/4/13	Great guy. Interesting professor. However his grading leaves much to be desired. Contradicts himself a lot, and doesn't grade fairly in my opinion but class discussions are interesting. Paper topics are thought provoking and interesting however, you run the risk of doing bad. On the 1st paper most kids got a grade of C or lower.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	0	Writing	102	1	3	3	1330059	12/22/12	This guy is terrible. He makes no sense and gives awful grades. Everything you read all year is messed up and sick. Once gave the entire class C's and D's on a paper too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	201	3	4	4	1330059	4/19/11	Well, not the best teacher I ever come across but not bad. Take him if you like class discussions otherwise it's a disaster for you. Weird teaching style but gotta give it to him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Dustin Parrott	3.9	2	Writing	101	1	5	5	1330059	12/28/10	Good class

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kathleen Parzych	4.0	2	Fine Arts	210	5	4	5	1642270	11/10/11	I had her for the introductory photography class. I enjoyed the class a lot. It's a 3 hour class 2 days a week but most days we left early. She's quirky and very much an artist. But she knows what she's talking about. I would seriously recommend her to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	1	Law		3	4	2	1551091	2/6/13	All around great guy. Just ask him to clarify something and he will. If you are a decent writer you will do well in his class. He is confusing at times with what he wants you to actually do, but he will always answer questions. He lets us call him by first name, and acts like your buddy. Just don't take advantage or piss him off.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	2	Law		5	5	3	1551091	10/27/12	Good guy. Easy grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	2	Law		3	5	5	1551091	4/19/11	He is by far the most caring prof I?ve had in law school.LAWR is subjective,which frustrates students. Yes, there is ambiguity in the classroom,but so will there be in court!His strongest quality is his open door policy.When your 35 pg paper is due,he offers to go through it line by line with you.Your grade is truly based on the effort you put in.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	0	Law	515	2	2	2	1551091	3/21/11	Seems to mean well but over-exerts the class by assigning more work than is actually covered in class. There are a lot of superfluous reading (e.g. articles) and is extremely disorganized. Also has a lot of typos/contradictory information.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	2	Law		5	5	2	1551091	11/13/12	Class is a lot of work and he does nitpick about formatting and grammar. But he gives out a lot of examples and will always meet with you. Sometimes is a little dry but he is a fair grader and he wants you to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	0	Law		2	3	3	1551091	7/18/11	This guy is straight out of a movie. Overly intense in class to a point that cannot be justified. Literally almost fought a student in his office. Clearly cares about teaching writing skills but is awful at communicating. Class mainly consists of pointless arguing over opinions. Stay off his bad side to get at least a B+ and go see him to do better
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Chris Pashler	3.1	0	Law		3	1	2	1551091	4/7/11	I'm pretty sure he wouldn't give himself on A on a paper. Impossible to figure out what he wants. Hard to hear. Instructions are often contradictory/ambiguous. You will be shooting in the dark trying to figure out what to do. Does seem to mean well, but his lack of organization and his excuse-making do not help. Too bad you can't pick LAWR profs...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	2	Social Work	560	1	5	3	1108643	11/21/10	Great teacher and great person. I learned for others Prof Patterson failed several students for cheating. I am glad to know there are profs who will set standards high and hold students accountable although it is harder on us. Keeps it up and don't worry about the neg statements posted. One can guess why!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	2	Social Work	560	1	5	3	1108643	5/2/10	Great professor -- as one can tell from these reviews, professor Patterson seems to upset low quality students.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	0	Social Work	560	3	1	5	1108643	10/27/10	Mr. Patterson provided no feedback on graded assignments. After many students complained his TA's provided minimal feedback on research papers. Not flexible to student concerns, (as another review stated "condescending"). Syllabus and email correspondence loaded with grammatical errors- academic rigor suspect. Worst professor ever! Avoid him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	0	Social Work	560	3	1	4	1108643	4/26/10	Professor Patterson is the worst professor I have ever had. He does not review work or assist you when needed. If you can - AVOID his classes.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	2	Social Work	550	2	5	4	1108643	4/8/10	Great professor, down to earth and respectful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	D A Patterson	3.8	2	Social Work	560	2	2	4	1108643	3/26/10	Professor Patterson has very high standards and really cares about the subject he teaches. He is the only professor I have ever had who holds students accountable. A great professor if you like high standards. You will not like his style and class if you try to BS your way through, which is typcial of many of my peers. Hard class but will learn.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Diana Pehlic	3.5	2	Social Science	213	5	5	5	1578720	10/14/11	Superb instructer, class is very well organized, she is always prepared. Lectures are available online, syllabus is crystal clear on expectations. She makes perfect sense during class and even manages to make the dry material fun! You have to miss 10+ classes to affect your grade. The previos reviewer has no idea what they're talking about!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Diana Pehlic	3.5	0	Social Science	213	3	3	2	1578720	6/6/11	I earned a B+ in this class so this is not a vengeful post...I just want to advise you to take the class with someone else. She's not from here and she's confusing with her language at times. She takes things to seriously (after 3 absences, you go a letter grade down and you must sign the sheet everyday, hence me earning a B+ instead of an A-.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	306	5	3	3	1092538	1/2/13	This class was really easy. Dr. Peleg's explanations are spot on and clear to the point where complex math gets boring. Yes, you have to attend class, pay attention, take notes, and do the homework, but if you do that, this class should be an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	5	1092538	10/22/12	A better Differential Equations teacher there never was. Derived the relevant equations in front of us, explaining as he went along. One in-class quiz which he makes jokes about for weeks before. He made things look so easy that studying for the exams was practically optional. Very clear and helpful, has a background in Physics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	443	1	3	4	1092538	12/23/09	Tough class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	4	1092538	12/13/12	Going into MTH306 I heard horror stories but Peleg was actually a really good professor. One quiz that he tells you the topic. Midterm was tough but he grads EXTREMELY fairly. Final was laid out clearly but there were a few curveballs. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MTH306!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	443	1	3	5	1092538	3/23/10	The class is very tough, but you learn the material. Lectures are generally very clear (although sometimes boring) and pretty much necessary if you want to do well in the class. He teaches by working through a lot of examples before explaining the general theory.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Avner Peleg	4.2	2	Mathematics	306	3	4	5	1092538	1/14/08	Dr. Peleg is foreign, however his accent is very understandable. He only has 1 midterm and 1 final exam (worth together a total of 60% of your grade). He says he'll have pop quizzes, however he only gave one, and he announced it. I would highly recommend Dr. Peleg for Differential Equations.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	241	1	5	1	501966	7/31/07	Didn't enjoy his course. Was a good guy but his exams were difficult for no reason. Should have been an easy course but he challenges you and it is worthwhile. Very helpful. I didn't like his course but he's a good guy and he knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	3	501966	12/4/05	Best ever!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	201	4	5	3	501966	5/20/05	Great class, learned a lot. Homeworks from Style are a boring, but it's an easy class. Grades hard ont he first round of papers, but easy on the portfolio.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	101	3	5	3	501966	1/23/05	He's is a good teacher and I will advise anyone to take him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	102	3	5	3	501966	4/10/06	Kevin is the best, he is always willing to help and calls out the morons in the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	102	2	5	2	501966	10/28/05	Kevin really is a great guy. One of the best english teachers ive ever had. I highly recommend him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	201	4	5	4	501966	4/15/05	Pretty easy course, very detailed syllabus, no tests, only 3 papers all of which can be resubmitted, short quizzes after readings, attendence taken most things discussed in class are pretty relavent to everyday life (racism, homosexuals, individuals)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kevin Pelletier	4.9	2	English	101	4	5	4	501966	11/16/04	I thought his class was ok-we read many articles about current events-advertising, the internet, tv, sports, etc. 4 essays about 4 pages each. He is a tough grader but everything can be resubmitted. no tests. quizzes after readings. attendance taken. sometimes class can be boring. a red sox fan
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Pendergast	4.2	2	Science	300	3	4	4	273530	12/23/10	Good professor and definitely knows what he's talking about. However, his questions are so long by the end you don't even know what he was asking--that's where I got tripped up on the tests so make sure you can decipher them! Also look at old tests there was some recycling on my test.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Pendergast	4.2	2	Science	300	3	5	5	273530	8/23/07	Very thorough, goes a little fast and uses an overhead, so he writes the notes along with you, but he makes a lot of misspellings and abbreviates stuff so you have to be a good note-taker to understand your notes. haha He also draws some pretty crazy-looking diagrams. The good side is that he is really helpful and he knows what he's talking about.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	David Pendergast	4.2	2	Science	300	2	5	4	273530	3/31/09	Great professor. He is always willing to help you. He knows what he is talking about. You just need to go to class!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Peraza	2.2	0	History	162	1	2	2	1719046	5/7/12	I am graduating this spring with two degrees in Physics and Math, and I can say that this was the most difficult class I ever took. The professor purposely tries to mislead you, he told us not to study certain topics for the final because he was not going to include them on the final, and then included all of those topics on the final!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Peraza	2.2	0	History	162	1	1	1	1719046	5/7/12	Most difficult gen ed I have ever taken at UB. AVOID if you do not want your GPA to suffer. Required reading every class. Forced to read 3 texts for papers. Gives out review sheets before exams then creates exam with barely any terms from review sheet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Peraza	2.2	0	History	162	1	1	1	1719046	5/7/12	Hard to get A. If you have one grammatical error in a paper, he will immediately remove up to 10 points. Furthermore, he includes numerous difficult exam questions, which everyone gets wrong, which is fine, except you can only get one multiple choice question wrong to receive an A.. Needless to say on the exams not one person got an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Peraza	2.2	2	History	161	4	5	5	1719046	5/5/12	Best TA at UB. Great guy, really helpful and has a keen insight on things. Provides great feedback and genuinely cares about the students
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrea Perez Mukdsi	4.9	2	Languages	101	3	5	3	1536498	7/17/12	Great professor, she kept the class interesting and interactive. ITA101 is pretty easy, but 102 gets intense and covers loads of material. Just make sure you do the homework b/c it really helps. And participate, it's a big factor in grading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrea Perez Mukdsi	4.9	2	Languages	102	3	5	4	1536498	5/10/12	Andrea is a great teacher. She explains everything really well, and she's really funny. I absolutely loved her class. You do have to go to class though, because a large part of the grade is participation.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrea Perez Mukdsi	4.9	2	Languages	350	3	5	5	1536498	4/13/11	Argentine! Great! Understanding! Very helpful! Passionate about what she teaches. Knows hers stuff and beyond all the beyonds! Strongly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrea Perez Mukdsi	4.9	2	Languages	151	3	5	5	1536498	5/19/12	Great class. Professor Mukdsi is enthusiastic and loves to teach. She makes class so much fun. She is also very helpful and wants her students to succeed. She is always full of energy which makes her classes exciting to attend. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrea Perez Mukdsi	4.9	2	Languages	101	2	5	3	1536498	9/27/11	great energy. very sweet lady, wants students to succeed. always will give help. material moves quickly though and languages are hard
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	598260	11/28/12	He is extremely approachable, knows his field well, and understandable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	2	Anthropology	333	2	5	4	598260	12/30/11	He's awesome, his class may be challenging but I think it's worth it. He's very approachable and willing to help you with anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	2	Anthropology		1	5	3	598260	11/4/06	He has been exceedingly helpful and supportive. He knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	2	Anthropology	333	4	5	3	598260	11/8/12	He is a great professor and is extremely approachable. He made the class interesting and relatable, and was available whenever anyone needed him. The information taught is relevant to many other science fields.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	2	Anthropology	600	3	5	5	598260	1/10/07	Provided clear and helpful guidance. Will take him again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Douglas Perrelli	4.2	0	Anthropology	560	2	2	4	598260	4/15/05	class was awful, disorganized, and we didn't learn anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	5	5	494452	2/15/13	He's a strict guy but he wants his students to do well! He is very helpful esp. if you go to class! his exams are hard but he will do everything to help you, he takes a look at over 100 flash cards in about 2 days just so you can do well on your exam! Great guy, Great class! But a challenge!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	5	4	494452	12/6/12	I missed the first day by accident and when I came in the following day he was not going to help me at all. However once I sat in his class, I saw he was a great professor and I could really learn from him, and I did. He cares about his students, present and past, and will help them with whatever they need. But you have to work for it too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	5	4	494452	4/6/12	Really interesting course. He's definitely one of the harder teachers of the class. The other teachers are easier, but if you want a fun interesting class take peters. He's really good and will help anyway possible for you to understand the concepts. Do the readings!!! Study make index cards (hell check them for you). Work hard itll pay off
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	4	5	4	494452	5/12/11	When I first saw Peters I was intimidated. However, he is kind and the most helpful professor I have ever had. If your first test grade is low he will weigh the other ones more because he wants to give credit for improvement throughout the course. There are readings assigned every class and the next class there is a quiz on them. I reccomend him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	5	4	494452	3/27/10	Phenomenal professor!! The secret in his class is to DO THE WORK!! He simply insists it. There are no freebies in his class. He is very old school, and doesn't accept any BS. You feel like you earn every grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	5	3	494452	4/19/08	Attendance mandatory. Class taught in conversational format. He's a really easy going guy. Tests are a bit hard, but he offers review sessions/oppertunities. Gives notes out of his mouth, followed by a brief power point. Interesting topics!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	5	5	494452	10/15/07	Great Profesor! Seems tough at first but if very helpful. Exams are fair but he can go quick in class so i recommend printing out the notes on his website before class. Makes the class time go fast!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	4	5	5	494452	9/25/06	he is a really good teacher a bit intimidating since he looks like a body builder but actually very intelligent and willing to help
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	1	Social Science	210	1	1	3	494452	10/29/05	I can't stand this guy. Pompous, arrogant, and seems to think that life outside of his class doesn't exist.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	4	5	3	494452	1/31/05	He is a really good professor, he knows everyones names. He has accomplished alot and shares his experiences with his students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	210	3	5	5	494452	12/29/12	There is so much I wish I can say about him. He is great! He teaches not only from the books, which is required, but also refers to his experiences as a counselor. He is very demanding but cares a lot for his students. Course work is difficult and pivotal, but as long as you read and attend class, you can receive a good grade!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	4	3	494452	5/10/12	He comes across as being a really difficult professor on the first day of class, which scares off a few people, but he will do whatever he can to help you review for exams. There is a LOT of reading for this class though, so be prepared to read something for every class.He also gives daily quizes on the reading material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	5	5	494452	8/30/11	Amazing teacher, loved his way to teaching he gets you to learn. notes are a must and his study sessions that he holds help a lot. he gives a lot of information and expects you to read. very intimidating at first look but turned out to be a very nice teacher. taking another class of his this semester called ssc 210
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	5	3	494452	4/12/11	Hes tough on you to make you succeed. Genuinely nice guy. Challenging class. Mandatory attendance. Extra A averaged in if you go to every class. Reading is necessary. He holds review sessions and is very helpful. Gives notes fast. Don't take this class unless you can handle it. Very good experience
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	4	5	2	494452	9/1/09	peters seemed very strict and mean at first but inside just a genuine professor who care and wants u to understand and have passion to learn what he loves! although he reminds me of buzz light year from toy story he was a great professor if u go to class and do th e work you will pass
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	2	5	2	494452	1/7/08	Really took a lot from this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	1	5	1	494452	4/29/07	Dr Peters seems very mean at first, but this is just to e=weed out the people that don't want to really work. He is actually extremely helpful. I really don't understand what the readings he handed out had to do with the class though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	1	Social Science	103	1	3	4	494452	4/1/06	arrogant, impossible exams, don't take him if you can avoid him!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	4	1	494452	4/12/05	He's a pretty good professor, very fair and knows everyone's names by the second/third class. he takes attendance every class and if you're in class everyday he bumps almost a letter grade up
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	211	3	5	1	494452	12/1/04	best teacher ever
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	100	3	5	3	494452	11/17/04	Peters is the man!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mark Peters	4.6	2	Social Science	103	3	5	5	494452	11/10/04	I absolutely LOVE this class, he is the greatest professor, so helpful and tries to include everyone in class discussions. He will stay after if you need to go over the lecture or something. Tests are a little difficult so it takes some work. Highly recommend the class and professor, u learn alot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	4	3	4	295191	3/26/13	His accent made it hard to pay attention in lecture. I stopped going to class and taught myself from the book and homework. His quizzes are easier than other 107/108 professors. Tests are fair, much easier than the homework. Understand the homework and you will get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics		5	5	4	295191	12/25/12	He is the best professor I have ever been taught by! I do recommend taking phy108 with him! he gives a lot of examples that come in the test in its same concept and focus on previous exams as well, which makes it easy to study and save time ! GOODLUCK!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	0	Physics	107	2	2	4	295191	5/10/12	very hard to understand, poor professor. not helpful when questions are asked
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	2	5	1	295191	11/9/11	Good teacher, but he gets very angry if you disrupt his class. Difficult to understand with his accent, but slides are good and if you can understand him, he says a lot of good stuff. Tests are usually fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	0	Physics	107	2	1	4	295191	1/16/11	Could never get any more credit on debated questions, regardless if everyone I knew interpretted a question a different way than was intended. Very condescending when asked questions. PPT slides resembled a book. Excessive stutters made me not want to be there. Gave "hints" to incapable students who asked how to do problems during test. Run away.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	5	5	295191	5/7/10	Hard to understand-thick Greek accent and talks fast. Gives good notes that are available online. Very willing to work with students to help them. Will answer all questions. Definitely the best professor for 107. Grading system leaves something to be desired but it's a universal PHY107 system, not specific to him. Class itself is easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	0	Physics	107	4	3	1	295191	5/2/10	Very hard to understand. Usually I can adjust to accents, but I just couldn't here. He talks very fast, and he's essentially a talking textbook. I never went to class b/c of this. Also, the grading is on a relative scale, so the curve can hurt you. And all of the honors kids take this class, so you have to compete with them. I would avoid him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	4	5	3	295191	12/26/09	Great professor. Lecture is boring, but he tries to make it fun with demonstrations. Accent is sometimes hard to deal with, but you get used to it. Had in-class clicker quizzes on random days which meant that you had to attend almost all classes. Very helpful in office hours and VERY helpful during exams. Exams are OK and cheat sheets allowed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	0	Physics	107	3	2	3	295191	5/5/09	Very boring and odd accent. Has good powerpoints though, and allows formua sheets and graphing calculators for exams. Class is fair, but puts you to sleep if you go.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	3	4	4	295191	1/15/09	I never went to class because when I went all I would do is talk or fall asleep. But I studied that book a lot and did well on the tests. But he's nice and loves physics. nice curve
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	4	5	4	295191	1/19/13	Took him for PHY107 and PHY108 and it does take a little while getting used to him. Although he appears intimidating (as a small, Greek man) in class when he occasionally rants, he's actually extremely understandable and friendly. You can tell he's passionate in physics and more than willing to answer questions. He will give you hints during exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	107	4	3	1	295191	5/17/12	This is the honest to god truth. All the physics professors are terrible. The only reason Petrou gets a higher average cuz all the honors students are in his class. Honestly I would just take Zheng because his overall class average is horrible making it easier to pass with a decent grade. Besides this, there really isn't any difference.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	5	5	295191	4/12/12	If you are required to take 107, make sure you get him. He is the best out of the three professors for 107 (his test average is 10+ higher than the others). Has a thick Greek accent. In class quizzes are easy and the online hw is not too bad, just time consuming. Do not interrupt his class and enjoy the moments when other people interrupt his class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	4	5	4	295191	7/29/11	Very helpful, do not be afraid to ask him a question he will always help. He can be intimidating to some but really he is an extremely nice guy. He loves his subject and conveys it when teaching it. TAs grading tests can be extremely harsh though; that is my only complaint.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	5	5	5	295191	11/27/10	I had professor Petrou for both 107 and 108. He is extremely helpful, he will always answer questions no matter where or when!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	0	Physics	107	4	1	4	295191	5/6/10	Very hard to understand his accent. He encourages you to ask questions and then does not have the patience to answer them without getting angry if you do not understand something. Grading was on a relative curve which could hurt you. Overall his teaching style is BOGUS.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	5	4	5	295191	1/11/10	He's pretty hard to understand but knows his stuff. He looks like a little gnome.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	4	4	295191	5/14/09	He is really a pretty solid professor. His accent takes a little getting used to but overall is not that hard to understand. There is a reason his class averaged like 10 points better on every exam - he's the best option you have. Take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	107	3	4	3	295191	3/25/09	I haven't gone to his class since the first week. Homework is online through a website called wiley plus. The lecture slides are online and cover everything you'd need to know. Great teacher if you don't want to have to attend class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	107	2	5	1	295191	4/16/08	I never went to lecture and did good on the tests. He is very very hand to undertsnad and it is very very hard to stay awake in class. Good techer very hard to understand. the class is recommended if u need it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	3	2	4	295191	8/9/07	He is not bad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	3	5	3	295191	10/11/06	A whirling dervish. A Greek, whirling dervish of physics. That is all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	5	5	5	295191	4/20/06	By far the best physics prof. at UB. He is very funny (probably by accident) and knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	3	4	3	295191	8/31/05	Very energetic nice guy. Has a passionate for physics. Not the best teacher, but he always tries to keep youi entertained and engaged.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	4	3	295191	5/9/05	Going to class was definately helpful. He reviewed basic concepts very well and did examples on fridays. He talked a little fast but was not hard to get used to. He also did a few demonstrations in class which were pretty amusing. The exams are a piece of cake, but the hw was rather annoying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	4	4	295191	5/5/05	Very nice guy, seems to know his stuff, funny at times, overall not a bad professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	3	5	3	295191	3/9/05	This is a good teacher, tries to make physics interesting. Tests are not bad if you go over the practice tests that he posts online. You are also allowed to bring one sheet of paper to the exams, so you don't have to memorize the formulas.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	108	3	5		295191	4/13/04	A great guy, really gets into the topic. A lot of fun, if you like Physics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	3	3		295191	11/21/03	He tries to be helpful but he uses his office hours to give us the homeworks rather than answer the specific questions of his students. He is funny at times and creates a good atmosphere. He doesnt do enough example problems however.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	108	2	3	1	295191	11/30/06	I hated this class. I didnt like learning about the material, nor did I understand it. Nobody goes to lecture and the tests were on saturdays. But Petrou does his best to make it interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	5	5	5	295191	6/8/06	Dr. Petrou is one of the nicest teacher you'll met at UB. He is a very cute little man. He is very, extremly nice, patient when you need help. He is a one of the most understanding Prof. He will work thing for students advantage with reasonable explaination. Just put in your best effort; even a person that doesn't like physic can get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	4	4	4	295191	3/11/06	He does have an accent and talks a little fast, but a greek accent is easier to get through than an asian one. His lectures are usually pretty good. He's always talking about how he shouldn't be drinking while he writes up the notes. The test scores are about 10 higher in hs class, but they equalize them, so that might be a bad thing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	3	5	3	295191	5/9/05	One of the better teachers for physics. While he does tend to go a bit fast in lectures, he always tries to help in office hours and even during exams if you have questions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	1	Physics	107	3	3	4	295191	5/8/05	The best available at UB but not the best at teaching. He doesn't explain things that well and he goes very fast. Office hours pretty much answers all the homework questions without great explanation. And kinda makes you feel stupid when you ask a question. An all right teacher, study hard.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Athos Petrou	3.5	2	Physics	107	3	5	4	295191	1/27/05	hahaha, the guy's on speed. He's all over the classroom at once, and he gets all nerdy when it comes to teaching, he loooves physics. it's got it's goods and bads. he's a little fast, and you might lose him, but because he's so enthusiastic, he'll try and make sure you understand.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	M. C. Pederson	5.0	2	Art History	102	4	5	3	1006052	7/4/07	I just started taking Art History for the second time, and she is way better than Prof. Johnson, she's nice and straightforward with you, she tells you what you need to know for the tests and she's giving us a cool presentation and research project. She lectures well, not too fast and not too slow, I recommend her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sol Ines Pelaez	3.2	1	Languages	152	4	3	4	1221396	5/4/09	Meh, she needs to choose quia or written assignments and stick to one, both is too much to do. Average
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sol Ines Pelaez	3.2	2	Languages	151	5	5	4	1221396	12/5/08	Great teacher very enthusiastic, really enjoyed the class. Which wasn't hard at all, would definitely take her again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sol Ines Pelaez	3.2	0	Languages	208	2	1	5	1221396	3/15/09	Teaching methods are difficult to understand, assigns lots of homework, some assignments announced verbally, some assignments sent by email, some assignments just expected to be done because they are on the syllabus, yet sometimes we don't follow the syllabus...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	250	2	3	2	92308	12/18/07	This class was so much harder than I thought it would be. You need to study like crazy for his tests because they don't have that many questions. He wrote the textbook so all of his lectures come from the book. Print off the notes because he writes a novel on each slide. But he knows what he's talking about and class is kind of interesting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	0	Psychology	250	1	2	1	92308	12/6/07	you better study your ass off because the tests are excessively hard. Research methods is very boring - every time i tried to study I wanted to smash my face off the desk. The professor commutes from maryland, so he is hard to get a hold of. not the best at responding to e-mails. overall this class sucked and i'm glad it's over. peace out
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	250	2	4	3	92308	9/5/07	GOod
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	5	4	3	92308	6/20/06	you really have to study for his class, but all u have to do is ONLY follow his study guides completely.. and u'll have to at LEAST get a B. plus, he gives extra credits and his class is damn interesting & informative!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	3	4	3	92308	4/21/06	Class is VERY interesting and he actually makes you understand the material, very dedicated to psychology. Exams are a bit difficult but if you study and read the book they're fine. Awesome professor, wish I could take another class with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	0	Psychology	250	1	1	3	92308	12/12/05	his tests are super hard and he it appears that he does not care about student learning. All he cares about is how well you read the book. Never take this class with him unless you are prepared to memorize 350 pages of his stupid book. By the way the book contains all of his cheesey jokes as if we didn't get enough during class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	0	Psychology	331	1	1	3	92308	11/12/05	He makes class fun, but his exams are way too hard even if you read all the material, I have friends in other classes with him and they say the same exact thing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	250	5	5	5	92308	10/24/05	this guy is a genius and class wasn't actually boring. highly recommended
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology		3	5	5	92308	9/3/05	This man is so dedicated; he commutes every week from Washington D.C. just to come to Buffalo and teach! His classes are never boring, especially when he always has The Simpsons helping him out. He makes the material quite easy to understand. I very muc
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	337	3	4	5	92308	5/4/05	Very interesting and dedicated to the subject, but too nit-picky on his tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	250	2	5	2	92308	12/10/07	You have to go to class, and you have to read the book to do well on the exams. The book and the class were both way more entertaining than I thought they would be. He's a great teacher. The tests are tough, but fair. If you study hard, you'll get a good grade, and learn a lot. Best psych teacher I've ever had at UB, hands down.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	0	Psychology	250	2	1	1	92308	12/3/07	Slides are excessively long and dry. It was very difficult to get myself to go to this class and sit through the whole thing. Professor was not very available for help and exams were difficult. One of my least favorite classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	250	3	3	4	92308	10/31/06	Really read the text book, he wrote it and the test is based on that and the readings. He offers extra credit and you can drop the lowest grade. He likes what he does and it's an interesting class. I did well in the class, but it is a lot of reading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	3	5	4	92308	5/4/06	really cool, people actually wanted to come to class, gave out money in class and showed funny simpson clips.tests are really hard and you MUST MUST MUST read the book.he gives review sheets online and drops the lowest test. take the optional quiz and read the online material, it will help a lot. PRINT THE SYLLIBUS, HE DOESNT REMIND ABOUT TESTS!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	1	2	3	92308	4/10/06	He is a nice professor. He makes the class fun but like all other students said, he's exams are WAY TOO HARD....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	0	Psychology	250	2	2	3	92308	12/4/05	Don't ever take a teacher who writes there own book! :(
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	1	Psychology	250	3	3	1	92308	10/31/05	He is an ok teacher. He tries to make his class more interesting. Inorder to do really well in his course you must know his book and terms back in forth. You need to be able to say them right off the top of your head. Good luck with him. If I was you I would take someone else.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	5	5	5	92308	8/16/05	Prof. Pelham is a great public speaker. This subject is interesting first off, but with him he makes so that you want to go to class..wierd huh?! Just shows you how well he prepares the material. You NEED to read the text and study guides to ace the exams!! Reading the textbook and recommended readings for class are extremely important!! He's good.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	331	4	3	1	92308	4/14/05	this guys knows what he's talking about...his approach to the course material is interesting, too. The only hangup is that a lot of people generally don't read the textbook, so therefor think tests are hard -- NOT if you read the text; this is college
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	224	4	4	2	92308	4/12/05	this man is hilarious. makes class exciting because you are always left wondering what crazy stunt he'll pull every class. never boring and i would take his class again any day.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology	405	5	5	4	92308	1/11/05	One of the best professors. Always willing to help. He made the class material very interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brett Pelham	3.9	2	Psychology		2	4		92308	5/22/03	Makes class as interesting as possible. Tests are on the difficult side, but if you go and do all your work its manageable.

The class consists mostly of videos and audio recordings. If you pay attention and express genuine interest in the class, you'll do well. Two tests; one in-class and one that is open-notes. I loved this class and I learned a lot. Recommended for non-majors
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	3	5	5	541792	9/23/10	Lorna now teaches at Buff State, best teacher ever.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	1	2	2	541792	5/14/08	Nice person, class was somewhat interesting, but gave WAYYY too much work for a 100 level class, don't take her unless you don't want a life for a semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	3	5	4	541792	4/4/08	I took Lorna for ENG102 and I really enjoyed it. The workload might be overwhelming, but it's generally not too difficult, the reading is about 5-10 pages and the major papers are 5-10 pages. 2-page research papers (gotta do 5 out of 9 topics) & very easyy grammar quizzes weekly. Lorna's class discussions are very interesting! Fun&chill teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	101	2	5	2	541792	12/4/07	she is a very good teacher and will def. make your writing skills improve, she is somewhat difficult but if you work hard you will be fine. She is easy to talk to and gives you very good feedback. She is open to any point of view as long as you can defend it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	101	3	4	2	541792	8/28/07	Lorna is nice. She is crystal clear and is openminded. She tells you what you need to do or what not to do. A lot of writing for homework, but maybe thats just college :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	3	5	4	541792	4/1/07	I absolutely adore Lorna. I actually look forward to this class every day. I have been searching and searching for any other classes she might be teaching next year. Definitely get any class with her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	101	3	5	2	541792	4/27/06	Interesting class discussions and assignments. Nice teacher, not too strict.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	3	5	3	541792	4/14/08	Lorna is a very good teacher. Although i am not an English kind of guy the class is extremely interesting. she is very good at relating the class to the real world. The biggest draw back is it is a lot of work. if she wasn't such a good professor i probably would have dropped the class and taken it over the summer.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	0	English	102	1	1	3	541792	12/21/07	do not take this course!!!!! ijnore all other comments!!!! please save your self!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	101	3	4	4	541792	11/16/07	Lorna is a good teacher, yet if you don't understand one of her (vague) assignments, she occasionally makes it more confusing...i wish she would be more to the point. Her class consists of interesting discussions, and she always asks how our lives are, etc. She really is smart...but kind of smart ass & very opinionated. A lot of work too, but fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	0	English	102	1	1	1	541792	8/26/07	i hate to say this....but lorna kinda ruined my life. she gave so much work that i had a nervous break down. and gained 5 pounds. please dont take her course unless you must.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	102	2	5	2	541792	1/8/07	Awesome professor. Loved the class discussions and she was very helpful with editing papers. Insanely smart and goes on amusing rants of random things during class. Easy to talk to and available to email with questions. Easy textbook.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	101	3	5	4	541792	4/23/06	if you get to know her... she is a really good person too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Perez	4.2	2	English	251	3	5	5	541792	4/3/05	Best professor I've had so far!! Class consists of awesome discussions and close readings of the short stories. She quotes the Simpsons and asks how **** we got on our weekend, and she's crazy smart. Take any class she is teaching!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Perkins	2.5	2	American Studies	112	4	4	1	1470268	12/13/10	Prof. Nightigale assigned WAY to much reading and Jessica expected us to do it all, otherwise good class

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Meredith-Joy Petersheim	3.9	2	Political Science	332	3	5	5	1119510	8/18/08	The teacher knowns her stuff even though the material can be dry. She is extremely helpful and grades somewhat on a curve as long as you participate and do your work. In addition, the professor is the hottest female professor at ub, and i would take ANY class that she taught again.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Meredith-Joy Petersheim	3.9	0	Political Science	332	4	1	1	1119510	4/11/08	Essentially, the entire course is based on grades on 4 quizzes, group work, and one HUGE paper that is worth 50% of your grade. She's really nice so if you go in to talk to her about your paper, she will grade more leniently. It's an easy class - take notes (although she talks SUPER FAST) on her powerpoints. You don't learn anything though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	542	3	1	4	163093	10/27/12	Peterson expects a level of respect that she is unwilling to return. Peterson will unprofessionally reprimand and criticize students in public forums. Instructions and expectations are unclear. Peterson will contradict herself, resulting in an adverse affect on grades. No room for anything less than a robotic "Yes M'am!" in her classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	5	1	4	163093	4/28/10	Dr. Peterson is knowledgeable but very condescending and patronizing. Her assignments are way too easy, especially in Reference Services (the other class I took with her wasn't so bad). I respect her as a professional and as a scholar but NOT as a professor. She abhors teaching and she doesn't do a good job of hiding it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	1	1	1	163093	3/17/10	Worst. Professor. EVER.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	522	2	1	2	163093	10/4/08	Lorna is one of the primary reasons the program at UB has been placed on probation by the ALA. She is arrogant, condescending, and disrespectful. Avoid her if at all possible. It's too bad she doesn't have the guts or decency to stand up and take responsibility for the failure of the program at UB.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science		1	1	5	163093	1/11/05	Very uptight and serious. The work is hard and long. Don't take this class on the net. She hates the internet. Never laughs. Never seems happy. Don't think about calling her Lorna. It's Dr. Peterson, even to her friends.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	518	2	4	5	163093	11/14/04	Very high standards and expctations.Volume of work required for this class is higher than any other- yet you do learn a lot. No spoon-feeding .Thorough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	516	2	5		163093	12/18/03	She expects A LOT. It will seem hard when you're doing the reference sets, and her standards are quite high, but you will come out of her class SO PREPARED!!! I hated her class while I was in it, but appreciate her so much now that I'm done!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	516	3	2		163093	9/17/03	She is sooo scatterbrained. It's so boring to sit in her class and watching her try and remember what she is supposed to say next. I think if she likes you than she will be nice, but if you never speak or say something wrong than she won't be very nice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	2	1	2	163093	5/4/10	Should have listened to the warnings about Peterson. I took 518 online. The majority of the class was a waste of time. Felt like I didn't learn anything. Got a C on the final project b/c of ONE mistake. I e-mailed her about it and she refused to even consider my P.O.V.: just quoted the syllabus. Stubborn, condescending & just downright unfriendly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	518	1	5	5	163093	4/28/10	I took Reference and International Bibliography (both online) with Dr. Peterson. She has a very serious and no-nonsense approach to learning, and no she is not there to hold your hand, folks. Expect to work hard,and play by the rules, as reference was the most demanding class-but the knowledge gained was and still is well worth it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	1	1	4	163093	1/4/10	Lorna Peterson personifies the failings of the UB Library Science program. Her arrogant, self-centered approach to teaching is a significant barrier to effective teaching. her disdain for human interaction outweighs her obvious intelligence.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	518	2	5	5	163093	12/20/08	Dr. Peterson is as solid a professor as UB has. I was very amused at the many negative ratings. If you want a friend, get a dog. If you want a professor who is aware of and active in the professional issues of the day -- and you should if you intend to pursue the profession -- she is a top choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	1	2	5	163093	4/14/07	Dr. Peterson is unreasonable, curt, rude. She does know a ton about reference librarianship.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	518	2	5	5	163093	1/14/05	She teaches like a graduate professor should. She does not coddle students, but at the graduate level, she shouldn't. You learn a great deal in her class. Be prepared to work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science		2	1	5	163093	12/7/04	Ugh!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science		3	4	4	163093	11/10/04	She is clear about her expectations, which the average student who is willing to put in a little work will be able to meet. Doesn't deserve the nasty reputation she has - she simply refuses to baby students, which some professors are willing to do.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	523	2	5		163093	11/28/03	Dr. Peterson gives great advice to help students prepare for their first professional librarian positions. If you are lazy and whine, don't take her classes. Lots of work, but she does not cut deeply when grading. She cares/wants students to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science	518	2	4		163093	8/1/03	Typical librarian.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	1	Library Science		2	2		163093	7/31/03	Peterson is a mixed bag. I hear great things about and she knows her subject in and out. If she likes students she is great to them unfortunately she seems to have nothing but contempt for most. Her personality skills need some serious improvement. She
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	2	Library Science		2	4		163093	3/30/03	Peterson is da bomb
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	1	Library Science	518	1	2		163093	7/22/03	Seems to really dislike students. Needs to retire.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lorna Peterson	2.8	0	Library Science	518	1	1		163093	3/10/03	Has major issues.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Courtney Pfahl	4.6	2	English	102	3	5	4	1311628	4/9/12	Miss Pfahl is a great instructor, she's extremely clear on what she requires. She can grade a bit tough, but she's very approachable and helpful in her office hours. If you don't do as well as you had hoped on an assignment, she allows you to revise it for a regrade. Your writing will improve if you take a class wit her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Courtney Pfahl	4.6	2	English	113	3	5	2	1311628	12/19/11	I found her to be extremely helpful, I really appreciated her sending me detailed comments on my essays for revision. She's a tough grader, but she gives you the opportunity to improve. I was uninterested in the material, but if you like theatre and drama classes then I'd highly recommend this class and Pfahl as your instructor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Courtney Pfahl	4.6	2	English	102	3	4	1	1311628	3/28/10	Class seems difficult, but she is a relatively easy grader and is helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Courtney Pfahl	4.6	2	English	259	4	5	1	1311628	4/6/12	A lot of reading for this class, but what else would you expect from an english class? Come to class ready to discuss reading material, take notes, and you'll do well on the final. There are also 2 papers, 1 of them being a research paper that are about 5-8 pages each. Not a tough grader. Very friendly and office hours are always helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Courtney Pfahl	4.6	2	English	201	4	5	4	1311628	7/5/10	She's really nice and very helpful during office hours. I improved a lot in writing essays because of her. You can revise all your essays for a better grade. The workload seemed like a lot in the beginning, but it eventually evens out.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Pflugrad-Jackisch	4.4	2	History	161	3	4	3	547091	12/20/05	She is a very good teacher. Really knows what she is teaching and is willing to help you if you dont understand. Have to really take notes in class though to get everything. That can be tough sometimes but take 161 with her as the teacher if you can
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Pflugrad-Jackisch	4.4	2	History	376	4	5	5	547091	12/9/05	Great professor if you really want to learn!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Pflugrad-Jackisch	4.4	1	History	161	4	3	5	547091	8/30/05	took her for summer his 161 class. I barely had to do anything & just reviewed for the tests and got an A-. it's not hard at all to do well in her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Pflugrad-Jackisch	4.4	2	History	161	4	3	3	547091	6/27/05	Her class is pretty easy so long as you keep up with writing short papers and read the book before an exam. Not too hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ami Pflugrad-Jackisch	4.4	2	History	161	4	4	4	547091	1/3/05	Great professor to take for HIS161. Interesting lectures and readings. She is very nice and her tests are easy if you pay attention in class, and take notes. The best History professor I've had so far.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian  Phillips	4.0	2	Languages	101	3	3	5	1794472	3/21/13	Great, great professor. I took SPA 'cause I wanted to learn a new language. People who don't care won't learn. It's that simple. I'm always interested. His teaching method is clear.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian  Phillips	4.0	2	Languages	102	3	5	3	1794472	1/24/13	Brian explains things in a clear way that really helps you learn the material. He doesn't only speak in Spanish like some of the other teachers so you can actually learn this stuff. He's also really hot & I love starting at him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R J Phillips	4.0	2	Music	105	3	5	3	1033632	3/31/11	Rob is teaching a tough, fast-paced class with a big time requirement between studying, homework, tutorials, labs, and quizes to keep up with, but he makes it as manageable as possible and is an extremely helpful professor. Nice guy, helpful w/ office hours and other times if needed, very clear, and did great with TA's to use labs to review
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R J Phillips	4.0	2	Music	105	3	5	4	1033632	5/6/09	He has been assigned to teach this very demanding class (MUS105 & 106). If it weren't for him, it could've been a lot tougher. I was very delighted and grateful for having him as my teacher. plus he's a great runway walker.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R J Phillips	4.0	0	Music	105	1	1	1	1033632	9/30/07	extremely hard teacher, if you say he is a teacher, I would say he is tricking you. There are no time to breath in this class. becareful....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R J Phillips	4.0	2	Music	105	2	5	4	1033632	11/22/10	Great teacher. Keeps Music Theory interesting and makes things clear. The class is demanding, but the requirements are fair and Phillips is always willing to help you along the way.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	R J Phillips	4.0	2	Music	105	3	5	5	1033632	1/20/09	This teacher is always there to help, as long as you do what you need to do to follow along with the material. If you can't keep up in a theory class that assumes you know some things already, then you can always take MUS 116. Utilize his office hours!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Maria Picone	4.8	2	Social Work	520	3	5	4	1335483	10/26/12	She is a MUST for interventions! Super friendly and you learn so much taking her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Maria Picone	4.8	2	Social Work	520	2	5	5	1335483	8/19/10	The BEST for Interventions!! Maria is so full of knowledge and experience from the field and she always has the most helpful hints,tips, handouts, stories, etc. HIGHLY RECOMMEND her for clinical courses - she is superb!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Pieknik	3.5	1	English	101	3	2	4	1395078	4/4/10	he is a nice guy, but he's choice or reading is very dull and boring. i don't mind English class but his material was boring to the point where i couldn't read. class attendance is mandatory. essay assignments were very vague and he tried to be of help but just confuses even more.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Pieknik	3.5	2	English	101	3	5	4	1395078	1/13/10	Matt (as he requests you call him) is a pretty cool guy. He creates a good classroom atmosphere and encourages interaction. He is a little bit of a tough grader, but gives you the oppurtunity to revise as much as you want. Only demands a $10 packet of readings for class. Very approachable and helpful. I would recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johnna Pike	4.0	2	Sociology	373	2	3	3	1235946	12/21/10	Prof. Pike is an extremely nice teacher. She is very thorough and very clear. This class has a HUGE reading load between the text book and hte outside articles. Text book was slightly useless as it was all covered in lecture notes. There was a lot of material covered in this class. She did however make the final into a take home exam!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Johnna Pike	4.0	2	Sociology	373	3	4	4	1235946	12/27/08	Pike is a nice professor and lenient when it came to projects that were due. She was very thorough in correcting papers. Always willing to answer any questions. The last exam had too much information covered. Try your best to keep up with the readings and attend class regularly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	1	1	3	755109	4/2/06	I also got a 4 on the Ap Calc exam before i took this class and figured I was in for review. He made calculus more confusing and made me question what I thought i knew. His tests were extremely difficult and often contained problems he didn't really go over/finish. As it's been said: skips over stuff and doesn't finish problems assuming you know.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	2	1	1	755109	12/15/05	One of the worst teachers I've ever had. My understanding of calculus actually dropped because of this course. He goes from step A to step Z without showing any steps in between and assumes an extremely thorough level of background knowledge. Also, his tests are extremely hard compared to other professors' tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	3	755109	12/1/05	Tough teacher at first. He will answer questions if you don't understand things, but only if you ask him to. If you can't do algebra don't take this class. Homework is not collected or graded but his tests come directly from it, so use the hmwk to study from. Tests aren't hard if you look at the hmwk and stay awake in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	2	2	2	755109	11/17/05	I agree. He is very unorganized in his lectures and not too helpful. He jumps from one idea to the next and isn't too clear in his lectures so it's difficult to understand the material. Often times, he does not finish the problems he is working on in class. I'm usually pretty good at mathematics but I'm struggling in his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	2	2	4	755109	3/30/06	I got a 4 on the Ap Calc exam before i took this class. I figured that i would know all the material and i would get an easy A, but no. He actually made calculus more confusing for me and his tests were extremely difficult, he also skips lots of steps when he does his notes and assumes that people know what is going on.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	2	Mathematics	141	4	5	2	755109	12/2/05	nice guy, always answers questions if you ask. test questions come from the homework and review sessions
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	1	2	3	755109	11/19/05	Unclear and unorganized makes calc seem like magic when he randomly skips stes assuming we know what he's doing. I know people who took calc already and he confuses them
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E. Bruce Pitman	1.9	0	Mathematics	141	2	1	2	755109	11/13/05	Horrible teacher. probably the worst that i ever had. Very hard to understand and never slowed down to help students. Very unorganized and doesn't even finish problems when he does examples in class. I strongly recommend not taking his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jose Plehn-Dujowich	5.0	2	Economics	505	4	5	4	806939	11/30/07	He is a great prof...knows his stuff well,he is best when he teaches EMH,Markowitz Models and CAPM..i havent seen any one teaching these topics in such an inetresting way, he clarifies all your doubt....he gives good grades, but remember to review his past exams....they are extremly helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jose Plehn-Dujowich	5.0	2	Economics	505	3	5	5	806939	3/31/06	Great guy! knows his stuff and is helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	2	Anthropology	276	4	5	4	609872	8/26/12	Absolutely amazing class!! I would recommend this class to anyone. So far it has been my favorite class that I have taken at UB. Pollock is an amazing professor. He truly cares about his students. His lectures are very interesting. There are a lot of readings, but they're very enjoyable. The tests are EASY!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	2	Anthropology	476	5	5	1	609872	3/29/12	Awesome professor, attendance isn't mandatory and grade consists of 3 papers. Great guy, very helpful, there isn't a question that he can't answer. Definitely a must take for science majors
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	0	Anthropology	655	3	2	4	609872	1/9/08	Arrogant and manipulative. You won't know how you are doing in the class till the very end as he doesn't grade your work during the semester. He puts down students in class and makes fun of them.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	2	Anthropology	276	5	5	3	609872	5/1/05	Dr. Pollock is one of the greatest professors at UB and he seems to know EVERYTHING. You will actually want to go to lecture because he teaches you to view medicine in a very different way and he always provides interesting examples. Would highly recommend taking a course with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	1	Anthropology	276	3	3	5	609872	4/29/12	Basically tells stories about field work in brazil. Exams are completely open notes and you don't even have to go to class for exam can email it. I went to every lecture but you can still pass without ever going.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	0	Anthropology	276	3	1	4	609872	5/10/08	Outdated. Needs to retire.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	2	Anthropology	655	2	5	4	609872	12/13/07	Dr. Pollock is an awesome professor, who is able to make the abstract ideas of Marx, Durkheim and Weber intelligible! His anecdotal examples provide practical insights into social theory. Dr. Pollock has a wonderful sense of humor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Pollock	3.4	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	609872	11/14/07	Engaging, fun, and very knowledgable

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	0	Philosophy	322	3	1	2	390204	8/23/11	Worst class I have ever taken. Book was not ordered leaving me a week behind the class. Quizzes are ridiculous and not aimed at valuable points of interest. Professor was no clear on what he wanted in his papers. Didn't return papers on time leaving me with little feedback. I would NEVER take a class with this professor again!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	2	Philosophy	108	4	5	5	390204	12/15/04	I had a lot of fun, was a challenging course but not so much that it was intense. A course which you need more then a semester to truly enjoy.Warning: Take this course only if your into talking about acid induced like subjects. Over all he loves what he does and thats what matters.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	2	Philosophy	101	2	4		390204	4/23/04	good teacher but quizzes are VERY detailed and hard
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	2	Philosophy	107	5	4	4	390204	6/6/05	Very nice and lenient prof, sometimes too much so. Very relaxed atmosphere during class. Quizzes are straight forward, and sometimes duplicate from the text. There is nothing hard about this course/prof. Coming from a science background, if you find this hard, you shouldn't be in University.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	0	Philosophy	101	2	2	4	390204	10/31/04	HORRIBLE. he is boring and his quizzes and exams require you to remember every single little detail mentioned. also - was only in office hrs half the times i went!!! not friendly, boring class. i thought it'd be great. individual papers were fun to do but you have to present it in front of the class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gerol Petruzella	3.3	2	Philosophy	108	4	5		390204	4/20/04	you never have to read a page, as long as you attend lecture- you'll get an A he makes the class very interesting. if you're interested in metaphysics and epistomology, he'll blow your mind he's a big star trek fan, too
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Blaine Pfeifer	3.7	2	Engineering	212	2	3	4	1640272	12/18/12	Terrible class and teacher. He is a nice but he doesnt teach very well. He was lazy not to make his own tests. He used homework questions from the book and you just had to use the solutions manual to copy them down. The integrity of the class was awful, students just needed to know which question to look for on the tests to do well. Good luck!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Blaine Pfeifer	3.7	1	Engineering	212	3	3	4	1640272	8/9/12	Cared more about his research and telling you about it than the material for class. Long homeworks. He gives practice exams but the tests were still hard but the curve is pretty good. He's not great though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Blaine Pfeifer	3.7	2	Engineering	212	1	4	3	1640272	10/22/12	A very hard class. Homeworks are long and they are due every week. Tests are open notes but it doesn't really help. If you get a flow diagram wrong, you get the whole question wrong. He is a pretty good teacher, but the class is tough. Good luck.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	447	1	5	5	964381	12/6/11	He's def a very enthusiastic professor who shows great interest in the material he's teaching. Need to go to lecture and take good notes if you want to do well. He's a bit tough, but very fair. Also, very handsome guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	3	5	1	964381	6/7/10	Dr. Pfordresher is awesome. I think he recognizes the fact that most Psych majors find this required class burdensome so he makes it as painless as possible. Great teacher, makes everything easy to understand, if you have to take psych stats make sure to get him! Don't buy the textbook, never used it. Don't go to recitation, waste of time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	4	5	5	964381	4/26/10	I don't like stats but I loved his class! I never dreaded going to class. He made me laugh everyday. I reccomend him!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	3	5	3	964381	6/20/09	He is the best professor I've come across in my 5 years at UB. Easily the best stats class. I am terrible at math, but go to class and do the work and you will get an A. I wish UB had more profs like P.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	4	5	2	964381	3/30/08	PSY 207 may be one of the hardest PSY classes, but Pfordresher makes it so easy to understand. He makes the material EXTREMELY clear. You must attend class to benefit from this though. I only used the book for review and practice problems. I really recommend taking this professor for this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	4	5	2	964381	1/9/08	Great professor! He explains things really well and uses subtle humor to keep you interested. The exams and quizzes are based off the lecture and he gives you all the formulas needed. The best way to get an A in his class is to just pay attention and take notes. I highly recommend this teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	2	5	3	964381	12/3/07	my favorite class. dr. pfordresher makes it very clear and interesting. attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. I didn't read the book, I just used the book for practice problems. Exams are based off of the lecture (and he gives you print-out slides), all quizzes are open book. for psych. stats take pfordresher!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	457	3	5	4	964381	11/14/10	i dont know why pete is teaching at UB and not at Cornell or Harvard. He's too good for this place. I dunno how we got him but somehow we did, take advantage of it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	250	5	5	5	964381	6/7/10	Oh Peter, what a guy. Best stats prof ever. He is interesting and explains things well. You do not need your textbook. Also, recitation is just for extra review. He is so cute and basically amazing. He will call you out in the 500 person lecture for talking/reading the newspaper though!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	3	5	5	964381	2/18/10	his lectures are well prepared. and his voice is eloquent and especially endearing, unlike so many of the other proff where you just can't sit long enough. i wouldn't mind attending all of his lectures if it his werent my only morning class. he's an all star.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	5	5	3	964381	5/12/09	My favorite professor!I was scared 2 take it bc I suck @ math. But it's really the conceptual stuff that's harder than calculating. GO TO LECTURE,he explains things extremely well. Txtbk is just for xtra practice, tests based on notes.Quizzes are open book, but kno stuff b4hand. Cumulative final. Nice guy, friendly sense of humor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	3	4	4	964381	3/4/08	Pfordresher is very good. He has a subtle sense of humor which he uses in his lectures. The slides are online after class, but go to each class, esp. for 3rd exam stuff; he explains it so much better than the book. Just use the book for practice problems, and most of his test questions are better. MC and written answer tests. Get him for PSY 207!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	4	4	3	964381	12/29/07	Pfordresher is very well spoken; he explains things clearly and in a way that you will understand. Material is not hard and the book is not necessary. You should however go to class everyday and pay attention! It is the key to getting an A. Professor is also very funny in a subtle way.. if you pay attention in class you'll know what I mean.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Peter Pfordresher	4.9	2	Psychology	207	4	5	4	964381	3/9/07	Nice guy and good professor, makes material easy to understand. but the way he stops class when someone is mumbling or talking or doing anything made me feel like I was in high school.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Margaret Phillips	3.3	2	Law	516	1	5	5	595932	7/20/07	Wonderful teacher for writing. She is very tough.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Margaret Phillips	3.3	2	Law		2	5	4	595932	4/12/05	One of the few R&W profs that will actually teach you anything. She isn't easy, but will make you a better writer whether you like it or not. She is polarizing- some people really don't like her, others really do.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Margaret Phillips	3.3	0	Law	1	3	1	4	595932	10/25/06	I guess the previous poster is right. I find her comments completely unhelpful-even when you bring VERY specific questions to her. In addition, she doesn't treat her students like adults but rather like young undergraduates. I know 1L's won't have a choice, but you should know what you're getting into.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Phillips	5.0	2	History	111	4	5	3	1531646	8/30/11	Loved her! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Valerie Phillips	5.0	2	History	111	5	5	3	1531646	1/18/11	Had her as a TA for Don McGuire's World Civ 1. Very good TA. Very lenient grader too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	4	26336	12/31/12	Take this course if she is available you won't regret it, like do her assigned hws for the quizzes and exams. The questions for quizzes or exams are really similar to hw assgined problems so I would do those right on time not drag until the exam weeks or finals. Just take her if u can yup
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	411	2	4	3	26336	5/17/12	This is a hard course regardless of which professor teaching, but she does a wonderful job with notes. The tests are practically based off of the homework so passing shouldn't be a problem if you actually try. The teacher's a really nice lady and speaks comprehensible English which is always nice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	3	4	5	26336	10/18/11	Great professor. Really cares about students. Puts notes up online for class and goes through them in class. Maybe a bit boring, but useful. She is a nice lady and will help you if you need it. I would strongly recommend her to anyone taking this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	0	Mathematics	306	2	1	5	26336	4/6/11	Very fast paced class. Just reads off PDF notes each lecture. Gives about one quiz per week. 3 Exams, no final. Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	1	Mathematics	306	2	2	3	26336	4/27/10	Read all of the others comments and can see all sides. I side more with the "not clear enough on important things"- "glosses over things"- "thinks we automatically understand". I approached for help and it seemed less than readily available- (compared to other teachers). Nice lady. Just not for me.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	5	26336	4/24/09	I am not sure where people get that she does'nt curve. The exams were curved to my knowledge. 50 was a D. That looks like a curve to me. She is fair. And yes I agree with homeworks taking 2 hours plus to do but they prepare you well for her exams. Do the homework and you will be fine for exams. There are Maple labs. But they are NOT hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	1	Mathematics	306	3	3	1	26336	2/23/09	If you like someone who throws ridiculous amounts of useless busy work at you and who doesn't curve a friggin differential equations class, then this is the teacher for you. Seriously her homework takes probably 2 hours a night. Assuming you're a math or engineering major, you probably don't have 14 hours a week to devote to one class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	309	4	5	5	26336	4/18/06	Dr. Piech is a great teacher and understands the material very well. Willing to answer any questions about the material in office hours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	1	Mathematics	241	2	3	5	26336	3/23/05	If you want to try to get something out of this class, make sure you bring your hearing aid. She speaks so softly (at times drops to a whisper) that you can only catch less than half of what she says. Also, she goes through things so quickly that not all topics are explained well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	411	3	5		26336	6/1/04	Excellent teacher, very clear and detailed during lectures, textbook is mediocre. The best choice for CS students needing a stats class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	5	26336	12/2/12	You will love her class seriously take her diffiq. It's best prof. at UB I would take her if she is available.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	4	26336	5/6/12	Amazing professor. Her notes for the most part are very clear and she posts them online. Her lectures are a little boring. Hw is assigned at the beginning of the week and if you do the hw after she teachs the section its easy. Plenty of quizzes and tests are not difficult. She really cares about students. Would gladly take her again!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	411	5	5	5	26336	5/13/11	Amazing professor for probability. She has an amazing laugh and an awesome personality. She tells you exactly what she wants you to know!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	5	4	5	26336	5/26/10	Don't listen to the negative comments. If you show up to class and actually have an interest in learning something useful, this will be a very easy class for you. She is a very adept professor and lectures are interesting. Review sheets are given before exams and if you study the sheet, it is nearly impossible to not get an A. Great class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	1	26336	11/12/09	Probably best prof i had from the math department. Some are wayy out there. Homework is assigned every week but she collects like 3-4 weeks worth at once. If you wait to the a day or two before to start any of it its really tough. Tests aren't too bad though. Just do the homework as its assigned and you'll do fine. She's pretty helpful too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	241	4	5	5	26336	3/16/09	Phenomenal professor. Good pace, easy to understand, translates what's in the book into english. Extremely helpful. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	411	3	5	4	26336	4/29/07	Excellent math instructor; very organized, has interesting lectures and moving on with the right pace. Exams reflect the assignments and are graded fairly. The professor sometimes talks too quietly, so need to sit close to the chalkboard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	241	3	5	4	26336	8/30/05	Professor piech is an amazing teacher! she writes goo notes on the board, is easy to follow with visual aids in class. Make sure to do the homework and go to class and you will do well! She is very nice and willing to help you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	301	2	4	3	26336	3/22/05	Good teacher, but thinks you'll simply understand things when you don't. Glosses over important things. A lot of homework, but in this course, it's expected. Tough class, but better teacher than most in this subject.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	241	4	5		26336	4/17/04	Wonderful teacher. Her clarity and helpfulness must be one of the best in UB. The exams are pretty straightforward, no tricky-question. All you need to do is just going to class and doing homework.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	241	5	5		26336	3/10/04	Makes the course a breeze, awesome professor. Highly recommend....just don't take my spot if she teaches another course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	141	4	5		26336	6/18/03	Best professor I've had at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	142	4	4		26336	4/3/03	If you don't do well with this professor... change your major to something that doesn't involve math courses.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	141	5	5		26336	2/2/03	oooooh baby....supposedly a very good prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	2	Mathematics	142	4	5		26336	10/7/03	Best math professor I've had at UB. Explains everything and tests aren't full of surprizes. Just do the homework and go to class, you'll get an A... just the way it should be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Piech	4.4	1	Mathematics		4	3		26336	4/17/03	she writes everything she says. gets annoying, but its easy to get an A

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pientka	4.9	2	Physics	107	4	5	4	1252619	8/30/09	Taught an interesting class and enjoys teaching. Always made concepts clear and gave ample help with homework and test preparation. Highly recommended as a professor for physics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pientka	4.9	2	Physics	107	4	5	2	1252619	7/17/09	Pientka is the man. Extremely entertaining. He really loves physics and finds it fascinating, amazing, and pretty cool. Also, he likes doing experiments in which he predicts the future, but usually forgets to bring all the necessary materials. He made physics interesting and comprehendable. Great teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pientka	4.9	2	Physics	107	4	5	2	1252619	6/23/09	Great guy. He is extremely helpful. He really cares about physics. He knows what he is talking about and he can actually teach it to you so you can understand. And I hope Jim Parry is happy that someone posted something about Pientka. lol. I added the chili pepper just for you Jim Parry. lol. I hope you read this. lol.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pientka	4.9	2	Physics	107	4	5	3	1252619	8/16/09	He is awesome. Puts physics in an easy language to understand. Very helpful. Goes over homework problems step by step before they are due. I would highly recommend him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Pientka	4.9	2	Physics	107	4	5	2	1252619	7/15/09	Pientka is the man. Extremely entertaining.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	111	5	4	4	277838	1/2/08	Difficult to understand at first but after a while he grows on you. He definitely loves World Civ.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	111	5	4	1	277838	11/13/07	He's is super easy read the fisrt chapter of the readings and attend lecture. easy quizes. Everything's right out of the readings.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	102	5	5	2	277838	9/26/07	Great World Civ teacher, very interested in the subject and engaging. In terms of writing, the class is painfully easy and painfully boring. Teaches straight out of the book. I recommend him for world civ, but not for writing, unless you're bad with grammar and conventions and stuff like that. Very nice guy, though and very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	101	2	5	2	277838	4/5/07	Great guy! Really helpful and nice, and smart! He liked to teach and I learned a lot from him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	0	English	101	5	2	3	277838	11/16/06	Very easy teacher! No tests...about 4 papers averaging about 5 pages each. Very easy grader...almost all of my class receives high A's on their papers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	102	4	5	3	277838	12/9/07	Chill guy. Easy class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	102	5	5	5	277838	10/30/07	Very easy and very kind. Everything is straight from the book. I recommend actually reading is though...otherwise you will sit there for up to 5 minutes until he just tells you teh answer. Overall, I would say take his class if you are looking for an easy english credit or are horrible at it.I haven't had him for Civs, but i hear good things.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	101	5	5	5	277838	5/26/07	Great professor. Takes attendance every class, but you can miss three. If you show up, put a little effort forth and do your best on the 5 pages, you'll get an A. Essays are based on the text. No test. Final portfolio of 5 papers written in semester plus revisions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	2	English	101	5	4	3	277838	12/18/06	he's a good teacher. a very nice one. very easy-going. but he can be dull at times .. or most of the time .. u can definitely get an A if u come for attendance nd do ur best on ur essays
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rares Piloiu	3.7	0	English	201	3	2		277838	11/6/03	If you have the chance don't take this english class with him. He is not helpful and his assignments are to unclear so you basically have to guess your way through the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	2	Mathematics	131	5	4	4	1776204	4/11/13	great professor! you can learn a lot if you listen carefully in the class, Exams are easy if you analyze the review he gives to you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	2	Mathematics	131	4	4	5	1776204	3/8/13	good proffesor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	2	Mathematics	131	3	4	2	1776204	12/16/12	very boring class. hard to stay awake. Homework is given every day. Never takes attendance although he probably knows whos in class and whos not. Overall a fair professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	1	Mathematics	141	5	3	3	1776204	4/8/13	He is a nice teacher and an ok teacher. His test are extremely easy. They are exactly the same as the reveiw he gives you. also his examples in class are very similar to the ones seen int he hw.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	2	Mathematics	141	3	5	4	1776204	3/6/13	Great guy, knowledgable and has a sense of humor. My only gripe is his writing is small and not very legible which is problematic since we're in a huge circular classroom. Basically, if you are not early, you're in the back and then...good luck! lol
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Corey  Placito	4.1	2	Mathematics	131	5	5	5	1776204	12/5/12	Really great professor. He really wanted to help you out and his great sense of humor made class fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Pogrebnyak	4.0	2	Engineering	324	5	4	3	1033169	5/4/10	Before I started the course, I was told that this is the hardest class in EE, but heck he makes it ultra easy. His home works are limited to plugging some values in to an equation. His exams are easy and he lets you ask questions during exams. If you have an A- and perfect attendance, Take the class with him if you want a good grade!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Pogrebnyak	4.0	2	Engineering	324	3	4	2	1033169	9/28/07	His lectures can get pretty dry but he is a nice enough guy and he tries to teach as best he can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victor Pogrebnyak	4.0	2	Engineering	574	5	5	5	1033169	4/26/08	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poolin	3.0	1	Psychology	101	2	2	4	1342853	4/10/11	He is good at lecture and it interesting. He explains well and help you to understand the concept. The notes are really important and you need attend class to get them. No essays if you do the experiments which are very easy. Extra credits offered but you have to work on that. Exams are really hard and I do not think textbooks can really help .
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Raechele  Pope	5.0	2	Education	513	4	5	5	1788301	12/31/12	Awesome class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	1	4	4	913398	11/8/11	Class is really fun and interesting. He offers a lot of extra credit opportunities. Just be warned, he is very tough when grading essays. He gives students the chance to rewrite the essays for a better grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	1	4	3	913398	4/29/08	alex makes an extreme amount of comments on papers, mainly alot of negatives and its hard to do everything right for him, little homework, he wants your paper to be perfect, hard to get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	4	5	5	913398	1/6/08	He's a really chill teacher. Keeps track of attendance and there are quite a few readings but the class is focused of SPORTS which I found to be great. He is a fair grader and an overall nice guy!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	2	4	4	913398	7/2/07	Porco Porco he so fine, he so fine he blows my mind, hey porco!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	101	5	5	3	913398	11/8/06	Barely assigned readings from books, little homework, very funny! Gets angry sometimes and is a little scary. Grades accurately (a little hard, but accurately) fun class, fun teacher!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	5	5	3	913398	11/29/08	great teacher. few essays and he puts so many negative comments because he actually wants you to learn and build on your writing skills. he cres about he students and the class is not that hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	201	4	5	2	913398	1/17/08	great guy! take him if at all possible!!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alessandro Porco	4.2	2	English	101	4	4	2	913398	2/1/07	ALex is the man. He is a laidback guy who doesnt give a lot of readings or assignments, other than a few papers here and there. He is a fair grader and a very chill guy. He does get angry when you make the same mistakes on papers, as any teacher probably does. overall, hes the man
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	428	3	5	3	505797	3/25/10	Amazing Teacher! Always willing to help and makes it very clear what she expects of you. Very knowledgable in all aspects of health and a great resource.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	3	3	3	505797	5/8/06	She is a good teacher. She has many examples from her own experience as a nutritionist. Her lectures are clear, and the notes are all in the course manual. The notes are very dense and they seem overwhelming, but if you attend the lectures she tells you exactly what you need to know for the test. Don't bother buying the book, i didnt even open it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	5	3	5	505797	9/26/05	She's helpful, but she knows nothing of diabetes, as a diabetic I was offended by how little she knew, and she's an RN and nutritionist
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	5	5	2	505797	7/20/05	Incredibly easy. Exams test basic concepts and obvious information. It is possible to get above 100% in this class without great effort.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	5	4	5	505797	4/29/05	she is ok. her tests are easy and clear.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	2	5	3	505797	6/20/06	easy class.tests straight fwd and she curves them. few random questions on tests but class still easy to get an A in. everything from lecture book reading not needed. pay close attention to her when she reviews its like 90 percent of the test. tests are predictable. she is interesting to listen to. i heard shes the easiest ntr teacher. 2 thumbs up
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	5	5	5	505797	4/17/06	easy class, good teacher, she tells you exactly what is on the test go to lectures and youll do fine. her reviews are good only if you have quetsions .. if not then dont bother going.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	4	5	3	505797	7/20/05	very nice, answers any questions you have. pretty nice curve, easy to get a b/b+ without doign much at all. highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	108	5	5	5	505797	5/26/05	Came into the class with a strong nutrition background, but I still learned a bit. She really knows her material. Pulled exam material straight from the notes (which were hardcopied by her and three others in the department), textbook wasn't needed at all. Grading curve is set a little high to get an A, but it's not impossible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Candi Possinger	4.6	2	Health Science	109	4	4	3	505797	11/19/04	As long as you go to class you can do well. Exams are taken directly from lass notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	4	1170225	4/10/13	Great professor, the tests are very frustrating because she tries to trick you but you are pretty much guaranteed to learn. I didn't use the textbook, just listened to the lecture slides online and took notes. The lab in general, especially the quizzes are a little ridiculous, however if you spend maybe 30mins studying beforehand you will do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	4	1170225	12/23/12	Most dedicated professor I've had yet. Lectures are clear and recorded so you can pause to take notes as its quite fast paced at times. Know the material in the lecture guide, don't bother with the book. There are practice exams and questions in the book, do them. very similar to actual exam. Exams are not hard, and you can use a note sheet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	3	2	1170225	10/30/12	extremely hard professor. dont take her if you dont have to. take some other professor. she made me hate biology!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	8/28/12	i would recommend this professor her class is easy if u look over the lecture slides and study using her audio recordings. she lets you use cheat sheets for her exams(around 30 questions MC).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	201	5	5	5	1170225	6/7/12	Everyone should take a class with her, makes the subject a lot more interesting than it really is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	4/2/12	Dr. Poulin is a fantastic teacher!I highly recommend her. She is so organized and truly loves teaching. Even though evo bio is a challenging course she makes it interesting. She published a lecture guide that goes along with the course. Its very helpful and has all the info outlined out along with practice questions.Go to office hours and work hard
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1170225	1/7/12	Evo Bio is really hard, but if you get Poulin you are very lucky. She is so nice and so helpful. Just pay attention, take good notes and do really good in lab and you'll be able to get a good grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	4	3	1170225	12/21/11	One of the better professor at UB. I would definitely recommend her. Her exams are tough but manageable
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	12/14/11	Dr. Poulin is my favorite professor so far in UB. Her classes are highly organized and she explained everything crystal clear. Didn't buy the textbook but did buy the lecture guide. Never memorize her material, you have to really understand the concept and everything. Exam questions are tricky but if you pay enough attention, you are fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	1	1170225	12/8/11	Dr. Poulin is the best teacher i have ever had. She is a true nerd at heart but she is the most genuinely nice person i have ever met. She really goes out of her way if you have a problem or are struggling. Her office hours are awesome, she really knows her stuff. She prepares you for lab a lot. And buy the lecture book it is my life savior! :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	3	1170225	1/2/13	hard test with tricky questions..be sureto put in effort and time when making your cheat sheet... relisten to her lectures to do well... for me it really messed up my grade cause I'm not so passionate about Bio whatsoever.great professor but be sure u think twice since most of her test averages are around 50s to low 70s. no textbook!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	11/15/12	This is a do-able class. It requires a lot of work though so don't complain if you get a bad grade yet don't do the work. Buy the lecture guide, and LISTEN to the audio recordings online and write everything down from there. Most of her test answers are the precise details of things she spends little time on in lecture, so use the recordings.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	9/10/12	She is briliant, teaches pretty well, and will not hesitate to help you if you go to her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	0	Biology	200	1	2	1	1170225	6/20/12	Everything that is barely described in lecture will be on your exams. She's extremely tricky, and the exams are VERY hard. You will be fooled on multiple questions. Studying takes at least 12 hours minimum. Extremely hard class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	3	1170225	4/3/12	Dr. Poulin is the best teacher ever! If you have an option take her! Be sure to keep up with the class and go to office hours and the A is yours! Also i would definitely suggest getting the lecture guide, it is a great tool to help you outline the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	2/9/12	BEST TEACHER AT UB. She puts hours into her lectures to make sure you understand, and it very funny! Get the lecture guide!! And go to office hours, she gives out test hints there! Lots of material, but Poulin makes sure you can get it all!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	201	1	4	2	1170225	12/21/11	This class is really hard, but it's entirely possible to get a high grade in this class. Know the lecture material from each lecture and consistently review it and use lab to bring up your grade. Your grade depends on how you are in relation to the class average. Hope for a dumb class. The curve for fall '11 was <10 points.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	0	Biology	200	5	1	1	1170225	12/19/11	Easiest Bio 200 prof by far. Herreid's class is MUCH more difficult yet he is a much better professor as well- been around forever and clearly loves what he does. If your an honors student like me and love a challenging class AND a good professor, and are not just looking for the easy class, take HERREID. much better prep for the MCAT than Poulin
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	12/12/11	Poulin's class is very interesting. Informative lecture so pay attention and take great notes. She provides slides and audio links online which are very helpful. Evolutionary bio is a difficult course in general so you need to study for that course. Also, do not buy the textbook! Buy her lecture guide and lab manual. I suggest you take her class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	4	1170225	11/8/11	Favorite professor at UB so far. Doesn't put me to sleep or anything. Her lectures are very planned out and you can tell she loves Evolutionary Biology. Definitely buy a lecture guide. Ive never gone to her office hours or anything but from her review days I can tell she's really helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	101	3	4	3	1170225	10/1/11	Dr. Poulin was so interactive with her students. She really makes everything clear. All I will say is don't bother buying the textbook... I never touched mine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	4	1170225	8/8/11	Don't buy the book, it is completely useless. The lecture guide is absolutely the best creation ever. Buy it, use it, sleep with it next to your pillow. It is the key to getting an A. Her lectures are incredible! One of my favorite professors of all time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	3	1170225	5/1/11	Great Professor!! She tells you everything you need to know for the test in the lecture. She gives you a study guide for each lecture and holds helpful office hours. She's very helpful and approachable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	5	1170225	4/1/11	Amazing Professor!!! There is a lot of material and you have to work hard in order to achieve an A, but its definitely obtainable. I ended up getting an A because i went over and listened to her audio/video recordings! Probably one of the best professors you will find at UB! You are going to miss her when this class is over!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	12/23/10	Dr. Poulin is great. She gives you everything that you need to get a good grade, its just up to you how much effort to put in. Her tests are hard and questions are usually long situation as opposed to straight forward facts. I got a 76, 48, 67 on all the exams (84 Lab Final) and got an even B in the course. No required textbook. Loads of fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	3	1170225	12/17/10	Dr. Poulin is a great professor, tests are hard but lab counters that. I did barely any studying and got a B-. Don't buy the book, it's expensive and tests are based on lectures. Take Poulin's class if you have the chance!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1170225	12/8/10	Fun teacher, great teacher in fact. Slides are easy to follow but most info comes from her. Tests are very hard. Hard to fail the class, but also hard to exceed. 4 ests, 1 and 2 are on specific parts of the lecture, 3rd is cumulative on lecture, 4 is lab final. Cheat sheets for them all, but even with that you'll find these tests rough
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	10/28/10	I will never skip Dr. Poulins lectures, even though attendance isn't mandatory. She's hilarious and she knows how to present the material so that it's interesting. She reviews everyother week which is very helpful. I would highly recommend taking her course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1170225	10/6/10	Easily the best teacher I've ever had at UB. Down to earth, funny and keeps things interesting. Tests can be tricky, but she provides more than enough resources to succeed in this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	3	3	1170225	8/1/10	She is awesome teacher.It's my second time taking it n I learn a lot compare from Herreid class.She explain very clearly and if u pay attention, everything is on the test.Even though, tests r long questions, but they make sense.I'm not a Bio student at all especially Evo,but Dr. Poulin is better than the others. Take her if you can!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	8/30/11	Probably one of the best professors I have had so far! Dr. Poulin is enthusiastic about the subject and makes the class interesting. I would recommend her above the other BIO200 professors. I did not buy the book, but I did use the lecture guide.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	5	1170225	5/15/11	Poulin's section is probably the best out of the three Evo. Bio teachers. She is friendly and always willing to help you. Go to her office hours if you need help with anything. However, her tests are pretty challenging at times so make sure you do heavy preapration before her tests. Lab for this class will help boost your grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	4/13/11	Amazing professor! Very interesting lectures and she does a great job in making you understand. Please do take her, you'll not regret.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	1/10/11	DR. POULIN IS SUPERB! One of the best at UB for sure. She makes lectures interesting with anecdotes about her family or info about bizarre organisms. LISTEN TO LECTURE AUDIO POSTED ONLINE - she talks fast. Don't buy the lecture guide or "recommended" book. DON'T RELY ON CHEAT SHEETS - study REALLY hard to know the material and an A is yours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	2	4	1170225	12/22/10	This class isnt impossible but its hard and you really have to work to get an A. Youre allowed a tip sheet on every test which is nice and she records the lectures and puts it online. I would listen to the lectures even if you attended the class. I would recommend Poulin over all the other Bio 200 professors--shes approachable, fair, and funny.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	3	4	1170225	12/15/10	You guys are making this class seem impossible. Most of you are probably are not used to a class that requires SOME effort. I honestly treated this as a high school class and still manage to beat the average on every exam, and get a very good grade in lab; lab section is worth more than lecture. Cheat sheets make it pretty easy. Just takes effort.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	4	1170225	11/18/10	Best professor i've had, but you need to work for your grade.Tests are tricky but she gives you absolutely everything you need to do well (cheat sheet, practice tests, lecture guides, office hours ect), anyone who fails didn't try hard enough. Also hilarious and makes harry potter references on her test! makes a potentially boring class fascinatin
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	5	1170225	10/21/10	Hard tests (tricky), fun lecture, go over her stuff a few times and your good to go, lets you use a cheat sheet =]
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	4	1170225	8/8/10	Wonderful teacher. Does not require a textbook. Keeps lectures interesting and fun. Can have wordy test questions, but overall very fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	4	1170225	7/5/10	It's hard, but I think she's really working to prepare us for college and to *think* in a way I don't see with my other science courses. Just put in the time and you'll do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	4	1170225	4/11/10	Yes, this is a hard class. However, she is an amazing teacher and made the class really interesting, and I don't think i've ever learned so much from one class before. The poor ratings on here are probably those who got bad grades, it takes a LOT of work, but it's definitely possible to do well in her class if you put in the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	4	1170225	3/25/10	Interesting lecture, difficult labs, INSANE tests. This class is basically a weeder course. Be prepared to give up your social life or any remainder of it if you want a high grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	3	1170225	1/10/10	She really give you all the tools to succeed in her class. She video/audio records all her classes, holds reviews on fridays, gives practice questions on every section and provides previous exams. It is true her test are tricky, she loves to give long questions that tend to confuse most people, and frankly 50mins are not enough to take her exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	1	4	1	1170225	1/5/10	The material itself isn't overwhelming, it's her tests that are ridiculous. She is one of those teachers that is out to trick you with her tests, because they are all conceptual and really long, so that by the end of the question, you're more lost than you were before you read it. Don't take her class. It is a mind-boggler.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	3	1170225	1/2/10	First, study the lectures. Second, study the lectures. Thrid, study the lectures!!! Try to learn the test taking strategies before you take the exam. Sometimes you just have to guess what she will put the answer as. Very hard course&exams. Interesting lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	1	1170225	12/16/09	She is one of the hottest teachers hahaha, well anyway, her class is hard like any other bio class, but she lets us have a cheat sheet for each test, written out front and back of 1 regular sized piece of paper....do the appropriate studying and the class will be a piece of cake, also get the right TA and you'll be fine, since lab is 50% of grade
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	5	1170225	12/10/09	Dr. Poulin puts the "fun" in "fungi". She really should be a part-time comedian. Her lectures are really interesting and she always has a break in the middle. You don't even have to go to class because she posts the lectures online to watch. She's very intelligent and passionate about her subject. Tests are hard but there are Harry Potter reference
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	11/19/09	I think she is a great professor who actually cares about her students. She goes out of her way making sure everyone understands the material and makes herself available when you do not understand some part of the material. I recommend her to everyone! One of the best UB professors!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	3	1170225	11/15/09	good teacher, but test questions are really hard
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	4	1170225	11/5/09	provides everything you need to succeed
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	3	3	1170225	3/30/10	The material in the class is boring and the tests are insane, but she is a good teacher and i feel I learned allot from her. He is fun to listen to and passionate about the material. Know that this is a hard class and you will need to put in effort.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	4	1170225	2/9/10	She is a great teacher but you must put in alot of work too. Her lectures are very organized and interesting. She is very helpful in office hours. Her tests are difficult because you must pay close attention to detail and read quickly. In order to do well you have to listen to lecture multiple times, do practice questions and ask her for help
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	0	Biology	200	1	2	3	1170225	1/7/10	DO NOT take this class because it is impossible to pass ANY of her tests. After reading her test questions, you are completely lost and dont even know what she is asking in the first place.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	4	1170225	1/5/10	I agree that this class is all about knowing how to take her tests. First you need to know the material top to bottom, but most importantly you need to know how to take her tests. If you can score 10-15 points above average on all the exams then you have a good shot at an A/A-.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	1	3	4	1170225	12/21/09	Do NOT take this professor. No matter how well you know the material her tests test your ability to take tests, not your knowledge of the subject.This is coming from someone who is most likely going to end up with an A in this class and I wouldn't take her again no matter what.Her lecture may be intersting but her tests are incredibly tricky.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	5	4	1170225	12/10/09	She's the "easy" professor of the three that teach BIO 200. That said, this course is very hard! She's very reasonable though and genuinely wants students to succeed. My only complaint is that she sometimes asks very abstract or obscure questions on the exam. We don't even have the dreaded lab practical. Do your work, overall a very good choice!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	1	3	1	1170225	12/7/09	it's really hard to rate Dr Poulin because she is incredible but is gauged with teaching a really hard course. She is so funny and incorporates little stories about her family in the lectures along with great pics. Exams are hard and ppl complain but go sit in on Fourtners lectures I know i did and after i thanked god for Dr Poulin.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	1	1	5	1170225	11/16/09	This teacher is the by far the worst teacher I have ever seen. I'm passing the course but even so her exams are a *!@#, they have nothing to do with class. She easily takes down any aspiring doctors, if u have a choice dont take her. IDK what these other people say but this is definately not a teacher a freshman should take.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	3	1170225	11/12/09	Dr. Poulin is one of the few professors that can keep my attention for the entire class period. Her lectures are organized well and engaging, and her stretch breaks allow you to reset your brain. Her tests are extremely wordy and require some critical thinking, but hey, it's college. The labs are completely useless, you won't learn anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	4	2	1170225	11/4/09	Professor Poulin is an excellent teacher and made a typically boring class rather interesting. Although the course material isn't extremely interesting, Poulin teaches TO you instead of AT you. Text book not required and lectures are posted online. Exams are inferential instead of straight fact and are not easy. However, a notes sheet is permitted.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	3	3	1170225	10/20/09	Dr. Poulin is a great professor and really knows what she's talking about as well as making little jokes to keep it fun. She talks insanely fast which makes it hard to take notes but the lectures are recorded so you can go back to them later. You won't use the book at all, don't bother buying it. Lab was easy but TAs Justin & Eneda were awful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	3	1170225	8/5/09	Exams are VERY WORDY. She'd put info that is irrevelant to mislead & waste most of the 50 mins that u have for the exam. Can always follow up with audio recordings for lectures, but don't rely on it (technology problems). Study everything from lecture cuz she writes lectures ahead, word-for-word,& reads it w/emphasis. class knocks out Doc wannabes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	1/26/09	She is the best! The lecture is very fun and you can make alot friends in the class. If you need help, she is always there for you. I Highly recommend you to take her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	4	3	1170225	12/22/08	Evolutionary Bio is not an easy course. Dr. Poulin put the uber-specific terms and details she mentioned in lecture on the exams, while the more difficult things in the book hardly ever showed up. No need to go to lectures - just listen to them online, but know those lectures WELL, the info will be on the exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	12/9/08	She is a great profesor with awesome teaching skill!! She is extremely helpful and nice!! Make sure to choose her section if you are going to take BIO 200!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	4	1170225	12/5/08	Very clear when teaching. She added interesting details and stories in class to keep us energized and help us remember facts. I looked forward to going to class, because I knew Dr. Poulin would not simply restate information of out the textbook. Her tests, which were fair, reflected what was taught in class. Take her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	1	1	3	1170225	11/22/08	While she is a great teacher and speaker as well, she makes her tests extremely hard and most of the questions are about tiny insignificant things compared to her lectures. Also, she has different terminology for things in the lab manual so you have to learn both terminologies. Notes r useless, just study from the lab manual and listen to lecture
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	11/20/08	Best professor I've had yet! Lectures are extremely interesting! Exams are fine as long as you study!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1170225	11/13/08	Amazing teacher! Easy to follow keeps class interesting!! TAKE HER!! You will love her!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	11/11/08	lectures are interesting and she keeps them short enough that you don't loose interest. very helpful and willing to help you outside of class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	5	5	5	1170225	9/11/09	very clear and concise. a lot of material but she creates outlines only had her for a few weeks now but shes pretty good. also very attractive
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	4	1170225	6/29/09	Pretty much the best professor to have for this class. However, that does not mean she is easy. Tests are HARD and you will have to devote hours upon hours of study time. This is a weed-out course to discourage Freshmen who want to major in Biological Sciences but AREN'T WILLING TO PUT IN THE WORK! Good riddance in my opinion ;-)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	4	1170225	1/16/09	The class is insanely hard to begin with. People say she's a great lecturer, I don't see it. Passed out most days even with a cup of coffee. Her tests will contain questions that she may glance by ONCE in lecture. I bombed every test, probably even the final, but manage to catch a curve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	3	1170225	12/21/08	Dr. Poulin is awesome! She's fun and makes class enjoyable. Go to class, take notes and go to her office hours if you have questions. If you have to take BIO200 take it with her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	5	5	3	1170225	12/6/08	omg Poulin is HILARIOUS!! Such a good professor, lectures are really interesting and her tests are really fair. Go out of your way to have her, she is amazing!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	1	1170225	12/2/08	Coolest teacher i've ever had she is very excited to be there which makes it better for you. You will not need to look at the textbook at all just go to lecture. Tests are on lecture however questions aren't just repeat what she told you .... they make you think, (welcome to college)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	4	3	1170225	11/21/08	She is an excellent speaker, speaks w/crystal clear quality. Her exams are harder than you would expect. As previously mentioned by others, she hardly have questions on things she emphasized upon. Tests can be hard, but u would need to read the text as well as attend all lectures in order to get an A.U won't get bored in her class. I highly recomme
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	1	Biology	200	2	3	1	1170225	11/18/08	nice teacher, short classes, easy going personality. her tests don't match up with her notes. she tests on what she says in her lectures - stuff she does NOT emphasize in class. Her notes don't prepare you for anything! this something hard to handle for some like me because i take written work more seriously than what is lightly covered verbally.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	1	4	1	1170225	11/13/08	Brilliant teacher, actually knows what she is doing. However, her tests don't correlate well to the practice questions. Average is around a 60 and she says there were be no curve. My only gripe is that she seems to over-emphasize things, but not test them... rather she tested on the less discussed topics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	5	5	5	1170225	11/9/08	This professor is extremely helpful. She knows what she is talking about and she makes class so interesting! By far the best evolutionary bio teacher at UB! Her tests are very fair; they're easy enough to not have a curve. I highly recommend her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	4	4	1170225	11/7/08	Teaches very well and in a fun way too! e.g. C if for conifers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	101	3	5	4	1170225	10/18/08	Dr. Poulin is truly a wonderful teacher. She's passionate about the subject material and makes class very interesting. Also very funny and down to earth.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	1	1170225	9/29/08	I absolutely despise Biology and most science courses. Dr. Poulin actually makes Biology interesting. THAT makes a great teacher. Good Job! Two thumbs up.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	9/16/08	Dr. Poulin is great. She explains everything clearly, and she is eager to answer student's questions. By far my favorite teacher this semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	5	4	1170225	9/9/08	Dr. Poulin is amazing. She makes Bio super fun and is always engaging and concise. I've only had her class for less than 3 weeks but I know I'm going to enjoy going there! Get in her class at all costs and make sure to sit in the front!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	3	4	2	1170225	10/30/08	AWESOME!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	1170225	10/12/08	One word: Awesome.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	101	3	4	4	1170225	9/26/08	i've never had a bio teacher that actually knew what she was talking about, but you do and you make it fun
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	5	5	1170225	9/10/08	she is great!!! she is funny, to the point and extremely willing to answer questions immediately if there are any. if you're going to take bio, try to get her. you wont regret it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Poulin	4.5	2	Biology	200	4	4	5	1170225	8/31/08	Best bio teacher at UB thus far.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cesar Pozzobon	4.3	2	Languages	101	2	5	5	782959	1/14/08	He is an amazing professor, and one of the best I've ever had. Although learning language is difficult, he makes it very fun and humerous. I would HIGHLY recommend this teacher. He's really awesome. I took him in 2006, and I'm very sad to hear he'll be leaving.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cesar Pozzobon	4.3	0	Languages	104	2	2	4	782959	7/1/06	Wasn't good for 104 jumped around and the pace went to fast... he wasn't very helpful...not to mention he did a oral quiz where he asked you questions in front of EVERYONE
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cesar Pozzobon	4.3	2	Languages	101	3	5	5	782959	4/12/06	Great guy. Class is fun.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cesar Pozzobon	4.3	2	Languages	102	3	5	5	782959	5/26/07	Cesare is an amazing professor. I almost cried when he said he was leaving and I had to continue my Italian learning without him. I miss Cesare, he was the best Italian teacher I have ever had. He made the class very fun and you wanted to be there every class.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	525	2	4	2	77055	4/8/13	Price is a tough teacher with real-world experience. Although the homeworks and exam are tricky, he is willing to help any chance he can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	3	5	4	77055	9/8/11	Best professor I have ever had, hands down. Engaging, enlightening, captivating. Take his class. This man is a genius.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	2	5	4	77055	5/10/11	Despite what others say, I found Price to be more entertaining than obnoxious. His lectures were interesting and the writing assignments were nothing too bad. The multiple choice tests made me very angry though, for they were based on the thick volumes of reading assigned and not the notes from class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	525	2	1	5	77055	11/25/10	Professor lacks ability to convey difficult material. Advanced subject matter is not clarified, and he provides little assistance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	2	3	3	77055	7/26/10	Buy the book and make sure you read the chapters given to you in the syllabus because the test questions are right from the book! Kind of crazy old guy who's really interested in what he teaches. A lot of movies that are pointless but you may get to write about them for an essay question. You don't have to go to class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	5	3	1	77055	1/10/10	Really wasnt bad at all... you go to lecture and take notes on what he talks about the exams are super easy....
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	312	2	4	5	77055	1/2/10	I read a lot of negative comments about his class, but I think he's a really cool professor. I took his PD212 class too; his teaching and expectations has been the same. The class is not easy readings are required but I think his lectures make it worth it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	5	3	77055	12/20/09	Great Porfessor, really knows his material! Go to class, get the notes, and READ THE BOOK, and you'll easily get an A in this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	2	3	1	77055	12/14/09	This man is a genius, he really knows what he is talking about. His exams are unfair and do not test what he teaches in class, it almost completely comes from the book. If there is another professor take them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	2	5	4	77055	10/3/09	Man is a genius. Usually in the Urban Planning department, I would be amazed if he didn't have at least one degree in the Social Sciences or History. You do need the book and to take notes in lecture but unless you don't believe in evolution you should find him engaging and interesting. The TA's and recitation are hit or miss.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	312	3	4	3	77055	11/30/12	Class material covered is interesting. He adds "life" to his lectures and walks around and doesn't just stand at the computer. There is a semester long project that will take a lot of time to get done. But he does allow redos until you are happy with your grade. Only thing about the class is that his exams are tough and detailed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	2	4	5	77055	7/2/11	Shocked to see all of these negative comments!! My favorite professor from the semester. He was very interesting. Have to put some effort in to pass but good morning, you're in college.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	510	5	1	3	77055	12/11/10	It is nice that the university hired a person with low self-esteem, but his ability to teach and treat students in a civil manner is a big zero. All he does in class is rattle on about how you can't learn planning from some bookish PhD. Wow. Guess what, Price is not a PhD and hasn't worked as a planner in 30 years. He is a dud, and angry about it!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	1	Architecture	312	1	1	5	77055	7/28/10	very interesting professor but expects WAY too much of his students. The project and exams were very difficult even though i always paid attention in class and took good notes. he doesnt give any other opportunity to show that you understand the material (no quizzes or homework to help raise your grade) OVERALL- LOVED THE CLASS BUT HATED THE PROF
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	212	1	1	1	77055	2/28/10	HE IS HORRIBLE, TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO FAIL
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	4	1	77055	1/9/10	Makes the class interesting. 2 multiple choice exams, 1 short answer/essay midterm, 1 multiple choice final. HW and quizzes depend on your TA (some TAs don't give HW but will give quizzes instead). 1 final paper (5-7 pages?).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	1	Architecture	111	2	2	1	77055	12/27/09	hard teacher. I'm a straight A student and got a B in this class. His tests are based solely on the book and he doesn't hand them back so you know what you got wrong. TAs are hard too..they grade the mandatory 5 page research paper way too harshly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	212	3	1	4	77055	12/18/09	I took this class because I wanted to major in planning. The first thing this professor told us was that we couldn't major in planning at UB because UB offered a different degree in drawing, or something like that. The professor was difficult to follow and not very nice to students. I visited him in his office and he was drinking whisky. Yuk!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	212	2	1	1	77055	11/1/09	Hetalked down to the class a lot like we couldnt follow rules or understand basic things. He thinks what comes out of his mouth is the most amazing enlightening thing ever. He talks about his experience in the subject which is outdated. Brought his cell phone. TAs were nice but both had diff grading scales, it screwed me over. If u take him gl.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	212	5	1	5	77055	7/31/09	Major power trip. Can't relate to students. Tells stories about his personal experience and refuses to correct his mistakes. Self-Centered. Smells of booze (especially when in his office). Nothing learned in his class. Waste of time. Run from this guy's classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	212	5	1	3	77055	5/21/09	I am shocked that this guy is still teaching. The 'professor' (no Ph.D., so he isn't really a real professor)just told personal stories about his days as a planner in the 1970s, talked about his dog, danced in front of class and told unfunny jokes. I can't believe the University pays this guy over 100K a year to perpetrate this fraud.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	220	4	5	5	77055	4/20/09	The lectures are interesting and the papers he assign are easy. He puts notes on the overhead. First and third exam are multiple choice, second exam is an essay. The tests are based on the textbook however the textbook chapters do not correspond to the daily lectures he teach. However if you want to score a good grade on the exams Do read the text!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	5	4	77055	1/22/09	I agree, don't buy the book unless you read alot. Just fill out your study guides and attend lectures, your all set! Unfortunately no curves, so what you get is what you get.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	312	1	4	3	77055	12/9/08	Tough grader and gives a lot of assigned reading. He is a very good lecturer and usually has a lot of interesting things to say. Sometimes can be a little aggressive.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	5	3	77055	11/13/08	He is a very well educated man. Loves history and loves teaching it. Very clear and understandable. Lecture material can be boring, but he makes it as interesting as he can. Funny from time to time. Easy class if you review the notes and read before exams. DO NEED A BOOK (typically used in recitation). I recommend him (unless easier prof. found).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	112	5	1	1	77055	5/6/08	The worst class in my experience. The professor is a windbag and a dud. I got an A- in the class, but would rather take it from someone else and get a lower grade. A waste of time and tuition.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	112	1	1	1	77055	5/4/08	Terrible!!!!nvr tke this guy!!!NEVER
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	101	5	1	3	77055	4/24/08	The professor likes to hear his own voice and doesn't like students. He had a big head. The exams are right out of the textbook. Just fill in the dots. I wouldn't recommend the professor if you expect to learn anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	111	5	1	3	77055	3/14/08	Has a high opinion of himself. I have heard him yell at students. Talks down to people. Rude. The class is about learning his opinions. I don't know why they let him around students. Run for the door if you enroll in his classes and don't turn back.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	5	5	5	77055	12/9/07	DONT BUY THE BOOK. you don't need it as long as you come to lecture. he has pre-typed overhead slides that he uses. just taking notes can pass you. great teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	2	5	4	77055	4/26/09	Price is s very passionate and good teacher. He loves what he does and is good at it. I recommend him for anybody who wants to or needs to take this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	212	2	5	5	77055	4/18/09	I Love this Professor!!! I have taken every class he teaches at the school, he's extremely inteligent and always willing to share his knowledge. I strongly recommend his class if you actually want to learn something and not just get a grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	111	2	1	1	77055	12/31/08	hate his ways of teaching. he always speaks down to us. it made me soo frustrated that i barely went to his lectures. thank god he wasnt my TA or i would have dropped this course. hated hated hated it. he acts like this course if vital to our lives, and doesnt seem to realize were only here cuz we HAVE to be. soo lame.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	5	5	4	77055	11/21/08	This teacher is great, he's a very emotional and powerful speaker. I loved this guy from day one, he makes the material so easy to learn and retain especially with the notes he makes you take every day. The tests are on the notes, notes are taken daily (you will get writers cramp), and the TA's are great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	101	5	1	5	77055	6/11/08	Price is the most dishonest person I ever met. He told me my grade was one thing at the end of the semester and gave me a lower grade on the report card. I asked about it and he denied ever giving me a higher grade. He lied all the way up the line. I endured a semester of his boring lectures and offensive comments, and in the end got shafted.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	112	2	4	4	77055	5/5/08	Yes, this guy is outspoken about his views in class but that doesn't take anything away from the quality of his classes. He is an outstanding professor, extremely bright, and fair in the workload he assigns. If you are a serious student (meaning if you care at all about your education), don't hesitate to take a class or two with this guy. He's good
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	100	5	1	3	77055	4/29/08	The world civ. TA saved me in this class. He told me the professor was not very accessible, and he was right. I tired to visit the professor in his office several times to discuss my grades and he was never there. One time I found him there in the late afternoon and he was in his office drinking somthing that looked like a cocktail. Ouch!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	100	3	1	3	77055	4/16/08	NEVER take this guys class. He is the worst professor at UB. He does not like students, says insensitive things in class. For a guy who claims to be so smart, he sure doesn't know how to talk to people. He should turn off his cell phone during class, it is a give away about his disrespect for tuition paying students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	5	3	77055	1/14/08	Not the easiest World Civ teacher. He was very clear in teaching and his antics in class kept me attentive. I would strongly reccommend taking him if you are willing to do a little bit of work for an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	112	2	2	1	77055	4/26/07	I hate this teacher to the guts! I won't recommend him as a teacher. Way too much work to do; tests, mid-term, final, and term paper (10 pages). Don't take him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	5	2	77055	12/9/06	Price gives lectures that will keep you awake in class, they are actually rather intresting even though I'm not a huge fan of history. My only complaint is that he takes the class a little too seriously for a gen ed. You have to work to get an A, but it is possible to get it.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	111	4	1	4	77055	4/6/05	very very biased. loves to hear himself talk. wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa woh wee wa wo wa. Doesn't speak french well. He doesn't play, he once broke a stereo because it played. Not for people on the right of the political spectrum.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	112	3	5	3	77055	11/11/04	An interesting prof. Doesn't make you sleep really if you are interested even a little in history type of classes. Just come to class to take notes and listen to what he says because the tests are based on those and the text. Term paper is 10-pages long tho. So be prepared. And lotsa reading too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	312	3	3	4	77055	11/4/04	Very good lecturer, but tends to act like every little thing is mind blowing. Princeton grad so he's extremely bright, does have a bit of arrogance to him but he is pretty smart and overall he is a nice guy, tests can be difficult but nothing that is not in your notes. Just study your notes!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	111	3	2	4	77055	11/2/04	Boring, repetitive, and opinionated. Poor text book is also used for this course, which make matters worse. Tests are moderately diffcult and often tricky. He is the master of circular reasoning while lecturing. You don't learn anything in the lectures. Chris Lanham is a good TA, get him for rec.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	1112	4	1		77055	4/27/04	First semester wasn't that bad, it's not a difficult class. UGC 112 was a different story the man is arrogant and feels that his opinions are far superior to anything or anyone else. Many of his comments can be seen as offensive.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	5		77055	1/3/04	He is passionate about what he teaches and is amicable. His tests are tricky though, especially when they are short ans/essay rather than multiple choice. He will also test you on things he didn't emphasize in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	112	3	5		77055	11/3/03	He's a great teacher and has some really interesting personal stories, but don't expect him to go easy on you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	4		77055	10/24/03	hard but very fair, doesnt ask any dumb questions nobody would know on a test
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	3	1	77055	6/20/06	an A is attainable but u have to work 4 it. personally thought the class was too much work for a gen ed (essay midterm, term paper). tests were kind or difficult but final is easy. go to class or else u'll waste a lot of time reading the book. loves hearing himself talk and makes u feel dumb if u have him for recitation (i did)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111112	3	3	3	77055	8/31/05	Very interesting lectures. Not a very dificult teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	4	4	77055	12/6/04	fun teacher, lectures are interesting and not many notes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	112	3	1	4	77055	11/11/04	Very biased teacher overall..taught a lot of propaganda rather than history at points during the course. Arrogant: I suspect paper grades depend on one's acceptance of his opinion.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	5	2	77055	11/4/04	Price is very thorough on the material, and is also quite amusing at times. My experience with him as my UGC 111 professor was excellent. He makes you think, keeps you interested, and did an excellent job of teaching the course. Not an easy task with a Gen. Ed. course =p
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	5		77055	5/19/04	He's very helpful and he's keeps things interesting, and generally he picks good TAs. I had him for both 112 and 112 and he was excellent. One of the best Teacher's I've ever had.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	211	3	3		77055	4/12/04	Class sucked
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	1	Architecture	111	2	3		77055	11/29/03	I do not like his test...they are hard.. however, his lectures are interesting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	2	3		77055	10/30/03	Good Teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	4	4		77055	10/7/03	He's a good prof, but he really teaches down to his students... He acts like everything he tells his students is blowing their mind, and he's full of awesome radical concepts, when in fact he's not.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	111	3	5		77055	9/11/03	passionate about the subject- and it shows in his teaching. lectures can be boring, but hey, it's history. good guy - defn. recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	0	Architecture	111	1	1		77055	6/18/03	Worst teacher I have ever had at UB, Treats all his students like pre-K students, assumes all of them have never written a research paper, he is rude to his own class speakers by never showing up to class, decides that his using a cellphone in class is ok

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Al Price	3.4	2	Architecture	312	2	4		77055	11/5/02	Good teacher, quite funny. He needs to keep his political views out of classroom
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Adrianna Primo-Vincent	2.5	1	Languages	151	3	3	4	949503	1/18/07	Instructor was a very skilled Spanish speaker but moved at a pace that was much too fast for the students. This may have been due to time constraints but it was nearly impossible to keep up with her. She rushed through the lecture material. On one occasion she chastised student in front of everyone in the class for several minutes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	5	4	1481620	4/27/12	She's a great English teacher, and she's caring just like a sister. She's gives excellent explanations, good examples, and generous grades. Attendance is mandatory, but attending her class just worth it because it's fun!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	5	5	1481620	12/29/11	Very good and understanding teacher. You will have many opportunities to do extra credit. Its an easy A for sure if you take her class and simply do you tast. Its easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	4	5	1481620	11/29/11	One of the best teachers ever. The essays are really short, and you are allowed to get so much extra credit. If you fail this class is because you wanted to because it is impossible to fail here. We watched alot of movies and if you need ESL and you don't take her then that will be the biggest mistake you ever did. :)!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	5	5	1481620	11/11/11	I went to her class and did the homework that she gave us, I got A since she gives legit A+ for every essays. She is super nice, but behave well, and try to answer questions. If u have her, it will be a blast. PERIOD.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	4	4	4	1481620	1/23/11	Many EXTRA CREDITs given! Last year I got 20 bonus points for going to her show and write a 2pg essay about it.. She is extremely nice and helpful, just like a friend.. Feel free to ask her about anything on facebook/via email/after class! U would definitely enjoy her class! Helpful and interesting, no pressure. Free discussion and great atmosphere

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	5	4	1481620	4/27/12	She is the best teacher for essay writing. She gives excellent explanation, good examples, and answer students questions very well. She's very good teaching grammar, and makes you aware of the grammatical mistakes that you usually take for granted. She offers lots of extra credit, so it's a waste of time if you don't get A for her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Emilie Pryor	4.7	2	English	407	5	5	5	1481620	12/9/11	BEST TEACHER EVER. If you take Emily Pryor's ESL class, I'm sure you will get A.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	5	5	3	463560	12/16/12	Easy class, easy professor. Can sometimes be hard to understand, but definitely recommended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	636	5	5	5	463560	4/24/12	I have learned a great deal from Dr. Poon. She makes herself clear of she wants you to do. She is highly respectable in the field and I had the pleasure to study with her. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography		5	5	5	463560	7/11/11	one of the greatest lecturers who is always willing to lend a helping hand in whatever the circumstances that the students face, and on top of that a great sport to be with.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	3	4	4	463560	12/24/10	Hands down best economics teacher. Don't bother using the textbook; all 4 exams are all based on her powerpoint slides. Go to class, she takes random attendances that count toward your grade. Drops one exam. Responds to email promptly. Great professor who uses her experience in geography and translates it to class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	5	5	3	463560	12/5/09	Incredibly easy class if you go and take notes. I never even bought the book, and did well. There are 4 tests and she drops the lowest one, so I got to skip the last 1/4 of the class because I got A's on the first three. She takes attendance randomly, but you should be in class anyway since she gives exam questions out during lecture. Good elective
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	3	5	2	463560	3/31/08	She is a very good teacher, she gives plenty of examples in class. she teaches on the overheard and posts her notes in class. She does not post notes on UBLearns. you have to go to the TA's office hours and sit there and hand write them if you missed the notes in class, i would bring your laptop and type your notes. don't bother buying the book

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	1	Geography	103	5	3	3	463560	9/23/04	She is very cute!! Little asian lady with a phd, very intelligent and has traveled everywhere! Never ANY homework, just some reading.. good professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	460	3	4	3	463560	7/28/12	Fantastic Professor. The best I had during my time at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	4	5	5	463560	9/1/11	Great Professor! If I had a chance I'll take classes with her again! I love her class! she makes the class really interesting and the most important you really learn the topics. I definitely recommend her! She is a great professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	101	5	5	5	463560	7/11/11	highly motivational and interesting lecturer who goes beyond traditional framework of theories into research applicable to realities. lessons are open to discussions and debates and are hardly a bore to the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	4	5	5	463560	12/14/10	One of the best professors I have had at UB! She is an amazing person to talk to. I highly recommend Dr. Poon.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	103	3	5	3	463560	4/9/08	I took this course because I needed a liberal arts gen ed. She is a really nice lady, but her class is kinda boring. I suppose that economic geography is a boring topic, but it fit into my schedule. Tests difficult, I think, for a freshman course. Goes kinda fast as far as her slides are concerned, be prepared to keep up. Overall, she's okay.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	425	4	5	5	463560	3/3/07	VERY businesslike attitude, but not at all mean. Knows economic geo like no one else. Down-to-earth, fast, clear teaching style. Fantastic professor. And no textbook, yay!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessie Poon	4.6	2	Geography	460	4	5	5	463560	9/13/05	Really smart professor, very clear in thought, I would definitely recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martin Pops	4.3	1	English	334	3	3	4	219487	12/18/05	Amusing, yes. Rambler, definitely. He's interesting, but I won't take another class with him. Half sheet of paper with the names of five books and "Midterm, endterm, 10 pg paper" = syllabus. No dates or anything. Vague in response to questions.. or his answers seem like they're in response to an entirely different question than the one asked.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martin Pops	4.3	2	English		5	4	5	219487	8/31/05	great great teaacher, made me really love Twain once again, take his class and enjoy it!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martin Pops	4.3	2	English	334	3	5		219487	6/6/03	This guy is a blast. He will have an epiphany, and then deliver these funny little soliloquies in class, very interesting and amusing guy. True example of a well spoken fellow with a poetic tongue, so rare in the world these days.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martin Pops	4.3	1	English	333	3	3	4	219487	12/17/05	Fun and amusing guy, but he rambles. Basically no syllabus so there's nothing to keep him on track. Not the easiest grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Martin Pops	4.3	2	English		3	5	4	219487	6/2/05	I took classes with him a while back but he was one of the BEST professors I've ever had. He is an inspirational factor to my wanting to become a professor. He is a genius in his own right.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Olga  Posse	3.0	2	Criminal Justice		1	5	5	1801044	4/11/13	Very good!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Olga  Posse	3.0	0	Criminal Justice		3	1	3	1801044	3/7/13	Having online classes it is necessary for email communication but this professor does not care at all to respond EVER. She does not care about her students at all. If you have a problem with her do not even bother trying to go to her, you need to go straight above her. Horrible personal experience and I know many other people who had the same too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	JM Potter	3.6	1	Philosophy	337	3	3	3	1359850	12/16/11	Grades are based on attendance, three exams, pop quizzes and a debate. The debate is at the end of the semester. He doesn't give many guidelines but it isn't difficult. He confuses himself a lot and his notes are confusing and hard to follow. The readings for every class that are long and confusing. But as long as you study the exams are do-able.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	JM Potter	3.6	2	Philosophy	107	2	5	4	1359850	3/22/10	Excellent instructor. Very straightfoward class with excelent discussions and moderate diffuculty grading wise. The instructor has demonstrated good knowledge of ethics and I would reccomend him to anyone looking to take an intro to ethics class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	JM Potter	3.6	0	Philosophy	337	1	3	1	1359850	6/21/10	Gives long quizzes, complex articles, often confuses himself during lecture. Would NOT recommend!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	JM Potter	3.6	2	Philosophy	107	3	5	1	1359850	1/2/10	Fairly straight forward course. 5 quizzes + final, Three 3pg papers. Quizzes were straight from lecture w/review sheets for every quiz. Papers were generally straight forward and easy to write. Lectures were pretty interesting with lots of examples. Great professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	2	5	5	5	1237951	8/16/12	amazing guy and interesting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	1237951	3/21/12	Dr. P is a great guy - he's funny, engaging, and extremely interesting to listen to. Compared with the psych professors my friends had, he's probably the coolest and easiest professor. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK - as long as you show up to class and take notes. As far as studying goes, all I did was review the notes the night before. Highly recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	5	3	1237951	2/10/12	Probably one of the only classes I go to and actually listen and take notes. He's mad fun, and a pretty chill dude. Tests are confusing but as long as you go to class and listen you should be fine. Tell your friends, good class to take.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	5	5	4	1237951	3/29/11	easy to understand even I am an international. Extremely fun at class, and tests are not hard as long as you attend the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	0	Psychology	101	1	1	1	1237951	1/16/10	I studied so hard for every exam and got real low grades. he gave me a D+ which is very upsetting. I do not recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	1237951	12/8/09	He is a nice guy. You can get an A if you do mot miss classes. Especially, you can drop the lowest scores out of 4 exams and no final. It is a great oppurtunity to meet him to study psy 101.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	3	1	1237951	11/23/09	He's a cool dude..but his class can be incredibly boring, and it doesn't help that it is offered at 9:30 AM. You can read the text book, basing the info on his provided empty power point slides, and fill in the blanks to study for your test...tests are tricky and I recommend studying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	3	4	1237951	11/1/09	Kool teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	0	Psychology	101	1	1	5	1237951	10/13/09	horrible teacher, I hated him his lectures are boring and slow and the tests were so B/s. He would give you a study guide and none of that crap was on there. I had his wife for biology and she was the same way at least she was eye candy so it made the lectures more tolerable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	5	5	3	1237951	6/4/09	Class moved somewhat slow. He gives a study guide that might as well just be the test before each exam. Nice guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	4	5	1237951	4/27/12	He is the coolest professor ever! He plays music every time before the class started, and deliver his lecture with great enthusiasm. His class is not mandatory, but do attend if you want to perform well. He gives excellent explanation and examples which is easy to understand. Plus, he likes to make small experiment in class. It's fun!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	1237951	3/8/12	Very helpful and nice guy. Exams are based on lectures not the book. Attendance is not mandatory but you should go if you want to do well on the exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology		3	5	3	1237951	5/16/11	Had Poulin for 101 and for Stress & Coping. I LOVE this guy. He's REALLY friendly, straightforward, loves to find answers to student questions, makes class interesting. You get what you put into a class. Pay attention, don't rely just on the ppt outlines - it's worth it. He's a great teacher. Take anything you can with him if psych interests you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	3	4	4	1237951	6/7/10	I feel as though for PSY 101 he is one of the harder teachers. His tests are super confusing, you REALLY have to know the answer. This is annoying because the material is easy, the questions are just hard. While his lecture was interesting I recommend finding and easier 101 Prof.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	1	Psychology	101	2	3	2	1237951	1/12/10	Hes too hard compared to other easier psychology 101 courses. I underestimated this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	3	4	1237951	12/2/09	Dr. P is an excellent professor. His lectures aren't too boring, he makes slide shows and puts it online for people who wants to type the notes. You come to class to fill out the notes.. it's that simple. 4 exams, no homework or quizzes. Study the notes = ace the exams. He's relateable with a sense of humor. I would suggest him to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	4	4	1237951	11/8/09	Very good lecturer, his class followed a logical order and he gave lots of relevant examples and demonstrations to back up his points in class. Exams were all multiple-choice and easy as can be. However, the 7 MANDATORY research sign-ups / summary papers are terrible (not his idea, all PSY101 classes have it as a req.)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology		4	4	4	1237951	10/30/09	very entertaining lectures, cares about his subject and his students. Go to lectures and read the book and you'll do fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	1	Psychology	101	2	3	3	1237951	8/22/09	I don't really see what the big deal is. He's one of those teachers that believe if you know everything, then you'll do well. So he makes a study guide and asks you study a ton of stuff and half of it doesn't actually show up on the test. He was ok, but you'll get a better grade with Gabriel/Henning.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	5	4	1237951	4/10/09	He is a awesome teacher ! attend the lectures! you will be fine!!!!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Poulin	4.1	2	Psychology	101	4	4	3	1237951	2/26/09	COOL, YOUNG, UNDERSTANDABLE
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	101	2	5	4	748819	10/17/10	Very willing to help out after class, quizzes every wednesday on vocab, and friday on concepts.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	102	4	5	3	748819	3/24/08	Great Professor, excellent sense of humor and teaching style. If your going to take Latin 101 and 102 this is the professor you want!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	111	5	5	2	748819	12/23/05	AWESOME TA, you will feel like you are in heaven if you have her for history as a TA, she's funny, interesting and her quizes are mad easy, she basically goes over the answers before she gives the quizes and she's a wonderful lecturer who puts a zing to storytelling with her wit and humor. all i can say is AWESOME, AWESOME
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	111	4	5	2	748819	11/9/05	Poyer is intelligent,has a great sense of humor and recitation is always full of interesting stories regarding the topic. No complaints here.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	101	4	5	4	748819	4/9/09	Elizabeth is great- she truly cares about her students and will go out of her way to give extra points when needed. She is very fair and has a great teaching technique. She is funny, helpful, and extremely intelligent. I highly recommend if you are going to take Latin 101 or 102!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	111	4	5	4	748819	1/17/06	Ms. Poyer is by far a great TA. Like the people above me said, she's funny, has an awesome personality, and really knows her stuff. Her stories are pretty intresting too. If you can get her as a TA, you'll love her!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Poyer	4.9	2	Classics	111	3	5	3	748819	12/9/05	Funniest TA EVA!! And one of the smartest. I wish I could carry a pocket-sized Elizabeth with me wherever I go and pull her out for various purposes: jokes on a bad day, answers to various tests (the breadth of her knowledge knows no bounds!), general conversation on the minutia of college living. I insist on taking every course she ever teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	5	3	4	905620	12/10/12	He is very difficult to understand. Would not have gotten through this course without AP. There are clickers for attendance. He is good at working through problems, but his words are so unclear.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	1	Physics	101	5	4	2	905620	10/13/12	This teacher is pretty incomprehensible, but his notes are so well done that it makes up for it. He gives you every single formula and is very very helpful. He will try to help you on a one to one bases as much as he can. Really nice. Curve is outrageous (a 72 is an A and a 38 is a C+). So he is very easy grader. Plus phy101 is not a hard class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	2	Physics	307	3	4	4	905620	5/3/12	Gives very specific and helpful criticism for Modern Physics Lab. Has high expectations at beginning of semester, but then relaxes as the semester goes on. Pre-lab work is important.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	2	Physics	307	2	4	4	905620	5/24/10	I took a modern physics lab from Pralle. He has high standards but makes sure to help everybody get started & comfortable with the experiment.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	2	Physics	307	3	5	4	905620	2/20/10	At first I was not doing very well in this class, but I found Dr. Pralle was very patient and understanding and he definitely helped me improve
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	1	1	4	905620	12/13/07	I don't care if he's a doctor or not...you can't understand him and I didn't learn anything from him, which made PHY 101 very hard the whole semester because I had to teach myself. Do not pick this professor I beg you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	1	Physics	101	2	3	3	905620	10/27/07	course is pretty hard, especially for ones with no experience with the level of physics being taught. major problem with this professor is his 'deutsch' accent which is sometimes quite incomprehensible. moreover, this class demands a lot of work for a 101 course. there are weekly quizzes & hw which are beneficial but a mind-numbing experience.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	151	1	1	2	905620	1/8/07	Went to class around 1/2 the time. If you're good at math, do the homework and go over the homework answers posted on blackboard and you'll do fine. As far as the professor goes, if you're looking for an excuse to never go to class, take him because he wont teach you a thing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	2	1	1	905620	12/29/06	impossible to understand. i never went to class because all i heard was mumbling for a full hour. if you're going to take physics, use another professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	2	1	2	905620	10/20/12	he makes no sense... ever
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	1	Physics		4	2	4	905620	10/11/12	If you enjoy spending your afternoons utterly bewildered listening about the "theatr" and watching monkeys being shot out of the air, all the while not learning jack about physics. Then Arnd is the man for you!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	2	Physics	101	4	3	2	905620	1/12/12	He is super easy. got 65, 60 and 55 on all three exams and still ended up with a B+. Just do good on the quizes and homeworks and your pass no problem.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	2	Physics	307	2	5	4	905620	3/25/10	Dr. Pralle was extremely helpful and easy to understand. I learned a lot from him in this course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	1	Physics	101	1	4	1	905620	5/16/08	Well, he's not a bad guy. I got a 109 and on the first exam. a 49 on the second and an 89 on the final. I did probably one-eight of the homework, took 7 quizzes when I was supposed to take 13 and have the best 10 count. I hardly went to class so I lost clicker points and still talked to him and pulled off an A-. Reasonable guy. Tough academically.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	2	1	1	905620	11/8/07	terrible teacher terrible class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	1	1	1	905620	10/15/07	One of the worst teachers i've ever had..Physics was my favorite subject in high school and now i hate it more than anything..hes from germany and hes awful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	1	2	1	905620	1/3/07	Horrible teacher. I went to class the first 3 weeks and realized he was hopeless. It wasn't worth the extra credit to go. I'm not being lazy. It honestly wasn't worthwhile...he explained nothing. This was my first grade in the C range in my whole life. Avoid taking him at all class. My TA was utterly hopeless as well. Good luck...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Arnd Pralle	2.4	0	Physics	101	2	2	2	905620	10/26/06	He is so difficult. he talks to himself and acts very slow. he makes the class so hard. try other professors before cosidering him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjiman Priest	5.0	2	English	201	3	5	4	1462349	4/21/11	One of the best professors I have had! Last year I took his advanced writing class. Class was extremely interesting and thought provoking. Would highly recommend his class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Pritchard	3.2	2	History	161	5	4	2	1639803	11/30/11	Boring lectures for a constant hour and a half. Very easy class if you attend his lectures.. practically no work needed out of the book. Three papers on four different books and three tests is a ton of work but no unbearable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Pritchard	3.2	1	History	161	3	3	3	1639803	11/8/11	Nice, easy to talk to, yet when he lectures, it may be boring and his voice is pretty low, you have to keep asking him to raise his voice if you want to take notes efficiently. There's also way too much work for a 100 lvl class, but if you're willing to work hard, you can manage a B.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Pusatier	3.7	2	Law	130	5	5	4	1146787	5/15/12	Pretty simple and somewhat interesting class. If you attend every lecture you should easily get an A with little to no studying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Pusatier	3.7	2	Law	130	5	5	4	1146787	6/15/08	Really easy class and a very good professor. As long as you don't miss any classes, this is a very, very easy A. The midterm and final both take about 15 minutes and require little-to-no studying. His teaching style is straightforward and simple, but never boring. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Steve Pusatier	3.7	0	Law	130	2	1	3	1146787	6/2/10	I don't not agree with the post above. But, To be honest. This class was really hard. He doesnot use UBLearns, unorganized in teaching. I really studied for his exams and still got a bad grade. I don't think he curves. Well he doesn't even provide a grade scale. His cutoffs from what I got in my exams seems to be really High. BEWARE..!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Warren Quigley	3.2	1	Fine Arts	120	4	2	3	1033971	1/26/12	Overall, a nice teacher, he doesn't give much feedback on projects about how he feels about them unless you specifically ask. If you try on the projects and you are confident about what you've done, you will get a good grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Warren Quigley	3.2	2	Fine Arts	110	4	4	5	1033971	5/4/10	Amazing class just be creative and try on the projects!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Marion Quirici	5.0	2	English	201	4	5	5	1653732	11/29/12	She is very nice, very helpful, and fair person. She knows her topic. No text book is required, no exams, only 5 assignments and they are easy to do If u just attend to her class and follow her instructions. Her class is very interesting, so u will never feel bored. I highly recommend her for everyone. Your English skills will improve a lot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Marion Quirici	5.0	2	English	201	3	5	3	1653732	11/26/12	Very friendly and available. Helps you find a research topic that helps you with your major, and goes out of her way to help you find good critical sources. English isn't my thing, but I loved this class and got good grades.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Rabin	3.3	1	Medicine	0	2	3	1	254206	1/27/07	Basically, he reads from the notes as I recall--which are very terse. I was told early on by a professor on the QT that medical students cant read and absorb from textbooks so we usually get crap prppt slides. This teachers notes were good, but dense. He needs to adjust the level of depth for med students and not bioorganic chemists
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Rabin	3.3	2	Medicine	501	3	4		254206	9/26/03	Decent professor, teaches well but talks excessively. Always willing to help although subject matter can be difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Richard Rabin	3.3	1	Medicine		3	4		254206	9/29/03	watch your back with this guy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stanley Radon	3.8	2	Not Specified	317	5	5	5	1069461	12/22/12	Excellent Professor! Environmental Politics is such a great class! I recommend it to everyone. It really talks about hot button issues that really stimulate your interest. Homework is a little annoying, but you need to hear both sides of an issues before you talk about it in class. Project was easy. I really did not have to do much for this class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stanley Radon	3.8	2	Not Specified	385	5	5	3	1069461	12/7/07	Class was amazing. Great, great great guy. He is funny, keeps things entertaining. A few fun field trips, guest speakers. Stanley encourages students to get involved. NO TEXTBOOK, which is amazing. At the end of the course, students need to do a fifteen minute ppt presentation. Great class, I RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Stanley Radon	3.8	0	Not Specified	385	3	1	3	1069461	12/1/08	He did not give out the right dates for exams and did not give adequate time to prepare. He did not give anyway to contact him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	512	2	5	1	1046138	1/11/12	This was one of the more difficult and time consuming classes I took. Assignments require much more time than you expect, especially considering their weight in the overall grade. Raja however is very willing to help clarify topics both in and out of class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	512	1	5	3	1046138	4/14/10	Amazing teacher, incredibly intelligent and accomplished. Not the easiest material, but very useful in "the real world". I took the mandatory quantitative methods courses, and really wish Food Systems would have been offered during my stint at UB. Learn from her - she's fantastic!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	512	2	3	1	1046138	12/2/08	This class was a headache all semester. Professor Raja is extremely intelligent and very friendly, but her class is terrible. Some assignments were crazy long, like 6-8 hours. Definitely the worst of the required classes in the planning department.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	513	1	3	2	1046138	4/29/08	A much better class than PD512, but Dr. Raja is still the only professor that teaches it. You will complete a mini-plan as your semester project. Her office hours are always in demand due to the volume and difficulty of the course material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	512	1	2	5	1046138	10/31/07	Very focused on own research. Limited office hours, takes ages to answer questions by email. She is highly intelligent and very helpful when you can actually get more than 30 seconds of her time. This course has too great a workload for only 3 credits. TA unhelpful. Very harsh grading. Exams and assignments very difficult. Expect a rough semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	0	Architecture	512	3	1	5	1046138	9/24/10	Methods classes are always problems. But with her learning is not going to happen. They have replaced her in the methods area, tenured. Knows it all, or thinks she does, a research money graber for the school, but far from even a good teacher. STAY AWAY. She is smart, so smart she dislikes talking to students. A hard grader, outside methods even.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	512	1	5	2	1046138	12/20/08	Difficult course material. Helpful instructor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	2	Architecture	513	5	5	5	1046138	9/20/08	She is extremely motivating and the best professor I have come across
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Samina Raja	3.5	0	Architecture	212	1	1	1	1046138	3/14/08	Didn't learn anything, but how to look elsewhere for classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tom Ralabate	4.3	2	Theater		4	5	5	156414	9/4/05	Mr. Tom is one of the most inspirational teachers you'll ever get. He is also awesome to have on your resume!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tom Ralabate	4.3	0	Theater		3	1		156414	11/12/03	great teacher - if you are one of his pets
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tom Ralabate	4.3	2	Theater		2	5		156414	3/3/03	One of the best teachers I coudl ever ask for.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tom Ralabate	4.3	2	Theater		1	5		156414	2/22/04	great guy, and a pleasure to work with. always ready to communicate with anyone in the dept. not just the dancers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Tom Ralabate	4.3	2	Theater		1	5		156414	3/31/03	Tom is a kind person, and an amazing techer, something that is hard to find here in the department of theater and dance.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	1	Mathematics	241	3	3	3	338649	4/1/13	I'm not a huge fan of him because he consistently lets class out 10 minutes early. This lets him skip material that is necessary for homework that you have to learn on your own. He's honestly just average at teaching.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	425	3	4	4	338649	5/3/12	Genuinely cares about students understanding material. It's a little tough to tell what is important, though, since his derivations are very involved. Homework is a MUST to do well on tests. Gives partial credit, but curve is very small. Offers one make-up test at end of semester.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	5	5	338649	3/24/11	Such a good math professor, definitely take him for as many classes as you can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	3	338649	5/5/10	Great professor, friendly when you dont ask dumb questions. good syllabus(4 tests, quizes once a week), gives very helpful reviews before the test. if you put in the effort to go over and over and OVER the practice exams you'll do great on the exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	0	Mathematics	141	2	1	1	338649	4/29/10	He's pretty much the worst math professor you'll ever have. He's rude and not helpful. His tests are based off reviews he gives a few days before the test. Not a nice guy. You'll learn more by attending your recitations than you will from attending his lectures. Looks like he was in the mafia or something. DO NOT RECOMMEND!Don't take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	3	338649	12/13/09	an okay professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	5	3	338649	4/24/09	He looks and sounds like he'll beat you senseless if you get something wrong but when you sit down with him one on one he's actually a really nice guy and a great professor. If you understand what you did wrong on tests he'll often give points back. Really easy grader. Great class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	5	5	5	338649	11/20/08	Best professor ever! He will give you all the problems before each quiz, exam. No final, no surprise problems--wt else are you expecting? Super easy A!!! And he's a very nice person, really good at teaching!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	4	5	2	338649	12/13/07	Is intimidating in class but very nice and helpful out of class, will gladly help you with any math issues you have. Test grading is done infront of you at office meetings, so you might get embarrased if you do badly on a test. quizzes during recitation are easy and so are test, all you need to do is know the homework problems.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	4	3	338649	10/7/07	EASY grader and gives review sheets word for word whats on the test
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	4	4	338649	3/27/13	Ramachandran is very intimidating in class, but a really nice guy in office hours. The class itself is pretty easy. The material uses equations that you have to memorize. The only grades are weekly quizzes and 3 exams. You have to go to office hours to get your exams, and he grades them right in front of you, so you can sort of explain yourself
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	5	5	5	338649	12/7/11	When you first meet him, he is very intimidating. However, if you do your work he learns who you are and is very helpful. He grades the your exams in front of you. So if you do things wrong you can explain what you were trying and get points back. Tests are based off of review sheets. Hw is not collected and quiz questions are given before the quiz
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	4	4	4	338649	12/8/10	At first I thought he was the worst professor ever; taught very fast, unclear, and didn't seem eager to answer questions. Once the semester went on though it was clear he really is a great professor, you just have to put some work in yourself. Very friendly and helpful when talking one on one. He just doesn't like dumb questions during class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	0	Mathematics	141	2	2	1	338649	4/29/10	Potential 141 students, DO YOU. Took this class, BIG MISTAKE. His lecture seems like he's reviewing the material for himself rather than teaching. If you're extremely good at math, class will not be a problem. If you struggle, find a better professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	5	4	3	338649	4/21/10	I would highly suggest this professor for Calculus 141. He goes over everything in class. The homework he assigns is optional but really helpful if you do it. He gives out example problems for all four tests and the once a week quizzes which are usually exactly the same.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	3	5	5	338649	12/8/09	He is a nice guy =) He teaches you fundamental principles, and you improve your mathmatical thinking based on classes. It is a great oppurtunity to meet him to study mth 141.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	141	5	5	3	338649	2/4/09	He gives you quiz problems and exam questions ahead of time. He explains the material clearly. There is no final. He makes you come to his office to pick up exams so that he can go over them with you. No graded homework. If you put in SOME effort, the class is a breeze. As breezy as calculus can be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	5	5	5	338649	9/26/08	he is a very nice person and very helpul and teaches each and everything in detail must suggest everyone to take his class only
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	0	Mathematics	141	4	2	2	338649	11/11/07	hes scary but hes an easy grader and u gotta get him to kno ur face and he gets really mad if u leave in the middle of class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	5	5	3	338649	1/18/07	Listen, you're gonna walk into the class and be completely intimitated at this tall angry man, but give it time and you'll find he is the easiest grader in the world and a pretty nice and genuine person. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STUDY THE REVIEW SHEETS HE GIVES BEFORE THE EXAM! He uses the exact numbers used from the reviewon the exams and everything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	4	1	338649	12/13/06	He brings out the old tude in class but he's an easy grader. Grading of exams is much like being lined up for execution--one on one during office hours. Quizzes in recitation are easy, exams are easy because his review sheets cover the problems that will be tested.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics		1	4	2	338649	10/29/06	He is very grumpy in class but nice in person. He grades very fair. If you do your homework and practise problems, this class will be no problem at all. I would recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	4	2	338649	11/5/04	Easy grader, very personable and nice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	0	Mathematics	142	1	1		338649	4/16/04	difficult professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	2	Mathematics	241	4	5	3	338649	11/1/06	The tests are easy and the homework isn't graded and the answers to the quizes are gone over before the quiz. After the first few tests he makes you come to his office to get your grade and personally goes over it with you, and he is a very easy grader. Overall i think he is a very cool guy, would reccomend him to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	1	Mathematics	142	3	3	4	338649	12/14/05	Pretty tough material, and he goes through it fast but for every test/quiz, will give you a list of practice problems. The ones on the test/quizz are either exactly, or very similair to the practice problems. Drops the 2 lowest quiz grades, and has no final!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mohan Ramachandran	3.7	0	Mathematics	142	1	1		338649	5/15/04	DONT take if you dont have to.. T'isnt it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vinay Ramani	3.3	1	Economics	182	3	3	2	1010051	11/14/07	hard to understand; can't explain things clearly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vinay Ramani	3.3	2	Economics	182	5	5	5	1010051	8/27/07	Great teacher, extremely clear. VERY helpful. always willing to clarify and very approachable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Vinay Ramani	3.3	1	Economics	182	4	3	3	1010051	8/28/07	This professor is OK. He has an accent and is therefore hard to understand at times. His notes are all powerpoint which makes it easy to follow and understand. His voice, however, is monotone and i fell asleep the first day.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jillian Pugliese	5.0	2	Linguistics	207	5	5	5	1717665	5/2/12	Jillian is an awesome instructor! She's really funny, and since she's young, she can really connect better with her students. She's very helpful. Definitely recommend taking any class she's teaching!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jillian Pugliese	5.0	2	Linguistics	200	2	5	2	1717665	5/1/12	Jillian is a great teacher. The class is difficult but she's a really nice person and is willing to help you out if you ever need it. Jillian is young, down to earth, and pretty funny even if you don't care about the material. Any guy would be lucky to have her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Zhen QI	4.7	2	Management	401	4	5	2	1685304	12/10/12	She is awesome has a great way of teaching
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Zhen QI	4.7	2	Management	306	3	5	4	1685304	3/27/12	She is a great professor and really tries to teach us things that finance major students will actually encounter in the future. You have to read the textbook to understand the material!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Zhen QI	4.7	2	Management	306	4	4	4	1685304	5/12/12	Professor Qi is amazing! She uses current events to make the class more interesting and to show the real world applications of financial accounting. The course has a project where you conduct analysis of a public company. The project is fun, relevant and educational.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	360	4	5	5	951315	5/2/12	This is my third class with Jack, and he has yet to disappoint me. He's very knowledgeable and makes each of his 3 classes distinct. It's a shame he's retiring, as it's clear that he cares a lot for his students. He's even willing to help with projects for other classes. A prior understanding of architectural terminology is recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	391	3	5	5	951315	4/16/10	I loved this class. The material is pretty easy if you already know some architectural terms - then it's just a matter of applying them to the right structures. He's a great professor, and I'd definitely recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	386	4	3	4	951315	2/24/09	Damn you quinan! Give me that A! The man does know everything. Fun Fact: his prep school he went to has an endowment twice that of UB... Overall: good class, usually enjoyable. Not that easy unless you want to try.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	390	1	5	5	951315	11/29/07	Be sure to attend class and take carfeul notes. He mostly tests on what he lectures on. Great and caring man! If you like architecture, you will love his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	348	4	5	5	951315	1/23/07	Love this guy, def my favorite teacher at UB! He's very spunky and funny, kindof awkward but in a good way. Really interesting classes and he's exremely passionate about Architecture, he knows EVERYTHING. Pretty hard so def read the books/articles he assigns and study for tests. Great Professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	1	Art History	386	1	3	4	951315	1/9/11	Not very concise in his lectures. Extremely difficult to pick out what's important. Once complained to the class "this is an academic discipline." That may be so, but he is teaching at a working class school, not the ivy league, and most of us are taking at least four other classes. He's nice but also tough considering the workload.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	360	2	5	3	951315	3/31/10	well, having one of the top experts on Frank Lloyd Wright in the country as a teacher has its perks, you know he has to be a great teacher when ub stole him from an ivy league school by making him head curator of the Darwin martin house, He is a great teacher, as long as you show up to class and pay attention you should be able to get an B easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	386	1	4	2	951315	12/15/08	hard! def dont take for just an art credit you really have to be interested in architecture. if youre not, good luck. hes a cute nice older man, he really does know everything, its kinda sick
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John (jack) Quinan	4.6	2	Art History	390	4	5	1	951315	6/7/07	Not too bad overall. Speaks clear english. Somewhat boring. He can be amusing. Mandatory attendance with surprise quizzes. Easy workload. Probably a 3 out of 5 overall.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	3	4	5	724170	4/10/13	Great teacher! Highly recommend her for anyone taking psy101. She speaks very clearly and almost anyone can follow along in lecture. The 4 exams are the only grades for the class and are a little tough but read the book and youll do fine. she also gives extra credit!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	4	5	4	724170	3/13/13	She was a really great professor. She explained things really well. She was funny and really held your attention. Great speaker and awesome class. Just study for the tests, take good notes and go to class and you'll do fine. :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	348	2	5	5	724170	12/15/12	Wonderful wonderful wonderful! Truly wonderful, hands down! She's like a breath of fresh air amidst a toxic sea of professors here at UB. She makes you think, she makes you laugh, and if you're not crazy she makes you fall in love with the subject too! :D
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	4	724170	9/10/12	She runs a fast-paced lecture that nearly anyone can keep up with. She explains things in words we can understand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	2	5	2	724170	5/10/12	Wendy Quinton is an awesome professor! She explains everything really well, and her lectures are actually really enjoyable. She's very funny, and uses real life examples in her lectures. I learned so much from PSY 250, and I don't think I could have a higher opinion of her. She is great!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	421	4	4	4	724170	1/8/12	Professor is wonderful. She left due to illness, which really affected my interest in the class. It is often hard for me to pay attention to lectures, but I was always attentive in her classes. She is very clear and focused when she teaches, and everything makes sense. If you are one who has a hard time concentrating, she's your professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	1	Psychology	421	1	3	3	724170	5/21/11	i took a few of her classes. overall, she's is a nice professor, and actually cares about her students, but she is not generous with the grades. you really gotta work hard if you want to get good grades
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	3	5	5	724170	1/17/11	She is really a great teacher and made the lectures very interesting. The tests however got a little tricky and a lot of the questions are from the book. Theres a lot of material to cover so just study it, otherwise there is no homework or outside work other than the experiment requirements
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	4	5	4	724170	12/29/10	The class was easy if you went to lecture and read the book. I am so upset the whole course I thought I was going to get an A, but got an A-. I was less then half a point away from an A, but still got the A-. Im still so upset.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	4	5	4	724170	11/27/10	Great lecturer. Really engaging and can get you to pay attention very easily. Makes psychology very interesting and fun to learn. Plus, I think she's bit of a fox ;]
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	3	5	4	724170	4/2/13	I took professor Quinton's class last semester. You have to study to get an A. She is very clear with everything. Just make sure you write down everything she says in class. It's bound to show up in the exams. Textbook is compulsory too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	3	4	5	724170	1/31/13	Dr. Quinton was an excellent professor. Lectures were fun to go to and the notes were easy to take. *Read the book* and study and you'll do fine on the 4 tests that decide your grade.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	5	5	5	724170	6/14/12	She is so beautiful! She's hot, smart, funny, energetic, interesting, and a joy to talk to. I want her sooo bad!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	5	5	4	724170	4/6/12	AMAZING shes hysterical! On her tests the questions are worth a lot each but the extra credits right before each test... really helpful. Go to class youll understand everything if you attend. and skim through the book before tests the terms she doesnt go over but are in there are "fair game" and her in class exercises are helpful too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	4	4	4	724170	11/3/11	Best professor! Made class interesting and taught in a way that made the concepts easy to remember. Go to class and study her notes and you'll do fine. I never bought the book or read and got an A and a 100% on the cumulative final.. so the text definitely isn't necessary
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	5	5	3	724170	5/1/11	3 classes with her and yet again never fails to keep it interesting even for a wretched dry topic like research methods.

She made psych 101 every bit of fun that I would expect a psych class to be. Just to put things in context I'm a Math major and I still found the class to be a lot of fun. Just read the text once and read her notes thoroughly and you should be fine. It's definitely an A course.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	3	5	2	724170	11/7/09	Great class. She takes what would be a totally boring subject and makes it interesting. It's easy to remember because she incorporates a lot of real world stuff in to the material when lecturing and she's kind of funny. Doing the assigned reading and showing up to class is really important though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	4	5	4	724170	4/29/09	Awesome professor. Was fun and quirky and made lectures interesting. Doesn't ever overload you with information and makes topic you would think would be boring fun! If you have a change take any class with her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	1	Psychology	250	3	3	3	724170	5/18/08	Class is okay. Alot of notes at times, but I found it easier to learn if you went to class. The tests are all worth 25% so your grade is only based on that :/
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	4	724170	11/29/07	very good

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	0	Psychology	250	1	2	2	724170	12/27/09	Took this class, and it was HARD! I put in alot of effort and it didnt pay off in the end.Extra Credit is too long and takes time to complete, and with that, you may not even get credit for it. That blows!! Exams are difficult. Ended up with a C-, and she wouldnt help with 2% to get a C, so I wouldnt have to take it over. Sigh!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	3	4	2	724170	11/10/09	Awesome Professor. Take any class with her. She knows what she is talking about and presents material in a very clear and fun way. Who wants to learn about research methods? But she makes the class fun and entertaining. Awesome Prof., you do need to attend class for notes and need to study. But she is so sweet.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	421	2	4	3	724170	7/11/09	Although the class was very interesting and sometimes fun, there is a lot to cover. Too many psychologists to remember plus their contributions. She won't curve your final grade. And exams are cumulative. Just prepare yourself to read a lot. Her extra credit work are only worth 1% of your final grade. Oh yea, and shes from Cali, big deal!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	250	4	5	4	724170	5/16/07	Very clear in what she's telling us, you almost feel like a 6-year-old with how many times she repeats herself, but it works. Her tests are harder than you'd expect but an A is still very possible. Nice lady.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Wendy Quinton	4.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	3	724170	12/20/05	Best teacher yet! Kept you interested in the lecture. Syllabus is explained nice.

There are very short reading assignments from a little book of essays. Essays are not too bad. She's easy to talk to and she understands that it's an English 101 class not a English 450 class. 2 Essays (3-5 Pg.) 1 Research Paper (6-10Pg.) Improved my Writing capabilities!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	0	History	348	1	1	1	741414	12/13/12	It was terrible, unclear boring and dumb. I didnt learn anything and still got a bad grade. Dont take this class people!!!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	539	5	5	5	741414	5/22/12	Dr. Radford is a very nice professor who is more than willing to help her students outside of class. She assigns a very manageable amount of reading (along with short summaries of the weekly reading), a short paper, and longer final paper. She also values when students engage with one another and allows class discussion to exhaust itself.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	449	4	5	5	741414	5/4/10	Dr. Radford is one of the best professors I have had at UB. She is extremely helpful and genuinely wants her students to succeed. She is very flexible in terms of work and due dates. She is also very knowledgeable. Talking history with her at her office is one of my best memory at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	5	4	741414	3/30/10	Gail is such a great teacher! Her TA's are great as well. She provides you with an outline to copy at the beginning of class and then she lectures. She can get a little boring, but her tests are easy. Take HIS162 with her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	5	5	741414	10/7/09	She is a very sweet and nice lady and cares for her students. Her class isnt hard, you just have to right an essay every week which is grade either check minus check and check plus (very easy to get a +) Her tests are very fair and easy, she drops the lower of the two tests. She is a great teacher and I recommend her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	4	5	741414	8/12/08	Probably the most Liberal teacher I have ever met. Sure, she's good, but she hates American values and I think is a closet Communist... so you know what you're getting in to.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	5	5	741414	4/8/08	She was a good teacher, except SUPER LIBERAL. She teaches more off of Liberal talking points, but her class was easy. So if you are moderate or conservative, you might not like her that much.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	386	4	5	4	741414	3/3/08	Professor Radford is so great! She is such a nice and understanding lady! She's like your cool aunt...or something. Her tests are fairly easy and weekly reading questions help you to keep on top of the readings. Wonderful and understanding woman!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	4	4	741414	4/11/07	Very good professor. Easy to understand and keeps classes interesting. 2 midterms (lower one is dropped) which are pretty easy. 8 weekly papers but those are pretty easy to get a good grade on. nice lady too def recomend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	4	4	741414	12/20/05	Lectures are a little bit slow, but she is interested her material so it helps. Easy tests and assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	3	3	741414	11/9/12	Her lectures were quite boring at times. There were weekly journal assignments and a final paper on a book. Her exams were 50 multiple choice questions and they were super easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	502	4	5	4	741414	11/17/11	Dr. Radford is very bright and passionate about her job. She may be very vocal about her opinions especially politically but is usually respectful of differing opinion and genuinely seems to enjoy debating for knowledge sake not just for winnings sake (a marked difference from some professors.)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	386	5	5	4	741414	4/13/10	Dr. Radford is one of the best professors at UB in my opinion. Her 300 level class requires some reading but what class doesn't. As long as you do the reading notes and show up you'll do well
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	5	4	741414	12/4/09	Easy class. She is a great teacher. Her exams are reasonable and all you really need to remember are the terms. If you stayed up late or have a hangover, just copy the outline at the beginning of class then take a nap. You can always ask the TA about the lecture or read the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	3	2	741414	12/20/08	like some others said she's pretty far on the left wing. even a little too much for me. sure she opposes the war and bush but i think she goes over the line. nice lady but i think that republicans wouldn't like her.easy tests, except you write 10 papers graded by the t.a which sucks.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	630	4	5	5	741414	4/25/08	Dr. Radford always goes the extra mile for her students. She genuinely cares about them, and it showed in the research seminar. We had to write a 20 page research paper, and she took everyone step-by-step through the process. She made easy what other professors bungle and inevitably confuse students in: primary source research/analysis. Good stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	386	3	5	1	741414	4/6/08	Wonderful teacher,seriously one of the nicest teachers I have ever had. Her class is not boring, the readings are the most manageable out of any professor I have taken yet. She's super understanding, and grading she's reasonable at the very worst. I wish she was teaching a class next semester. She is also knowledgeable about the subject!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	4	4	741414	12/11/07	Weekly papers but only a page long. Very easy multiple choice tests that come directly from the study terms. Lecture is absolutely useless. Easy A-B.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	491	4	5	3	741414	4/10/07	Dr. Radford's class on the 20's and 30's US is great. Her focus is on getting you into primary source documents, so if you are afraid of getting your hands dirty and spending some quality time in the Congressional record, this may not be the class for you. Small weekly assignments, and various assignments leading up to a final 10-15 page paper.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	4	4	741414	11/29/05	A nice lady, if not a little to liberal for my tastes. She likes Michael Moore, if that is any indications. Lectures are fairly dry, not enough to put you to sleep though. Easy tests, the only bad part about her classes (and she does it in all of them) is that she makes you write weekly essay assignments, which can be kind of annoying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	5	5	4	741414	11/12/05	Such a nice lady, she reminds me of a high school teacher, she teaches everything straight and simple, it's a pleasure to go to her class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Gail Radford	4.5	2	History	162	4	5	1	741414	10/30/05	soft spoken and a delight to listen to!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	207	4	4	3	1663168	11/6/12	Pretty easy class. The speaking in class is very conversational and not difficult. Writing is short and is things like movie reviews. Definitely a good introductory class, people of all levels in my class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	152	5	5	4	1663168	8/22/12	Michael is so great. Spanish has always been difficult for me but Michael made it so easy to understand. He is the easiest grader in the language department. I can't wait to take 207/208 with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	208	5	5	4	1663168	4/4/12	i can't believe no one rated him as hot!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	152	5	5	2	1663168	10/8/12	Michael is the best professor I have ever had! He explains grammar very well and encourages students to ask questions. Class was never boring. He will prepare you for his in class quizzes and are the basically the exact same thing as he went over in class. Easy grader. The test are made by the department but he will prepare you well. Take him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	208	5	5	3	1663168	5/10/12	Michael was one of my favorite professors this semester. His class is really easy, and his exams for 208 are essay exams in class so you really don't have to study at all. Besides those, you'll have 2 presentations and a debate, and that's about it. Its a very easy course. If you have a choice for 208, take Michael's class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Raguso	4.7	2	Languages	152	5	5	4	1663168	4/3/12	Best Spanish teacher I've had at UB! Tests are made by the department, but are easy because he makes sure you know the material. Easy grader, great teacher! Very easy to talk to also!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miroslav Rakic	4.5	2	Mathematics	131	5	4	5	1023346	4/8/08	if its ur first time doing calculus, he's going to be a problem. he has 5 tests, lowest is dropped. no offica hours but u can email him. he's pretty clear with what a teachs but he goes lightning fast. its a fast paced course so be prepared
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miroslav Rakic	4.5	2	Mathematics	115	4	4	4	1023346	8/28/07	Easygoing guy, straight-foreward. He says english is not his first language but he is crystal clear. Makes math easy. + hes really cute!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	1	Physics	301	1	3	4	248092	1/19/10	I got an A although I didn't deserve it. I copied from my friend all of the homeworks and exams and he got a B-. I think Ram didn't like his yankees hat coz hes a mets fan. He kept cracking jokes about it. also he would write some crazy stuff on the board and then ask y we looked sad. Has hearing problems so you have to be laud
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	1	Physics	301	1	1	4	248092	12/5/06	Professor Ram is a good professor to take if you want to learn mechanics well. However, if you want to have a decent GPA you may as well forget about taking this course unless you're a physics major and have to (the department knows about him and won't do anything - join the battle guys). If he had a grader this class would be decent.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	0	Physics	301	1	1	4	248092	9/12/06	I don't know where to start- his classes are boring, he teaches so dryly, the homework is strangely graded- i had the solutions manual and he still marked it wrong cause I didn't do it the way he wanted it; grading is arbitrary- gives special curves to those who come and visit him and laugh at his corny jokes; avoid him, unless you like Fs!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	0	Physics	301	3	1	4	248092	12/20/05	Wouldn't grade the last 2 homeworks, said the whole class did a problem wrong because we didn't prove it the way he wanted.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	2	Physics		4	3		248092	5/10/04	I got an A in his class and I am terrible at Physics. His tests were very appropriate in that if you did the homeworks the tests were a breeze. I recommend him to anyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	2	Physics	101	4	5		248092	11/3/03	He's very amusing but I'm not quite sure if I'm learning anything. Watch out for that second test, it's a b*tch
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	2	Physics	100	5	4	5	248092	4/11/08	Dr. Ram is a good teacher for newcomers to physics such as myself. He clearly loves the subject and genuinely wants us to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	0	Physics	301	2	1	4	248092	10/6/06	Avoid at all costs. If you look to him for help, expect a few insults and to repeat yourself about 5 times before he understands anything you tell him. No partial credit given. It is obvious the guy is just really, really old and is on a power trip; he should really be in Florida wearing white shoes and driving a huge car, not teaching physics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	0	Physics	301302	2	1	4	248092	3/12/06	one of the two worst in the department. material isnt very hard, but hes senile. dont expect a fair test, or ANY partial credit. assigns your grade by throwing darts blindly at a board. do yourself a favor, wait another year until he (hopefully) retires
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	0	Physics	301	3	1	4	248092	10/7/04	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Ram	2.5	1	Physics	1012	3	3		248092	3/9/04	he's kind of hard to understand at times but he is the cutest and funniest old guy. his notes don't help to much so make sure you read the book too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	111	4	3	2	110340	4/9/13	She is a nice professor, she chose to drop one of our exam because everyone in the class had low grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	113	2	1	2	110340	3/25/13	This teacher is really not good at all. She doesn't teach anything. She just talks. Its either you understand it or don't. Even the labs the TA just tells me what code to copy and I get a 100. Not complaining about that but when it comes to tests, I know nothing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	321	5	5	4	110340	1/7/13	Very easy class if you are a decent C programmer. Class material was a little too shallow for me; I would have liked to have learned a little more. Projects are slightly challenging, but doable. TAs are usually very good, and Dr. Bina gives a lot of help if you go to her office hours. No homework, 3 projects, 1 midterm, and the final.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	114	5	5	2	110340	12/3/12	She gives easy assignments and her quizzes are very straight forward. She is very understanding and will help you out whenever she can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	241	5	5	4	110340	10/24/12	Dr. Bina is a very helpful professor. She does make some mistakes in class, which can cause confusion. Her project description are vague and confusing, but if you talk to her, she usually explains things sufficiently. Tests are easy if you go to lecture and give at least 50% of your attention. TAs are usually pretty good as well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	489	5	1	2	110340	8/24/11	Avoid if you actually want to learn anything. Her "lectures" consist of strings of buzz words and broken english alongside slides filled with meaningless diagrams. Her projects are a joke but her expectations are extremely vague as are her test questions. An easy grader but in the end I came out of the class with nothing to show for it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	241	5	5	3	110340	3/30/10	Easy Class and she makes it easier. Assigns weekly homeworks and can be a challenge but once you get your grade you can talk to the ta and he will change it if you can kinda show you know what your doing. Tests are very easy if you go to class. she tells you exactly what to study
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	421	3	3	4	110340	10/21/09	Dont need to go to class but she is a decent teacher sometimes hard to understand but never that bad. projects are not to hard and good to learn from its a good class to take with her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	521	5	5	4	110340	12/21/08	Bina is a great professor and very helpful outside of class as well. She's hilarious in-class and makes the information much more fun. She practically hands you the exam questions ahead of time, and projects are lots of fun (as long as you know C ahead of time or can learn very fast). Definitely take with her!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	230	4	3	3	110340	3/11/06	There isn't a choice for this class, but I'll tell you about here anyway. I alreaddy knew C++, so for me everything was a joke. Even if I didn't know it, I still think it would be a joke. She has no idea how to run an exam, have fun finding you ID when you are done. Uses terrible annalogies, I think we baked about ten cakes. You'll get that soon.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	111	2	2	1	110340	3/28/13	It is very difficult to follow her lectures as she tends to babble and/or talk in circles. All of the labs are very easy to figure out by yourself (most of the TAs will actually just give you the necessary codes), but retaining and understanding information for exams is incredibly difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	321	2	1	1	110340	1/15/13	worst professor I ever had! She doesn't know how to teach
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	113	5	4	1	110340	12/12/12	You don't need to attend her class everyday, but you must go to her review session, she will explain all the questions that are 98% similar to the test/final. You just need to know all the key terms on the last page of every Chapter. Her labs are super easy, you can always get 100, the lab TA is really helpful. Overall, her class is super easy =)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	341	4	4	3	110340	10/24/12	This class was average. The projects were vague and did not always follow the progression of the class material. We ended up having only 2 homework assignments, even though they were supposed to be weekly. Tests are fairly easy if you go to class and pay attention. If you can, I would pick Schindler, but Dr. Bina did a pretty good job.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	241	4	3	3	110340	5/17/12	Lectures are really helpful to attend, though she is a bit incomprehensible with an accent. But go to class and she will tell you exactly what's on the tests and go over examples really similar to actual test questions. Overall a fair class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	421	2	2	5	110340	1/20/11	A babbling incoherent mess. It's as if she... when she... doesn't know english... talks in sentence fragments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	421	4	5	4	110340	1/21/10	You learn and get a good grade. Exams are such that you know what to expect and she always throws in a little twist to challenge you. Plus, she's very nice to students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	421	4	4	3	110340	4/30/09	The lectures are tough to get much from, she is a bit scattered. But, she goes over examples which are basically the exam, so as long as you do those, your golden. The projects are not too bad if you can use C.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	230	4	4	2	110340	11/30/06	Pretty easy class if you get the concepts of programming. The labs go from easy to hard relativly fast. But if you attend lecture (which most dont) she gives you some lab answers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	230	5	2	5	110340	5/16/05	The most scattered professor I've ever experienced, her lectures are incomprehensible. Thankfully, the labs are simple as hell, the tests are a joke, and it's almost impossible to not do well in this course. She drops the lowest lab grade and lets you cheat on the final exam. I mean, come on! I had no prior programming experience and it was easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	230	4	3	4	110340	5/8/05	Fun class, teaches pretty good. Claims to be most available professor at UB but definitely isn't. A fairly easy A if you pay attention and do the labs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	230	3	5	3	110340	11/18/04	She is very nice and easy to talk to. I didnt like the way she presented the material. So far i have almost no idea whats going on, but somehow have a 75, i am hoping to drift bye. She does make an effort to provide help to you. The accent is tehre, but easy to understand,
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	421	3	5		110340	6/19/03	The course is difficult but she does all she can to help. You can always meet her, but sometimes have to wait in line. If you put the time in she will too. You have to work with her not just take from her. I really like her as a teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	114	1	1		110340	6/4/03	Not qualified to impart knowledge to others, rare office hours, projects impossible to understand or complete, makes otherwise bright students give up. This class is really a crosslisted 500 level graduate course, its hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	421	3	4		110340	4/14/03	Gives decent discussions, fairly reasonable projects, a LOT of people sign up for office hours but she is reasonably helpful. Definitely one of the better teachers in the department.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	116	2	1		110340	2/19/03	Impossible to understand. Pointless mumbling lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	114	3	5		110340	2/17/03	Always helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	116	3	5		110340	1/24/03	great prof, had her for 2 classes. hard, but is there to help the students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	421	3	4	4	110340	1/5/05	kind of disorganized, not a bad prof though. annoying projects - noone really understands em, code is presented in recitation to copy down. you dont have a choice anyway, so go register for 421 now

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	2	Computer Science	116	3	5		110340	4/3/03	Helpful, knowledgable, concise. The tests aren't too hard, and she's very fair in her grading.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	0	Computer Science	114	4	2		110340	2/18/03	very hard to understand her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Bina Ramamurthy	2.9	1	Computer Science	116	3	4		110340	2/17/03	Hard to understand at time. She helpful during office hours!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin  Ramm	2.8	1	English	102	3	2	1	1764200	11/15/12	Hes boring, the assignments are okay but aren't very interesting. You dont learn anything in the class you just write stuff. He's a nice guy but just isn't the best teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin  Ramm	2.8	0	English	102	2	1	1	1764200	11/15/12	Mr Ramm is extremely boring and awkward. He'll ask a question and sit there for 3 minutes staring at everyone. Really really dumb and boring assignments, not a very smart guy, mis-spells words on the board. Bad grader, class is extremely boring and hard to stay awake. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin  Ramm	2.8	2	English	101	4	5	3	1764200	11/15/12	I am getting a A in this class, Yes, Ramm is a little awkward and just sits there for a while waiting for kids to answer his question, but that is just because no one participates. Aside from that, I think he is a reasonable grader, gives good feedback on your papers, and if you actually revise according to his comments you'll get a good grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	2	5	5	237620	8/24/06	textbook was not needed -- I wasted $80 Lots of work but I did like the class alot -- instructor had a sarcastic humor that was funny ... the slackers did not like him because he pushed their buttons and called them out.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	2	5	5	237620	5/8/05	Always helpful Great person to bounce ideas off - he likes to talk about new businesses and new ideas
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	4	5	5	237620	4/5/05	Very cool guy. He challenges students but is very helpful along the way if you ask for assistance. Probably best professor that teaches the course

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	2	5	4	237620	7/29/06	Seriously, the amount of work is rediculous. The coursework itself is not hard, but he makes it 10x's more difficult than it really is. He'll do things to get a reaction out of students, which I just found ignorant. If you get a bad group, you're screwed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	3	5	5	237620	2/22/06	Thus guy is on SPEED or something. Helpful, will meet with groups anytime - even 11pm at night! His favorite saying "Sleep is optional" ... Glad I' taking it with him - I might learn something ;)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	3	5	5	237620	7/3/05	don't take this class in the summer -- the workload is heavy -- the prof is good and knows his stuff -- his cases/readings make the class interesting and fun -- make sure that you get a good group because most of the work is group work -- start early --
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	3	5	5	237620	5/6/05	Clear and understandable Lots of material to read but relevant Tough but fair testing Talks way to FAST for 8am Always makes time for students - we met him on Sunday night in the library at 10pm. First time that I ever had a professor do that
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ebrahim Randeree	4.9	2	Business	403	2	5	3	237620	11/21/04	Lots of information - uses current materials and news stories

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	4	5	5	622917	8/2/11	Lecture is useful, Lab is not. His TA barely spoke English, and we had to keep correcting him throughout the year. It's mandatory to attend the lab, but not the lecture. Prof. Rapaport is an amazing teacher. Pay attention, do the homework that's due every week, and you'll do great in the class. He's great, it's fun, and you'll learn a lot too!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	2	5	4	622917	11/2/09	Professor that really goes the extra mile. No PowerPoint presentations, just good ole in class examples and plenty of support makes this professor one of the best for such a difficult subject.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	3	5	2	622917	5/19/09	Google him and you'll see his long list of accomplishments from donating half a million to I Love Lucy stuff to writing NUMEROUS papers. Despite being a genius, he is an amazing teacher and will individually go over the test with you if you go to his office hours and acts like its very important that you feel that you got the right grade.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	484	4	4	5	622917	5/7/07	one of the best teacher UB has...mind-blowing knowledge-makes the class interesting!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	111	4	5	4	622917	9/4/05	good teacher for non-majors... i have an it degree and know 4 comp languages, and i found that he didn't completely bore me... tests are fair for those paying attention. good choice in a teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	563	4	3	1	622917	8/30/05	This guy will bore the living daylights out of you. Pedantic, pedagogical robot.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	484	3	5	5	622917	5/18/10	Rapaport is the coolest! Don't take this specific course if you can't stand reading... We don't read much of the textbook, but there are so many documents that are required. Still, really interesting, and if you do your work, not too hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	2	5	3	622917	10/30/09	Great at everything he does. Amazing restaurant and study restaurant guide. One of the best teachers and smartest people I ever met. His class may not necessarily be easy, but for the amount of effort you put in you will learn a lot. One of the most accomplished men I ever met. Google his name for lists of his accomplishments. Take his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	4	4	4	622917	4/27/09	Tests are pretty easy. Recitation attendance is mandatory which was annoying. Lectures were clear, precise, and not mandatory. Basically if you do the homework, and either read the book or go to class and pay attention then you will get a B. Also, no curves :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	191	4	4	3	622917	6/5/08	Good teacher if you go to class youll do fine got a B did nothing but go to lecture and pay attention. you will hate it while your taking the class but i def would recommend
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	111	5	5	5	622917	9/5/05	GOOD TEACHER. CLASS WAS EASY. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THAT KAREL THE ROBOT PROGRAM.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	462	1	5	4	622917	8/31/05	I took graduate level AI (Now Symbolic AI) with him. Prof. Rappaport was thorough and clear. He gave copious assignments. However, none of the assignments were extraneous.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	William Rapaport	4.6	2	Computer Science	463	3	5	4	622917	5/19/05	By far the best CSE prof I have taken at UB. Extremely clear and detailed explanation of material. Tests are easy if you have any idea of what you are doing. HW are short and fairly easy. Text/readings are confusing sometimes... use as a supplement to class notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Violetta Ravagnoli	4.4	2	History	495	5	5	3	1540237	5/3/12	Had her for Chinese Migrations course. She was very lenient with grades and overall great person. Her italian accent and her looks will have you not wanting to skip class as much.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Violetta Ravagnoli	4.4	2	History	101	4	5	5	1540237	1/5/12	very nice teacher. very helpful. hard on big time...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Violetta Ravagnoli	4.4	1	History	395	3	3	4	1540237	2/11/11	Nice teacher and is very knowledgeable on the subject she is teaching. Great Italian accent.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Violetta Ravagnoli	4.4	2	History	101	3	5	4	1540237	3/6/12	Violetta is great teacher! She cares about her students and strives to make class interesting. She gives fair tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Violetta Ravagnoli	4.4	2	History	111	4	5	5	1540237	11/28/11	Violetta was my favorite TA. She is so helpful and easily the only reason I was able to maintain a good grade in World Civ. I am thankful she was my recitation leader and recommend her to anyone interested.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	5	4	5	224390	4/5/12	Easy topics in class to know. He knows what he's talking about, but drags on about it. He is a very interesting individual. Yes class is at 8am, mandatory and he grades on how much you write, but if you have no issue writing, definitely take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	404	5	4	4	224390	5/11/11	Easy A! He is really boring,like many said his test are essay's and he just counts how many pages you did and gives you a grade, the more pages you do the higher grade, even if you start repeating your self lol.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	438	1	1	4	224390	4/5/11	What could be an interesting subject is reduced to a completely useless class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	342	2	1	4	224390	4/5/11	Terrible, terrible, terrible. He doesn't read exam essays, he just counts pages. Talks about his life and nothing relating to the course. Uses offensive language often. I cannot wait to never see this man again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	4	4	4	224390	5/14/10	Attendance- mandatory & class is at 8am. Best method is to car pool for motivation. Class is ALL about sports & exercise. VERY good class. Smoke something if you have to right b4 entering. Exams are just based on what you can remember & put it in writing. PS- that person who previously commented gave a bad review yet can't even spell right.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	438	1	1	4	224390	3/30/10	Not sure where his good reviews are coming from. Doesn't matter how much i study, i cannot get above 'B+/A-'. Tests are essay format with no actual question. Class is extremely boring and grade is based solely on how fast you can right. Do not take this class unless you like getting up at 7am OR have exceptionally fast handwritting
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	405	4	5	4	224390	11/12/09	Raynor was terrific. Easy to understand, interesting, I have nothing bad to say about this Prof. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology	404	5	3	4	224390	11/13/08	you have to be interested in the course to do well. i like him, his tests are essays which i like because if you read its very easy to prove and youll do well, you basically choose what you want to cover on the tests. just write a lot. good class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	5	4	4	224390	4/24/08	rambles a little bit but over all a decent professor. The tests are easy just write a lot on the exam and you'll get an A(7-8 pages). I dont think he really reads them just looks to see if you have alot of content. I emjoyed the class and him as teacher I'm going to take his alcohol&health class in the fall.He does require you attend lec.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology		1	1	1	224390	5/11/06	well, i don't know who wants to sign up for 400 Level class...if i am taking 300 and struggling..okay got three exams in the class the one i did worse i got good grade..the one i did good i got worse grades..is that crappy...well, i managed to talk to Professor and he looked at my Exams again and gave me better grades but you need to talk out man..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology	404	5	2	1	224390	10/27/11	EASY A! But this is the most boring class I have ever taken, and I slept the majority of the semester in that class. Tests are essay and tells you exactly what you need to write on it to get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	438	1	1	3	224390	4/5/11	Pretty sure he doesn't know how to read. But I'm positive he doesn't know how to teach. I was very disappointed with this class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	342	1	1	5	224390	4/5/11	One of the most unpleasant classes I've ever taken.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	438	4	1	4	224390	11/2/10	I was interested to take this, but it's not what I thought. Boring as hell. Attendance MANDATORY 3 free absences, after that ea. absence = 1 letter grade he takes off your total grade at the end. Tests are easy- all slides are provided. Remember whatever you want for each chapter, then write BIG. Aim for 10-15 pages you'll get an A in course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	5	4	5	224390	4/30/10	Raynors class will put you to sleep if you aren't interested in the material. I loved it tons of sports stories and whatnot but that's just me. As far as your grade, it's coming from attendance and exams. Exams are pure texbook copying 10-15pgs and you'll get an A pretty sure he grades on length so font size > knowledge honestly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology	404	3	1	2	224390	11/22/09	do not take this class attendance is mandatory and he takes it at the beginning and end of class so you cant come late or leave early. he spends 90% of lectures talking about himself and not anything that is going to be on the tests. the tests are terrible all essays with no question just write everything you can remember. i
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology	404	5	3	3	224390	10/22/09	extremely boring, attendance is mandatory, so bring some homework to do because he teaches you absolutely nothing. exams are essay style, he basically counts the pages, the more you have, the better you do. you have to read the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology	438	5	2	4	224390	11/6/08	Extremely easy. Tests are all in essay format and easy just write a lot. Need to read the text book though. As long as u cover the main points from the book on the exams you will be fine. He rambles a lot but if u appreciate sports and fitness its not all that bad. Attendence is mandatory.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	5	4	1	224390	12/13/07	so easy! you just need to go to class... The papers are easy becuase he doesn't read them. just make sure you take up space. If you write 4 pages you will get a C, 6 pages you will get a B and 8 pages you will get an A. He counts the pages and grades you on that.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	2	Psychology	438	5	4	4	224390	10/17/05	Easiest psychology class you can take. For the exams you have 60 minutes to write 10 pages, if you write 10 pages of total BS, you will get at worst a B+. Very easy, lectures are boring, but you need to go. Class is an easy A, dont listen to the other reviews!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology		2	1	3	224390	10/11/05	oh my god! This guy is terrible. Very lazy. You have 60 minutes, NOT 1hr 20min to write the essay. I wrote 5 pages in an hour and got a D+ . Everybody in the class was pissed. waste of time really.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology	438	3	3	5	224390	11/15/04	He's lazy. He doesn't create own ppt slides; we have to download the read only formats from ublearns and we can't change them, sometimes they don't print in the libraries. He doesn't make his own tests and we have to just write essays. He makes the subject boring, makes cartoon character noises.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology		5	4		224390	6/24/03	He's a nice man. He seems a little shy though. Very helpful. Bends over backwards to help you out. Tests are fair & easy. Good lectures. Can go off on a few tangents. Other than that your sure to get an A+!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	0	Psychology		2	2	4	224390	8/30/05	He doesn't teach anything at all. He relys solely on the textbook, which you might as well plan on memorizing word for word if you intend on passing this class. Also, his voice could put anyone to sleep
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joel Raynor	2.6	1	Psychology		5	3		224390	7/26/04	really boring voice can put you to sleep no matter what time of day, tests are kinda fustrating b/c you have 1 hr 20 min to write 2 four page essays and there the big books not the small ones
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	404	4	5	5	429595	6/26/09	Thanks Madam! I really enjoy your class!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	4	4	2	429595	5/8/08	I don't usually comment on professors, but I feel like prof. read was very fair. Her online quizzes were open book, so you could access the quiz to get the questions and you have a week to submit it. Lectures were interesting, and she included videos of disorders and guest speakers who dealt with depression and substance abuse. Highly recommend her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	5	5	4	429595	4/29/08	Lots of chances to do good in the class since there are online quizzes, essay, tests, and clickers. The tests are really easy if you just look at the powerpoint slides. You have to go to class since 30 points of the class are clickers. I enjoyed the class and never felt overwhelmed by any of the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	0	Psychology	322	1	1	2	429595	4/16/08	She is a very hard professor. 94% of the total points is considered an A. Her quizzes do not test your knowledge of Abnormal Psychology rather on how well you can pick up details from the textbook. Her tests are easier than her quizzes. You can only lose 13 points if you want an A. Her TA's grade papers and they are horrible graders. BAD professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	0	Psychology		1	1	4	429595	4/11/05	Not a good prof, avoid her at all costs!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	3	4	5	429595	1/26/05	I worked for this A. Extremely intelligent and knowledgable. She is the kind of teacher that could provide a great reccommendation later on, but her class is kinda difficult. I love the novel and the course material, but watch out for the quizzes she gives...in my class they were pretty awful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	2	4	4	429595	11/8/04	She did a lot of things to try to get students engaged in the course (like speakers, reading a novel), and had lots of different assignements so that people could do well if they wanted to.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	0	Psychology		1	1	5	429595	10/10/04	Didn't like her, didn't think she was hot. Not clear and didn't learn much in the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	3	5	4	429595	10/11/08	Dr. Read is a really smart person and very knowledgeable about mental health disorders. The book we read was enjoyable. The class was challenging, but I'm glad I took it. I got an A- with a lot of studying. These are the standards we SHOULD be held to in order to grow. Recommend if you're motivated and care about learning.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	1	Psychology	322	3	3	3	429595	5/4/08	Does give a lot of chances to do well in the class. I would reccommend, i mean you do have to put in some work but if you do it well your grade will show that.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	5	5	5	429595	4/28/08	An extremely fair professor with plenty of chances to do well in this class. Go to class, it's worth an easy 30 of the 200 possible points. Read the book and keep up with it. You read a novel in the class, but it is very interesting and you just do a reading quiz online about it. Interesting material and good lecture notes. Good guest speakers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology		3	5	4	429595	5/13/05	talks too fast but after awhile u get used to it. Lots of quizzes and diverse methods of teaching. the fact that she has so much to grade you on enables u to get a good grade if u actually do the readings. quizzes every other week keep u reading, which help in the long run. no final (usually).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	0	Psychology		2	2	5	429595	2/27/05	too unorganized, unclear on essay, changes notes she posts 5 mins before class... if you can avoid definitly do that
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology	322	5	3	5	429595	1/11/05	Very good class. She talks kinda fast though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	0	Psychology	322	2	1	4	429595	11/7/04	talks way too fast, is unclear and disorganized. always changing lecture notes last minute and when u get to class, u'll be missing notes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jennifer Read	3.3	2	Psychology		2	5		429595	7/2/04	Excellent teacher. One of the best I have had. Also very HOT. I only say this to compliment her. Her "hotness" in no way detracts from my appraisal of her teaching. I only wish she would let us call her Jen. It would make her more approach
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	203	2	2	3	391109	11/28/10	He's now at Boise State, and is terribly inconsistent in his teaching and grading. He's tolerable and interesting for the most part, but when he's not having a good day he likes to fixate on random students and repeatedly call on them out of the blue. Wish he'd start practicing the psychology he's been preaching to us future educators.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	101	2	1	4	391109	10/12/07	Do not take psych from him. His notes are obscure and he puts way too much personal info from lecture on tests. One question on the test was where did he work when he was 15?? Who cares, you have to go to lecture and read the text, which is way to much work for a gen. ed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	101	3	2	4	391109	12/1/06	He was not very interesting at all. During lectures it seemed as though he did not actually know what he was talking about and was only reading of the notes which you cana read yourself at home (because they are online). Tests were ok but he the only way you'll do good is if you listen to him and that is very hard, because he is SO BORING.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	101	1	1	1	391109	10/2/06	He sucks, exams were difficult, exam questions contained questions about his personal life, sometimes forgets what he was talking about, not exactly an expert in the field (hey, no one is perfect) very corny, he's no Jerry Lewis in my opinion. Take someone else, avoid this guy, he sucks (as stated earlier).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	101	2	1	5	391109	4/17/06	dont take his class! His lectures are chock full of way too much personal information and the test questions are WAY obscure
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	2	Psychology	101	4	3	3	391109	12/12/05	He's a funny guy....his tests are pretty easy....doesn't use test book, ; lecture notes are online ver batum so attendence really doesn't amtter except for a few questions based on remarks he makes in lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	0	Psychology	101	1	1		391109	4/21/04	his vague notes don't help on tests, usually gets off topic, his lectures are very vague as well . . . doesn't know how to teach that well. basically, if you take his class, depend on the text book because his notes and lectures don't help much
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	1	Psychology	101	3	3	3	391109	7/26/08	You either love him or hate him. I took his class for a few weeks and did poorly on the first two tests. I ended up dropping the class and retaking it with ****ord. I did much better in her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	2	Psychology	101	5	3	5	391109	1/22/07	Me and my boyfriend LOVED this class. He was fun and entertaining, and he made the time fly by quickly. He told lots of stories about himself and his daughter,some of which are on the tests which make for easy points. Does seem a little uncertain about some things, but overall is pretty good.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	391109	11/10/06	He says his class is "fun fun fun" on the first day and many days after that. I have to admit he does tell some good jokes...he tells at least a few jokes and funny or stories about himself every single day. His class is fun to go to because he electronically polls the audience all the time. IF you read the text you will get good grades!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	2	Psychology	101	5	5	3	391109	9/15/06	If you need a psyc class, take it from this guy. He likes to tell stories about his life that help you remember information in an easy way. This class fills up really quickly so you are lucky if you can get into it because lots of people don't...This class is easy if you just sit and listen to the lectures.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	1	Psychology	101	4	3	3	391109	4/13/06	I didn't like him very much. He's very opinionated, and was fixated on persisting with bad jokes (he admitted to wanting to do stand-up comedy) and personal stories, but then couldn't convey actual course material very well. Exams are a barrage of somewhat abstract multiple choice questions, but reading the text should get you through just fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Joshua Redford	2.7	2	Psychology	101	2	4	4	391109	11/29/04	This guy is aspiring to be a lame standup comedian. He uses his psych class as an audience. Don't bother going to class unless you want to be bored by this guys "funny" personal stories.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexander Reid	4.5	2	English	101	4	5	4	1324224	1/23/11	overall easy, just do her work and you will get a good grade. very fun topics, but requires some reading
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Alexander Reid	4.5	2	English		3	5	4	1324224	1/9/10	Professor Reid is amazing. This class should be required. It's basically about art and society in the digital age. Topics included the internet, hypertext, digital copyright/file sharing, remixing & more. The class is based around casual discussion. The assignments were unique. You probably won't like this class if you're techno-illiterate, though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Carlo Ramil	4.0	2	Chemistry	101	4	4	2	1623449	10/31/12	Great TA. Slight accent but not a big deal. Goes over specific quiz material right before you take the quiz. Always willing to help and answer questions
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Thomas Ramming	1.0	0	Education	5	3	1	5	869782	7/28/06	I took negotiations; 3 assign. 1st, short paper, no grade just comments (said he has high expectations and suggested we should take class p/f, almost everyone did). 2nd & 3rd assignment was due the second last class. This meant you have NO grade or idea how youre doing until he handed them back the last class. That's pedagogically reprehensible!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Neel  Rao	4.5	2	Economics	505	4	5	5	1780584	12/12/12	Enjoyed his class a lot, especially the exams. I am sure you'll find a lot of people complaining about them but I'll put it like this. His exams are purely conceptual, and you'll have a lot of fun solving them if you like a nice brain tease. Extremely organized, his material is always updated online. Classes are good, focuses on fundamentals.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	2	Women's Studies		5	5	5	416907	3/6/06	She is super nice, as long as you come to class on time and participate. Reading is not necessary. She doesnt give the grades, her TA does. So, if you want to do well, it's up to them not her. She does have favorites, so make sure you compliment her or agree with her. This easy A is definately worth the boredom!!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	1	Women's Studies		5	3	5	416907	4/5/05	what a waste of time
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	2	Women's Studies		4	5		416907	5/29/04	prof. rapping is an amazing professor. shes so knowledgable in media studies and popular culture. and she makes a point that research and learning about media studies is actually important. This lady is my role model.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	0	Women's Studies	384	5	2	2	416907	12/14/05	not a very interesting class, some movie are hard to find, difficult to stay awake at times because of boredom. has one theory of film and doesnt budge,also likes the sound of her own rambling voice. easy class to do well in, but still not worth it, take something else. also seemed to have a group of students she knew and prefered in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	2	Women's Studies		3	4	5	416907	9/21/05	Amazing professor and mentor...if she likes you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elayne Rapping	3.3	2	Women's Studies		3	3		416907	7/23/04	When you do presentations she looks at you like you're retarded. It doesn't help the process ... :-X
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sunada Ray	2.5	1	History	112	2	3	1	1159358	4/17/09	T.A. for McCarthy,T. Accent is fine, u can still understand her. Hard grader, will take points off for spelling mistakes. And group discussions are hell because she grades participation, everyone must speak. For recitation u will have to read the textbook chapters in order to participate. Not horrible T.A. but could find a better one.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sunada Ray	2.5	0	History		3	2	2	1159358	7/29/08	She is really not a good profes, she doesn't speak english correctly and she taught it which made it very hard to deal with, and her workload is unrealistic so good luck!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	4	4	761088	4/20/09	she is the best
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	5	5	4	761088	1/13/09	I absolutely love her. She's an awesome professor and wouldn't have a second thought about taking her. Exams are straight from "review quizzes" that aren't graded or even looked at. Films are interesting. Easy A. Great professor =)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	0	Anthropology	111	2	1	2	761088	11/22/08	Extremely boring. Her British accent made me sleep. She is even not a fair grader. Gives practice questions, but they are not good(¬ important) questions. A lot of exam questions are now not from that practice questions, and movie quiz sucks. She sucks overall
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	0	Anthropology	211	1	1	1	761088	11/22/08	Incredibly boring class and picky tests. I hated this class. never take her!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	0	Anthropology	112	5	1	2	761088	3/7/08	You will get an easy A but won't learn anything. This class is a joke.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	101	5	5	3	761088	1/22/07	Get ready to bring a billow and a balnket to Prof. Razak's class because she will put you to sleep. The lectures are unnecessary and you don't really have to attend any of them. Go to all recitations and yo uwill have to try to NOT get an A. The class is a joke, the tests are a joke, the teacher is a joke, and so is the essay. Easy requirement!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	5	5	761088	12/11/06	Professor treated us like middle schoolers. It was a little annoying but her class was easier than you could dream. We were given the practice quizes and the tests were just questions from those quizes. Boring class but very little work. One 5 min presentation and a couple of short papers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	5	3	761088	10/31/06	Her "practice quizes" are basically the tests. You go over the answers and short answers during recitation. She shows films/clips during class. I feel bad for this class because you do nothing and don't go to a lecture and you'll end up with a decent grade. Very nice, helpful, and approachable. Good way to get rid of your gen eds
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology		5	5	4	761088	4/7/06	best professor for world civ! her lectures are boring and dont have anything to do with what is on the exam, you really dont need to go to any of them. shw shows films allll the time. her tests are the exact same question off the practive quizzes in recitation. This class is an easy A!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	5	5	1	761088	1/26/06	this lady is the sweetest professor ever! Her tests are so easy, she actually tells you whats goin to be on the test. This professor is one of those professors who wants everyone to get an A. TAKE HER!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! I PROMISE!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	2	5	5	761088	2/11/09	great!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	1	Anthropology	111	5	3	1	761088	12/9/08	[Requirements: REC presentation, 3 tests (w/final), paper] I love her British accent, she gives you all the questions for the test before hand so just go over those with other people and you're guaranteed to do well. She wants everyone to get A's. She also shows a lot of films which is nice. Easy A but you won't learn anything.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	0	Anthropology	112	1	3	1	761088	11/22/08	she's okay, and helpful teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	3	3	3	761088	3/14/08	Best teacher at UB
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	5	5	761088	3/4/08	She is the best history teacher I had! Her tests are all questions from the practice quizzes, and she'll throw out any bad confusing questions. She's really nice, and doesn't make you memorize every single historical date. I liked her lectures; I didn't mind going. If it's an early section, it's a nice wake up class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	4	5	3	761088	12/29/06	She's very nice but the lectures have nothing to do with the exams. Go to recitation and do all of the quizzes bc she takes questions from each quiz and puts them all in one exam....easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	5	1	761088	11/29/06	Prof Razak is nice and her class is easy but sometimes its boring. The TA took one of the lectures for her and was way better. learn the answers to the quizzes and get an A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	4	2	761088	8/7/06	Awesome teacher! Tests questions are given in quizzes beforehand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	112	5	5	4	761088	4/4/06	If you want to take an easy 3 credits to get out of your world civ requirement, this class is for you. She gives you the test questions before you take the test. No attendence taken at lectures. Lecture notes are posted online. There is no need to actually comprehend information, just know the answers to the test beforehand.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	761088	1/19/06	she is the definition of cool. take the class with her. you won't regret it
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	5	3	2	761088	1/17/06	She was a funny teacher. Her tests were easy, and we watched a lot of "interesting" videos. All notes were posted online.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	4	3	3	761088	11/22/05	didn't like her at 1st but she grew on me. watch movies all the time. don't really have to go to class but go to recitation.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	5	5	5	761088	12/26/05	She can hold ur interest at 10am as opposed to other professors
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Victoria Razak-Cole	4.0	2	Anthropology	111	4	4	2	761088	11/18/05	3 exams, 1 final. she lets you know everything on the exams which she posts on a website. all the notes can also be found on the website. one 5-pg term paper at the end (double spaced!) we watch a movie almost every week. no rec tests, except we had to read articles and respond to them almost every week. i liked it more than i thought i would.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages	350	4	5	1	396357	4/5/13	FUN CLASS..never a dull moment with him. Very Easy class as long as you read all the stories. There is no textbook, everything is posted online. The assignments are not hard and he lets you revise your 2 papers for a better grade. He takes attendance so make sure to go to class. He's very helpful during office hours as well as in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages	449	5	5	4	396357	11/7/07	This is a Portuguese class, and it is awesome! He makes the lectures interesting, and we speak more than we write, so there is a lot of practical use of the language. The only problem is that the textbook is a cd ROM, which is incompatible with Macs. We had to do everything at home on the computer, which is slightly difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages	415	4	5	5	396357	8/27/05	knows his stuff; was able to give brief background on history and culture on latin america to provide context for poetry. keep up on the coursework and you'll be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages		2	3		396357	4/27/04	He is hard to please.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	1	Languages	111	2	2	3	396357	12/7/10	He is not always willing to help. I don't know if it is personal but he doesn't always respond. The class itself is interesting but professors level of Spanish Grammar is limited which is a downfall!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages	450	5	5	4	396357	3/8/06	Brazilian Lit in Translation turned out to be a great class. Tests are pretty easy if you keep up with the reading. Weekly assignments are relatively straightforward and class discussions will keep you entertained.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Justin Read	4.5	2	Languages	102	4	5		396357	8/24/04	He knows what he's talking about and is probably the best language teacher in the entire school. I learned so much about the language, Brazil and its culture. Five stars, like Siskel and the late Ebert.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rohit Reddy	4.4	2	Biology	100	1	3	1	1531526	1/7/12	Helpful but he was BORING...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rohit Reddy	4.4	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1531526	5/11/11	was my lab TA in ECC and UB for 2 classes at the same time.Extremely helpful and fair but too detailed and his accent is a mix of american,british Indian and rich people's accent.Sometimes flirts with everyone?.Besides that he is pretty cool.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rohit Reddy	4.4	2	Biology	198	2	5	1	1531526	11/8/11	I had C- in the class but the lab helped my grade like crazy. he tutored me for 3 hours one time for free cuz he really wanted me to do good! hoping he still in UB. Plus gals...hes CUTE;)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rohit Reddy	4.4	2	Biology	200	2	5	2	1531526	4/27/11	He had his "favorite" kids in the lab which is unfair.But he was very helpful and used to go out of his way to help us with quizzes and the lab final.Always talks about how evolution is cool.Very intimidating sometimes.He's easy on the eyes though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	4	5	279156	4/11/13	Easy B/A class. Just do the problems that he assigns right before a quiz or exam and you will do very well. Need the book to do homework problems and studying. Attendance is key. Take him and you'll learn pre calc and if you stay on top of your work and study you'll get a an A/B
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	3	279156	12/10/12	Donald Reed is the greatest thing to happen to math at UB. He loves the subject and has so much passion and enthusiasm in his lessons. Cutest little old man ever. Attendance is mandatory, and you need to buy the book for homework. He will help a student outside of class whenever they ask. Donald is awesome!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	4	279156	11/12/12	This is one of the easiest class I am taken. He plans out his lesson before hand and he goes over every homework that is given out. He gives out prep questions in the textbook to help us with the quiz and test. he is willing to let you take an exam or quiz early or late if you have a valid excuse. Its cute when he makes minor mistakes!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	2	1	1	279156	10/25/12	Has a tendency to teach fast, and if you cannot make office hours good luck trying to get in contact with him. Lots of assignments and quizzes, Exams aren't overly difficult. Try to avoid him if possible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	3	5	279156	11/16/11	Can teach fast, but easy class. Gives you the problems to study for tests/quizzes and gives homework only once a week. Easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	2	1	3	279156	2/22/10	Terrible. He teaches way too fast, you don't even have time to comprehend one thing before he jumps into another. If you can't make his office hours, you're s.o.l. He's not willing to help much.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	4	279156	6/4/09	EASY A, JUST GO TO CLASS AND DO ASSIGNED HW AND YOUR GOOD TO GO.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	3	4	2	279156	11/20/08	gives out good notes. only gives homework once a week. lets you re-do any homework assignment, extra credit packets replace quizzes. tests are long but nothing that hasn't been covered. overall good teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	1	1	1	279156	11/18/08	Not as easy how you think he is going to be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	1	279156	10/15/08	Don't let the pre-test make you feel like you can't do it. I did terribly because I hadn't taken math in 2 years, but it turns out the pre-test is the hardest part of the course. Reed is really clear and easy. Definitely get him! I'm not even good at math and I have a 97!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	4	3	279156	1/13/13	This class is not hard but I don't like the professor very much. I had 92 class average, but i did 3 extra credit assignments by hoping to get 93 (one more point) to get an A but didn't work. He gave only .3 (92.3) for extra credits. So, got A-. He is not generous at all. He doesn't look at you behavior or participation. Avoid him if you can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	128	5	5	2	279156	12/9/12	EASIST CLASSEVER i swear, and im HORRIBLE at math, and he's super adorable
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	2	279156	11/7/12	Professor Reed is an amazing teacher. I had not taken a math in a year prior to his class so I was extremely worried about taking this class. He is very clear with his notes and very understandable. He gets your grades back to you very quickly, and is generous with grades. One of my favorite teachers, I definitely recommend him! Cutest old man ever
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	4	4	279156	2/10/12	He is very good. he gives lots of assignments, but once you do them you will pass the exam because he just changes the numbers. With little work it is an easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	1	1	1	279156	3/1/10	He is the worst teacher ever. He makes you take down pages of notes. Marks you off 26 points for one problem even though you got the right answer. Avoid him at all costs!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	3	279156	10/13/09	Love donald.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	2/26/09	AWWESOME! A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	1	1	1	279156	11/18/08	Look dont let the "nice" comments fool you. He gives too much work, so time consuming and these extra packets = headache! so dont take him :)unless u want a C.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	1	3	1	279156	11/18/08	ill be straight out so you dont have to suffer or regret taking him like i did. he is boring,tough,confusing & he goes over time a lot. it takes soo much time doing hws. attendance is mandatory. i dont kno why or how people are thinking he's easy or great. recommend that you dont take him. soo hard just to get ONLY C. you need to work a LOt for him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	4	4	279156	8/25/08	explains everything clearly, n just keep doing graded homework n attend classes will get an easy A. =P
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	1	279156	4/9/08	really knows what he's talking about. goes over everything. need to come to class. grades a homework every week, but as long as you do it you'll be fine. need to do the homework to keep up. don't fall behind. he's helpful & goes over graded homework problems before asking to hand them in. great teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	4	279156	3/3/08	he's a really good teacher! attendance is mandatory, and the homework time consuming, but he genuinely wants us to understand the material. i highly recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	3	3	1	279156	11/27/07	Goes at a really fast pace if you are not very good with math don't take him. You would want a teacher who goes at a slower pace. Homework is reasonable. Lots of notes, read textbook
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	3	4	2	279156	4/11/07	Graded homework every Monday. Quizzes throughout the semester which are not very hard. Tests are a little more difficult
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	4/1/07	GREAT
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	5	279156	3/13/07	Algebra & Trigonometry pre-Calculus class: Reed is clear; takes time to explain topics; is willing to work with the student after class; sticks to the syllabus/schedule. A weekly homework assignment is collected & graded. Gives in-class review & review problems prior to quizzes and exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	12/5/06	Prof Reed is probably the nicest guy you'll ever meet. His class is sooo easyyyy... he is thorough, goes at a slower pace to avoid confusion. he only collects certain homeworks for a grade, and they're never extensive assignments. quizzes are easy, tests are a little harder but still fair. best math class to satisfy requirements
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	1/4/06	he's an awesome teacher. explains everything in detail with lots of examples. he gives practice questions before the test as well. he's a quiet guy and never gets mad. and homework that is graded is due every monday, u don't have to do the other word. he's an awesome teacher. goes slow and is willing to teach and enjoys is. notes and examples
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	4	4	279156	11/26/05	Easy easy easy! Graded homework every monday, which takes about a half hour to do. Very clear notes, goes with the book. Takes attendance every class, gives review questions before every quiz and test. Easy-going guy, you can make up quizzes and tests with any medical excuse (no proof needed).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	2	1	2	279156	11/21/05	he over explains to the point where he doesn't make sense, he goes REALLY fast and wasn't very helpful. He doesn't simplify anything, it's pretty hard to pay attention, he's really boring
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	2	279156	4/5/08	He is sometimes a little bit boring, but he makes the class EXTREMELY easy. If you don't get above a B in this class, you should just drop out of college, because he literally makes it impossible to do poorly. He once taught high school math, so he knows all of the great little tricks to help remember things. He is great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	3	5	5	279156	1/22/08	Easy professor, but you MUST catch up with the material. I was extremely behind in Math when taking this course and am now taking and loving calculus. You can pretty much take a test over if you have eve a poor excuse. He rathers you understand material rather than making you fail without knowing why. He teaches fast, but he also covers basic calc.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	1	279156	7/15/07	I was required to take this course for gen ed and was initially not so excited about it. As the semester went on, I actually began to enjoy the course, no lie! It's been a long time since I've taken a math course, but he made it difficult to do poorly in this course. He is an excellent teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	4	279156	4/7/07	Prof reed is the easiest math teacher ever! an easy A in his class if you do your homeworks and work the sample test and quiz questions he gives b4 any exam! If you want to make the A, go to Reed!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	5	3	279156	3/29/07	This is an easy class ass long as you have the pre-requs. and you do your hw. It doesnt take much time and hes willing to go over anything you need.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	2	2	3	279156	3/12/07	I can't see why people think this man is good....I'm average in math too and for me I feel like screaming in his class because no matter how hard i try I cant understand it, and he doesn'thelp at all. very bad. do not take this teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	2	3	2	279156	3/8/06	I wish I knew why all the other raters found him so great... I'm average-skilled in math, and I found him to be extremely boring, confusing, and tough. This class is making me nuts. I really wish I took it wish a different teacher. Spending a lot of $$ on a tutor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	12/26/05	the class was a breeze. he gave review problems for both test and quizes and the exact type of question was on the test/quiz. hes available for extrahelp and theres extra credit! only problem is he goes REALLY slow...but if youre not good at math thats a good thing!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	4	4	279156	11/25/05	He's an awesome professor. He teaches this course very clearly and to the point.He arranges his homeworks well too...I liked his class..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	4	3	1	279156	11/19/05	He ia SO boring, always runs over the class time...he really needs to retire...soon!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	5	279156	10/26/05	I loved him! He's old and he's sweet. He lets you make things up if you need to, I had this kid never come to class then the day of the test hed make up some lame excuse that he was in the hospital and Reed would always let him take the test at a later time. He's fair on hw, and quizzes. He's always there when you need help, and there's even extra credit! Awesome teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	0	Mathematics	148	1	1	3	279156	5/18/05	goes too fast, doesn't explain problems /questions you have. tests and quizzes are very hard, grades the h.w....bascially sign up for a different professor if you have him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	4	4	1	279156	11/20/04	he invented time and quite possibly the number 0 which might be why he knows so much math
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	5	4		279156	4/13/04	Not really my favourite professor...not my favourite class. Far from it, in fact. But if I'd never learned the material before, things would be different. Still, his method of teaching, compared to the way I learned it, is totally obscure.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5		279156	3/12/04	He's the best math teacher on earth. His work is very easy, he's very lenient and explains very well. If only the class wasn't so boring I wouldn't fall asleep.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	279156	9/12/05	Really easy class and super helpful. Always letsyou finish test later if you need more time(or studying).He's old and hard to follow at times. Boring as hell too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	5	3	279156	4/24/05	Excellent Teacher...Very Fair..If you have his old tests and quizes you are set
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	4	2	1	279156	9/23/04	He's the oldest, sexiest man alive!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	1	Mathematics	148	3	3		279156	4/11/04	explains everything but is really boring... he does things differnt from how i learned it but the class isnt so bad it could be worse..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donald Reed	3.8	2	Mathematics	148	5	4		279156	11/7/03	The easiest math course I have ever taken. Only assigns short homework assignments, teaches somewhat quickly, but teaches very well. Grade composed of homework, attendance (takes it every day) 6 quizes, and 3 majors.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	2	1	3	21243	11/9/11	Super weird guy. Very smart, which makes him hard to comprehend. Doesn't give clear directions for weekly assignments that take up all of your free time. Lectures and Textbook unhelpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	4	21243	11/8/11	omg he's super hot!!!! and a great professor.. i hated programming until i took his class.. now i wanna be the next martha stewarts of c++ =]
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	4	21243	11/8/11	He's the best professor I've ever had, I'm lucky to have taken classes under such a brilliant man. :D. His homeworks are extremely easy and he's very helpful and detailed with his assignments. Clear assignments, you'll definitely know what he wants you to do. A chess god reppin' UB, the real Big Blue.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	2	2	4	21243	11/7/11	Lectures don't make any sense and he gets off topic a lot. Have avoided him in office hours due to the horror stories older students have told me. Assignments are time consuming and are near-impossible without the internet/external help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	1	2	5	21243	11/1/11	Good guy, and tries to be helpful. However moves too fast for 90% of the class, and doesn't present the material in clear ways. Projects also very time consuming.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	1	Computer Science	191	2	4	5	21243	5/21/11	Regan is obviously a genius, but that sometimes does not translate well to teaching. Assignments were not extremely hard(minus the last few), and they provided a nice way to boost your grade. Tests were very hard, more because you could not understand what the questions were asking. No correlation to lecture and book. Office hours are helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	2	5	4	21243	10/1/10	Really good when you go into office hours, and very helpful in any 1 on 1 interaction. Go to office hours and use the book, because honestly, it's really hard to stay focused and fully understand what's going on in lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	396	1	5	4	21243	5/1/10	Make no mistake, this man is an utter genius. Not only that, but he is insanely helpful. He answers emails almost 24/7 and really truly wants you to understand the material. He loves his work. He overestimates the intellect of the students sometimes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	396	4	5	5	21243	3/22/10	Hard working teacher. He response email after mid night too, which is great help. It's funny that he rubs his stomach most of the time and look at his cell phone to for time management purpose. He loves teaching, its fun to take his class, Theory of Computation (CSC 396) SP 2010
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	1	Computer Science	250	1	3	3	21243	12/18/09	Projects will dominate over all other classes. Hw's are easy, but tests are hard. His wording in notes and project descriptions make no sense. Teaches at a high level, and really knows his stuff. This is not an easy class. Paying attention to projects and homeworks will help you on the tests, otherwise good luck.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	4	2	21243	11/8/11	Took him for data structures (CSE250) and Discrete Math (191). Really really good professor, gives straight forward examples, doesn't complicate things, and wants his whole class to get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	3	21243	11/8/11	Awesome course, decently easy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	4	3	21243	11/8/11	Not sure why so many people on here are complaining, very clear lectures. Material is hard but Regan makes it really easy. Homeworks take like 25 minutes max. Really likes chess.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	250	5	5	4	21243	11/7/11	He is the best teacher in this whole University, possibly world! Super Easy! Very Understandable! Brings a beach ball to class all the time and the last ten minutes of class is just amazing!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	1	Computer Science	191	1	3	2	21243	5/21/11	Dr. Regan is a tough professor for this class. Main reason is, he hasn't taught the class in 10 years. His lectures were very confusing, and the assignments were near impossible without external help. The class is challenging if logic isn't your thing. Take the class if you need to, but try to avoid if you can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	1	2	2	21243	4/20/11	It took a while understand his assignment, and his teaching in class is very messy. Be prepared to read the whole book. If you go to office hour, you'll benefit a LOT! And for the project, get compile your code at Timberlake before submitting using some old-fashioned way.I cannot believe this course is not using Visual studio which makes it easier
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	396	2	5	1	21243	5/5/10	He was extremely helpful and willing to answer questions during office hours and through e-mail. I'm glad I was able to take this class with Regan. He tried to make it entertaining and would talk about things like Dungeons & Dragons during class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	396	1	4	4	21243	4/15/10	A nice teacher, very intelligent. Often goes above the heads of the students and is absorbed in the world of proofs and computers, but he is kind and helpful. The students here are just frustrated because his classes seem to be pretty difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	396	4	5	3	21243	3/22/10	Tries very hard to makes things clear, receptive to suggestions from students. Cares very much about students' comprehension and success.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	1	Computer Science	250	1	2	4	21243	12/18/09	He is a nice guy if you go to his office hours. However, as a teacher he won't stood down to your level and some of the stuff said in class is incomprehensible. You will do well if you do his projects and homeworks (lots of effort), the exams are based on hws and projects. All in all not a terrible professor but not an easy going one either.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	1	1	3	21243	12/4/09	this guy is obsessed with chess and programming... inappropriately rubs his belly during class and talks about his outside life and things with no correlation to his class... worst teacher i've every had... will frustrate you to your breaking point and possibly beyond... dont take him!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	3	2	2	21243	10/12/09	He is an alien teaching to himself. Cannot comprehend him.Always confsed
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	1	Computer Science	305	1	4	3	21243	11/22/08	This guy is a mad scientist. Reminds of Professor Fink (eigan glaven), but crazier. Has an unhealthy obsession with chess-playing computers. Is rather pompous. Once remarked that he first met Sipser (author of the textbk) on a train in Denmark. Claims to know the inventor of the B prog. language. Tests are RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT. otherwise,OK
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	305	3	3	5	21243	12/13/05	If you have to take 305, do it with someone else. Other people have enjoyed this class, to me it was a nightmare. We covered 4 programming languages, 8 weeks was spent on java 1.5... avoid this class with Dr. Regan
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	2	Computer Science	596	1	4	1	21243	1/26/05	Do not take 596 for fun, but it is extremely useful and informative material. Dr. Regan is an excellent professor who knows the material completely and is capable of expressing it in a conscise form.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science		1	1		21243	12/10/03	he's a jerk, don't take his class, he's evil i'll tell ya
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	396	1	3		21243	6/19/03	He pushes difficult matterial at you at a unbelievable pace, then tells you how dumb you are. He is very smart but doesn't understand everyone is not like him. Always meets w/ you but still very difficult to get the point most of the time. Stay away.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	305	1	1		21243	2/18/03	Tests for IQ, not subject mastery. Weeds out all students with IQs below 180.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	250	2	2	5	21243	10/30/09	Avoid at all costs! Terrible professor, just goes up front and talks about whatever he wants and doesn't care if you understand or not. Less than half the class was able to even Compile their homeworks, much less have it actually work. Assignments are just huge blocks of text. Expects students to read hundreds of pages in very short time periods.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	305	1	2	4	21243	4/20/09	Truly enjoys his field, CSE. Intentionally exploits stupidity from students (makes fake erroneous programs to waste class time). Curves by adjusting question points afterwards but expect classes to be harder than they need to be.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	305	1	1	5	21243	3/25/08	The most pompous person, let alone professor, I have ever met. Acts as if we are wasting his valuable time. He would skip grading assignments to write chess articles. Constantly had errors on his assignments and tests. Avoid him at all costs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	305	1	1	4	21243	12/12/05	VERY disorganized, does not proofread assignments before distributing (EVERY assignment had numerous corrections to both wording and often REQUIREMENTS), acts like this is the only course you're taking (assigned HW during the last week of classes to be due during finals). No, he's not a genius--he adds lots of pomp to otherwise simple concepts.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	596	1	2	3	21243	11/3/04	Easy material made impossible to comprehend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ken Regan	2.5	0	Computer Science	396	2	1		21243	12/8/03	Aviod like the plauge

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	2	Law		5	4	2	222548	11/29/11	Took advanced over the summer...didn't seem advanced however I did not get an advanced grade even though I thought I was doing really really well. Def thought I had A work. Not sure about the favorites thing but an enjoyable experience.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law	1	2	1	4	222548	6/16/11	One of the worst professors I've ever had in my college career. She does blatantly play favorites. She gives "tips", but does not teach the information. Her grading scale is a mystery. A student asked in class how her grade corresponded to the A-F scale and the professor responded, it doesn't, so don't try to figure it out. Glad it's over!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	5	222548	6/28/09	Reilly definitley plays favorites (just look at ALL the comments). Two students with briefs containing EXACTLY THE SAME substance rec'd two drastically different grades and both students agreed that the forms of each brief weren't that different. She's amazingly picky about the form of questions you ask and never quite answers them.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law	515	1	2	5	222548	11/5/08	She's a mixed bag. If you're one of her favorite students, you're good to go. If not, good luck. She teaches Bluebook citations really well. She has specific expectations for her assignments but doesn't tell you what those expectations are. When she does give instructions, they are confusing and contradictory. She doesn't know how to answer q
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	3	222548	12/6/07	Those of you who are not one of her favorites, get together and look at the comments she gives for each other's briefs! Screw that COC she makes you do. It's upsetting that we have a R&W professor who doesn't give us the respect we all deserve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	1	222548	10/10/07	She went to a fourth tier law school and it shows. Pray you dont get stuck with her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	2	Law		2	5	3	222548	3/21/07	She's tough, but probably the best RW prof at UB. Timely assmt turn-around, helpful comments. Tape her classes - she'll tell you everything to put in the memos and brief, but its so much info you'll miss things.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	1	Law		1	3	3	222548	12/16/05	All R+W professors are wack -- including Laura. She will most likely give you a B (even if you deserve an A).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law	1	1	1	1	222548	11/21/11	She is literally the worst professor I have ever had, and this is from someone who works EXTREMELY hard and spent ENDLESS hours editing, stressing, and working on my papers. If you're a a girl, GOOD LUCK! She has a few key favorites (all male), and the rest it's a crap shoot. If you get her, CHANGE YOUR PROFESSOR.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law	515	3	1	3	222548	6/8/11	Other than bluebook, you will learn nothing from her. Her answers are ambiguous, comments on assignments contradict her in-class instructions, and she blatantly plays favorites. She pushes hard for unpaid clerkships, making it seem as though the employment market is hopeless. I got multiple paid internship offers, without her help!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	2	Law		1	5	3	222548	5/16/09	Class divides on whether she is a good professor with those who do not put in a high level of effort claiming she is a poor professor and those who worked hard claiming she is a good professor. Those who say she picks favorites are full of excuses. I learned a ton, my writing improved tremendously, and she was instrumental in my job search.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	2	Law	515	1	4	4	222548	2/26/08	She covers a lot of ground quickly. If you want to do well you will have to spend a large amount of time writing and revising your work, and you MUST meet with her. If you don't you'll be lost. Most criticism comes from people who procrastinate and then claim that she plays favorites. If you utilize her as a resource, you will do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	3	222548	12/6/07	what a deceptive person. don't let her fool you, she's not nice at all. she has a handful of "favorites" in the class (if you've ever waited in line to speak to her in her office, you can identify the HUGE difference in the way she speaks to her "favorites" and those who are not her favorites.) what a terrible first year professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	5	222548	3/25/07	Teaches 1st year Research&Writing like an advanced level course at Harvard. Both A and B students acknowledge she plays favorites. Record the lectures, because my god does she go quick, and she does not like questions. Overall, I know my writing has positively changed, but it wasn't worth it, and I would definitely NOT take her again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	0	Law		1	1	4	222548	7/30/06	Laura is a nightmare. At first I was fooled by her 'perkiness' and thought she was really down to earth -- then she slowly but steadily became possibly the worst professor I've ever encountered. She is quite the two-faced character. She picks her favorites (god help you if you aren't one of them) and unlike most of the other first year professors
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Laura Reilly	2.4	2	Law		3	5		222548	6/17/03	Ideal first-year professor. Explains legal writing step by step. Gave plenty of feedback on assignments. Made herself available by email anytime. Encouraged us with job searches, and gave career tips. The perkiness was a bonus.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrei Reinhorn	2.1	2	Engineering	324	1	5	5	96277	5/14/06	His class will make you or break you. Like the previous comment, only serious structural engineering students should take his classes.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrei Reinhorn	2.1	0	Engineering	207	3	1		96277	8/7/04	very bad and careless

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrei Reinhorn	2.1	2	Engineering	429	4	4		96277	4/21/04	World class professor. The department is fortunate to have him. A structural P.E. excellent mentor. Work hard in his class and you will do well. If you dont intend to work, take up architecture. This class is for serious engineering students only.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrei Reinhorn	2.1	0	Engineering	207	2	1		96277	12/11/02	He failed a third of our engineering class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Linda Reisman	5.0	2	Film		5	5	5	705244	11/28/05	set in her ways and opinionated, but an amazing resource. Very interested in her work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karol Rejman	4.6	2	Nursing	625	1	5	3	1208457	5/26/11	Dr. Rejman really cares about her students and wants them to do well. She often came in on her own time to do review classes!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karol Rejman	4.6	2	Nursing	560	1	5	3	1208457	8/20/10	Wow! She is an awesome professor and a great preceptor too! She really knows her stuff! she chalenges you to think. She is tough but fair.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karol Rejman	4.6	2	Nursing	505	2	5	3	1208457	1/14/09	AMAZING teacher! The class was not easy, but the professor helped me so much. She really does care about her students. She worked with me whenever I had any questions. She was knowledgeable about everything. Weekly online quizes, challenging but fair if you pay attention in class and do the reading. Definatly recommend this professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Karol Rejman	4.6	2	Nursing	626	1	5	4	1208457	5/26/11	Awesome professor who really cares about her students and wants them to succeed.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	3	3	2	558559	4/13/11	His extra credit policy is great, but his exams are much harder then they need to be. Don't really use the textbook in class, but he pulls questions out of the book that weren't talked about in lecture. No need to really go to class, notes are printed out, just need to read the textbook!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	5	3	4	558559	4/21/09	If you go to class and pay attention it is an easy A. I've heard a few people complain about his German accent, but I barely noticed compared to some of my other professors. He's passionate about what he teaches and always ties things back to he picture. You don't have to learn specifics, just how a systems work which he teaches very well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	0	Geography	101	3	2	1	558559	4/4/09	Really boring. Makes going to lecture nearly impossible. The majority of people in the class do not go to lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	0	Geography	101	1	1	1	558559	11/10/07	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS....if you are looking for an easy gen-ed take nutrition or geology. This class was a nightmare soooo boring, couldn't bring myself to go anymore. Nothing he talked about in class related to the tests.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	475575	3	5	4	558559	11/29/05	Renschler told me I'd have to do absolutely nothing to fail the class. Nice, helpful, availble through email and office hours.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	1	Geography	101	2	3	4	558559	2/15/05	drains the fun out of science. so boring. don't take anything he teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	4	4	4	558559	4/25/10	Earth Systems Science is an introductory class in Geography. This is a seminar class where you will sit in a dark auditorium reviewing powerpoint slides. Christian has a good sense of humor and makes the information as interesting as possible. If you answer a question in class you get an extra credit point. Go to class and you'll do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	5	5	1	558559	4/21/09	definitely cares about the subject. elaborates more than needed with examples. but, definitely go to lecture/reviews and you'll have an A for sure. the subject is terribly boring.. but he tries. his extra credit policy is great.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	3	5	3	558559	4/4/08	Excellent professor. Fully explains everything he teaches. He is approachable and will spend time after class helping you to understand anything you cannot get. A fair grader. I didn't care for the subject before I left, but I am glad I took the course now. He has a passion for what he teaches.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	0	Geography	470	4	1	5	558559	11/30/06	He does try to help students, but he is talks in circles and makes no sense. Examples had no relevance to class. His few lectures were DIRECTLY from the text book. He really gets off easy by having TONS of (mostly bad) speakers and student presentations. He also missed two weeks of class. I did like the final project, loved the due dates, & no exa
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Christian Renschler	3.3	2	Geography	101	4	5	3	558559	5/13/05	He's a good guy- helpful and all. But by the end of the class I couldn't force myself to show up anymore- it was maddeningly boring. Not a horrible class to take though. Moderately difficult but he offers good extra credit opportunities.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	N.S. Revankar	1.0	0	Economics	481	1	1	1	1640963	4/4/12	Sorry but the worst professor I probably had at UB. Stopped going to class 3 weeks in because I didn't learn anything and he didn't follow a set guideline himself. Taught off the top of his head and never used the book which you needed but couldn't even use. No one got an A in his class and the only reason I got a B is I copied and pasted my 2 Exam
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Archie Reyes	4.7	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	5	1623451	1/16/13	He is really good TA. I never meet this kind of TA in my life!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Archie Reyes	4.7	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	4	1623451	8/6/12	Great TA! I want him to be my TA for orgo thi coming fall!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Archie Reyes	4.7	2	Chemistry	101	3	4	2	1623451	12/14/12	Great TA. Tries to keep it simple. The reason I hated the class (not him) is because I had to wake up at 6AM. He's very helpful when it comes to labs. Totally recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	2	284652	4/10/13	Good teacher. Gives a study guide and tells you what is exactly on his exams. 4 exams NO final! gives a lot of extra credit and only a few homework assignments. Very easy going. Easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	5	284652	12/22/12	Great teacher and easy class!! Tests are indeed comprehensive, but doable. He gives lots of opportunity for extra credit. Attendance is good, because his power points are only part way filled in, but once you fill them in, they are extremely helpful for studying. Requires a little bit of work, but it is not hard to get an A. He is a nice guy!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	4	3	3	284652	12/10/12	You will fall asleep in class. Professor reynolds is so boring, and half the time I zoned out although I sill got an A in his class. His tests were pretty easy, & theres lots of opportunity for extra credit so its hard to do bad in the class. I read the text book and did all the practice questions he offered (which were a huge help)Not a bad class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	225	4	4	3	284652	7/10/12	had him for com 225 interpersonal commm and it was a great class. he is a little boring at times but he means well and if u go to office hours regurarly he will help u out and give u a fair grade because he sees u are trying.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	3	284652	1/5/12	got a 78 or 79 on all 4 tests, but still got an A- due to the extra credit offerings which are quick and easy. definitely make sure to do those
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	3	3	3	284652	12/5/11	You have to go to class to get the notes. Definitely use the study guide and practice questions for exams and you will do good. He does not offer ANY feedback on the homeworks so don't bother picking them up. He likes to hear himself talk so lectures are boring...and FYI DO NOT TALK during lecture he gets pissed and its annoying to everyone else.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	1	284652	11/8/11	Extremely boring teacher. However, his material is overall easy, as long as you study from the textbooks. It's still a drag going to lectures and its practically mandatory to go because he occasionally gives in-class assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	3	5	284652	5/12/11	He is a tough teacher to pay attention to. He doesn't make the material exciting. There is a lot of material for a 101 class. With that said, he is very nice and as long as you are aware that it is tough to pay attention, I would reccomend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	4	284652	12/30/10	Not too bad of a class. 4 exams worth 400 pts out of your final grade (600pts). Everyone thinks COM101 is a joke but you need to study for the test, read textbook. Have to do 5 research credits. Gave my class possible 40 pts extra credit. Always helpful when I had questions. TA's are helpful too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	3	284652	12/1/10	A really good prefessor, he is really helpful when it comes to assignments and understanding. he makes the class easy to pass but the exams are very difficult! he gives alot of extra credit work and that is what brings up your score if you do bad on the exams!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	4	3	3	284652	4/4/13	Very easy going class. Lots of oppertunity for extra credit. Exams were not that hard as long as you reviewed the practice questions. Most interesting part of the class is the number of times he said "kind of like" in his lecture. That alone kept me coming back/
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	5	284652	12/20/12	Easy class, just do the test in the back of one of the textbooks before each test. Every question is on the test.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	4	284652	10/1/12	If you go to class and study the notes he puts up you will do just fine. He is very helpful and offers review sessions before each exam. If COM is not something you were interested in you may find the lecture boring, but if you pay attention he goes over the notes very thoroughly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	1	284652	3/1/12	This guy knows his stuff, but he's SUCH a boring lecturer. That said, I found the papers he assigned pretty fun to write, and his TAs aren't tough graders. Study your notes and the book, and you should do alright on the exams. I did so-so on the exams, but great on the papers (and easy group work) which gave me a B+ in the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	5	284652	12/11/11	I'm really surprised so many people found Brian boring. The material in Com101 might be monotonous at times but you can tell Brian is passionate about it. If you have interest in the Communication subject then his examples are cool to listen to. He's not bad at all!! He makes it so easy for students to do well if you show up & pay attention
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	3	284652	12/1/11	Boring professor, but very helpful. If you put his study guides to good use, you can really ace all his exams. Go to class b/c he won't post the full notes online. Class notes & textbook = very useful. I studied the night before for all his exams and passed with an A. He gives you up to 40 extra credit points. Also has random in-class activities.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	4	284652	10/28/11	This man is BOOORRINNNGG. It's very hard to pay attention. However, I got a B+. The material is semi-easy. Just work off the study guides and you'll be okay. He's pretty much the only teacher who teaches this class, so just work through it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	2	4	3	284652	1/10/11	I have heard he is fairly tough on his COM 101 classes. I worked as hard as i possibly could to get perfect grades on my homeworks but found it impossible. The one great thing about this class is that he offers much extra credit. This class was ok. Make sure you study because the tests aren't easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	4	284652	12/11/10	Pretty easy class if you read the textbook. Lectures are quite boring and he also has in class activities that count towards your grade. Gives extra opportunities for extra credit too and gave sweets/candy at the last day/exam.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	2	4	4	284652	11/19/10	I had him for COM101. Not terrible, but he definitely loves to hear the sound of his own voice. Lectures are boring, i spent most of the time on facebook. Attendance isn't mandatory but he does pop assignments every 2-3 weeks where you pretty much get 100 if you're there. tests are pretty hard. memorize the textbook pretty much... average class..
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	3	284652	11/18/10	not a bad guy but loves to hear himself talk. its refreshing that he tries to relate to the class but if often rly awkward comes off as a stand up comedian trying to please the crowd. covers a lot of material and always uses the same buzz words so it all kinda blends together throughout the semester. class was boring i dont remember one thing
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	3	3	2	284652	7/13/10	had him 3 times. he really isnt the best for 101 as he makes it way harder than it needs to be, but there's lots of prime freshman to look at. hes great in the higher level com classes. class is really dull. the 101 text is even more dull. take him for higher levels of com but not 101
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	2	3	1	284652	4/15/10	This is supposed to be com101, not com301. Smart teacher, but there's way too much material at once for a 101 class. I would take the other COM101 professor in a heartbeat. Do not take him if you are taking this class as an elective. Attendance is mandatory, lectures are boring, several essay assignments, but exams are fair. I'd give him a C rating
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	3	284652	4/3/10	class is straightfoward, 4 exams tells u whats on it, minor writing assignments and in class assignments which are very easy, test is mostly base on lecture and a little from the textbook, easy A is you can memorize defintions for the tests
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	202	5	5	5	284652	3/23/10	The best Com prof at UB. Easy grading Lots of extra credit opportunities Very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	4	3	284652	11/7/09	The textbook for this class is a joke. I complete and total joke. Good class though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	4	284652	8/9/09	Class is relaxing and pretty easy. The text was pretty useless, other than the card in the back for research credit. Overall I had fun in his class, he makes it interesting.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	2	284652	4/6/09	Good guy. Easy assignments. Tests not to hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	5	284652	12/13/08	He is really nice teacher. He had a review class when an exam is coming. It is really helpful. Textbook and apply book? are very important!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	5	1	1	284652	12/5/08	First off, if you dont get an A in this class your dumb. All you have to do is go to class for inclass things. Read the sample test questions before the test and read the bolded terms in the book. So pretty much no effort at all besides 2 hours of studying for each test. Plus lots of extra credit. I had over a 100 in the class...simple
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	3	284652	8/2/10	One of my favorite profs I've had here. always kept things interesting and related to real life. Helpful if you need to talk to him, but be sure you show to class and do the work (which there is a decent amount of). Gives some extra credit if you miss something also, which is a plus. Study guides, review sessions as well. Hope to take him again.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	3	1	284652	4/23/10	For being a communication professor I would think his communication skills would be better. I once counted him saying "kind of" 195 times in one 50 minute lecture! He tries to make comm seem way more important than it is!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	4	284652	4/13/10	I like Brian. He's a good lecturer, but the material he's teaching is a little boring. He writes the textbook, so if you pay attention in lecture, you shouldn't have to read very often.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	217	5	3	3	284652	3/25/10	Brian is one of the nicest professors at UB. He grades fairly and his tests are straightforward - he always provides a study guide which is exactly what will be on the test. The only reserve I have with him is that he can be extremely hard to follow in class. It could just be the material, but it is so dull and boring in class. Good guy/tad boring.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	5	284652	1/12/10	Brian is the man! The class itself is pretty easy; you have to try to get a poor grade. The class material is in the book exactly, but some extra chapters in the book are also covered on the test. He throws out a lot of concepts that can be mixed up, but he is the most helpful, understanding person around. Great Class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	1	284652	10/19/09	Easy class. Random days there is an in-class activity. Tests are easy and most questions come directly from practice exams in back of book. Lectures aren't bad at all either. Easy A if you have any intelligence at all...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	4	284652	7/25/09	Easy class, simple concepts. Only problem is that he doesn't have high enough standards of behavior...I swear, sometimes it felt like I was sitting in a middle school class w/ the girls in the back chit-chatting. Attend lectures, read books, do practice problems and go to review sessions and you're golden!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	3	284652	12/20/08	BJ is the man. all the test questions are the examples from the textbook. just make sure you do the assignments because they will DEFINITELY improve your grade, even if you do bad on them. the way his grading system works is like adding up all the points for a total, so even though i only got 15/20 on most of them, i ended up getting an A!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	1	284652	12/7/08	Good professor, and good guy. Very helpful if you have questions, or need help with something. Class is 4 tests, in class assignments and some homework papers. Not an interesting subject, but fairly easy class, with extra credit.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	225	2	4	5	284652	8/26/08	i enjoy him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	4	284652	6/18/08	Interesting guy- he likes to move around a lot while he teaches, not a bad class, and it helps to read.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	2	284652	4/28/08	Good professor and all around good guy. One of the most helpful professors I've ever had. Goes out of his way to make himself available to students. Going to class will help you get better grades- wish I would have gone more. 4 multiple choice exams, a few short papers and some in-class activities. Not the most interesting class, but not bad.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	217	5	5	3	284652	10/14/07	i took com101 and 217 with reynolds, he's an awesome professor inside and outside of the classroom. he's helpful and has great advice with what courses and professors to take. i will be taking com202 with him next semester, he's new with the course, but he said he'll make it fun for a night class! take any courses you can with reynolds!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	217	5	5	3	284652	9/5/07	Go to class and your life will be easier. Good guy too.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	5	284652	5/17/07	If you fail or get a poor grade it is your own fault.. Great teacher, teaches it in an easy manner and its easy to understand.... Gives easy assignments and extra credit so you pass.. Tests are easy but GO TO CLASS you will get bonuses and make sure you read the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	217	4	5	1	284652	5/10/07	His test are a little tedious but over all an easy teacher. Very cool guy and fair; always willing to listen and help. TAKE HIM IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE COM 217
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	3	284652	1/22/07	Very enjoyable. He gives so much extra credit, you always have an oppurtunity to get an A, even if you bomb an exam. He's very smart and knows his stuff but you gotta be able to focus or you'll get lost in the lecture. If you go to every class, its hard not to do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	4	284652	12/30/06	a good teacher and easy clas.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	3	1	1	284652	12/5/06	this class made me wanna shoot myself. worst professor ever. do not take com 101...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	2	284652	11/15/06	great teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	2	4	2	284652	5/13/08	Even though I did lots of extra credit and scored at class average I still received a C- in the course.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	4	284652	1/20/08	Consider your self lucky to have Brian Reynolds as a professor- He actually cares that you learn, not just memorize senseless sh*t.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	325	3	4	4	284652	10/4/07	This class is pretty basic in general, but he's a good guy and he made things interesting. Very open, lets students do pretty much whatever they want for topics. I had him for 101 too. Overall, def. a good teacher, I've had way worse. take him, he's cool.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	4	284652	9/5/07	He can talk and talk and talk till you fall asleep, but, he does his job well and is very nice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	2	4	1	284652	5/16/07	Basically if you go to class, read and study the study guide you should be good. I thought it was going to be an easy A but it took a little bit of effort. Hes a pain when it comes to grading those stupid assignments, he'll kill himself before he gives someone full credit so dont even try
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	3	4	284652	5/9/07	GO TO CLASS YOU, HE SOMETIMES GIVES RESEARCH CREDIT JUST BECAUSE STUDY THE SMALLER TEXTBOOK FOR EACH CHAPTER FOR THE TEST ALL OF THE QUESTIONS APPEAR ON THE EXAM
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	3	284652	1/7/07	Boring
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	1	284652	12/11/06	he's a good teacher. COM101 is psychology101 all over again. very dry and confusing course that goes no where. his TA's are horrible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	3	284652	12/1/06	Really great teacher, alot of information
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	4	284652	11/11/06	Really nice, helpful, easy-going.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	1	1	1	284652	8/28/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	3	5	284652	7/10/06	You basically take notes the entire class. Nice guy but quite boring most of the time. He has a sense of humor, but he won't crack jokes too often. Kinda of a slacker prof. imo. Make sure to study the practice questions in the "Applying" book for tests. And show up to all classes, sign his paper, and stay till end of class or you'll be sorry.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	4	3	3	284652	5/4/06	Boring lectures, but the class is relatively easy. Just make sure to show up, because there are a lot of in-class assignments that count heavily towards final grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	5	3	3	284652	4/11/06	easy class but boring. a lot of this stuff is common sense. exams are also really easy
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	3	1	5	284652	11/15/05	boring and dry much like ben stein
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	5	284652	11/4/05	Prof. Reynolds may be a bit boring at times, but he's really responsive to the needs of students. He accepted one of my assignments late with no penalty and was very understanding. Show up to class, do a little reading, and the application assignments and you're all set.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	3	3	3	284652	10/21/05	If I hear about his damn wife and their trip to Hawaii again, I'm going to resign feeling like I accomplished something.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101225	5	3	2	284652	10/4/05	You could sleep through his classes and still pass. It's all common sense; most of the com department is. His lectures are a little dry/boring but he only makes you take a few tests and in 101 write 2 simple papers. It's beyond easy. I can't imagine that even the worlds best professor could make that material interesting, it's not his fault.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	5	2	4	284652	9/23/05	Its not so good
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	3	284652	9/5/05	I thought this class was xtremely easy. Those who have any bad thing to say about brian probably didn't do so well in his class..he's not the most interesting instructor in the world, but if you write good notes, and go to talk to him, you'll be okay.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	2	284652	8/22/06	Go to class and you will do fine, he is a very boring professor but an over all nice guy who allows for plenty research ops. through out the course.. keep up with the readings and classes and its sure to be an easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	4	284652	5/7/06	Nice guy, lecture was a little dull but overall it was fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	5	4	284652	4/16/06	Just do your work. The class is a breeze...its impossible to get lower than a B
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	4	1	284652	12/9/05	Prof Reynolds is easy. If you're interested in comm, then he can make it less interesting at times, but if you do the application assignments and cram for the tests, he is a very easy grader and you should do well. Lecture is boring but if you don't go you can miss assignments-- just remember you can make up missed assignments (just email a TA).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	4	4	284652	11/8/05	Tho his class is boring. Mistakes in his workbook. Somehow. I still think that he's a good lecturer. He responded my email in time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	4	1	2	284652	10/28/05	Reynolds is worthless, don't expect him to answer his email or be of much help at all. Avoid at all costs, this guy cost me a D grade on my transcript because he didn't bother grade an assignment that he agreed to take late. Anyone with intelligence should avoid this teacher like the plague, he is whiny, boring and belongs in high school.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	225	4	5	4	284652	9/30/05	decent professor. exams are fair but he makes it hard NOT to get an A in the class with the extra credit & particpation activites. easy A if you glance over notes for exams and go to class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5	3	284652	9/12/05	:)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	4	3	1	284652	9/3/05	Very boring, however, he's an easy A. His lectures are straight from the book.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101225	4	4	3	284652	8/27/05	had him for both classes in the same semester, back to back. he repeated himself so much but that`s expected with the material. VERY EASY A. pretty easy exams. very helpful. can be boring but sometimes funny. definitely take him for any COM classes
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	225	4	4	4	284652	5/5/05	The class overall is easy. Just read the lecture notes and do all the research/participation credits and you're guaranteed an A. Brian tries hard and I think he's s good teacher. Some people just don't want to learn. But YES I would recommend him as a teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	3	1	4	284652	4/27/05	He is a communication professor...who can't communicate. His lectures are boring as all **** and really, he just doesn't belong in a teaching position. Avoid AT ALL COSTS.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	4	2	284652	12/28/04	This guy is pretty cool. I agree with the comments about his different positions he puts his body in while lecturing. He should take that to the extreme and climb up on a ladder or a piano while he discusses academic dishonesty. Easy material. Easy Tests. Easy Papers. Comm is a worthless degree
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	3	3	284652	12/13/04	He is a great teacher, even though the subject is very boring, he makes it very simple and the tests are easy. i'm taking another class with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4	3	284652	11/7/04	He's a fairly easy teacher. Test are directly from powerpoints. Makes you buy Readings in Communication book and test you on it. I hate the book, it's a waste of time and $48.50 but is a requirement. You need to buy your own because of a research sheet in the book. So it's inevitable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	2	2	4	284652	10/16/04	I fall asleep every class. Help me please! And his tests aren't that easy- I got a C, but maybe cuz I'm always sleeping.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	4	4		284652	4/26/04	Ok so he's boring and says "right" after every sentence and it drives you nuts, but the class and tests are easy if you go and take the notes everday. It's not horrible, but not interesting either.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	4	2		284652	4/13/04	his class is boring but it is easy to do well in his class. lots of extra cred n tests are easy. he takes attendance at least once a week but it doesnt really count.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	2	4		284652	4/5/04	I think that your class is very boring, but I like when we watch movies...like Bend it like Beckham.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	225	5	3	3	284652	5/7/05	BORING BORING BORING but easy A and easy exams
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	4	1	3	284652	5/4/05	Brian is the worst professor I have ever had. He is an awful speaker, and the most annoying person I have ever had to listen to. It's very ironic that Brian teaches communication, because it is absolutely terrible at communicating. Whatever you do, do not take a class with reynolds. He is bad!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	5	3	3	284652	1/19/05	this guy is a dork, he means well, but he's just a dork, and the subject matter he teaches is so simple and self explanitory a monkey could teach it. I agree, he should be a high school teacher. Whatever, it's an easy A if you go to class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	4	1	1	284652	12/22/04	Worthless idiot. Too stupid to be a college professor, belongs in high school or maybe even middle school. Never responds to emails. Avoid at all costs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5	2	284652	11/20/04	well,he takes attendance in class which sucks, and his tests are really hard, which sucks, BUT the papers are soo easy- which is amazing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	4	4	284652	10/18/04	Great teacher..keeps it simple and laid-back, while teaching effectively as well. The tests are really easy, which is great now, but they might be a little too easy, which might not prepare us for other comm classes as much as it should.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	5	5		284652	5/5/04	His class gets a bit boring, and yes his positions he sits in are rather amusing, not to mention he says RIGHT after everything. BUT, his tests are very easy, fair grader, lots of bonus opportunities. Attendance tho which sucks
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	2	Communication	101	3	5		284652	4/23/04	ugh, he should be a highschool teacher
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	1	Communication	101	4	3		284652	4/9/04	Boring, dry, tests and curves are pretty good. The review is whack. I went from C to an A-. Easy class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	101	1	1		284652	4/1/04	COM 101 is never a good idea!!!! Do NOT take this professor!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Brian Reynolds	3.8	0	Communication	225	1	1		284652	12/12/03	terrible
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cheul Rhee	2.7	2	Management	404	2	5	2	1195404	1/3/09	I really wonder why he has so many enemies... :-) To me, he was one of the best professors. His English is a little bit weird, but there was no prob in understanding. I learned a lot from him, and I decided to go to graduate school to further study DB because of him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cheul Rhee	2.7	1	Management	404	3	3	3	1195404	11/2/08	Prepare to be really confused. Has a hard time keeping the class in check because everyone is frustrated with his teaching ability. He's generally a nice guy though, willing to help out when he can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Cheul Rhee	2.7	0	Management	404	3	1	3	1195404	12/29/08	To me, this class was waste of time. His English is hard to understand and, more decisively, it seems he does not know his matarials at all; I doubt he really knows what the database stands for.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Byron Rich	4.6	1	Fine Arts	210	3	3	3	1734090	12/31/12	he is okay. smart but too demanding but at the same time understanding.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Byron Rich	4.6	2	Fine Arts	210	4	5	5	1734090	12/11/12	Literally the coolest dude on the planet. He knows his stuff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Byron Rich	4.6	2	Fine Arts	210	3	5	4	1734090	7/10/12	This dude is the man
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Byron Rich	4.6	2	Fine Arts	210	4	5	4	1734090	12/21/12	Honestly, he's the best instructor I've had at UB so far. Definitely a great person to learn from.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Byron Rich	4.6	2	Fine Arts	210	4	5	4	1734090	9/4/12	He is definitely a great teacher. He explained everything he wants in each project very clearly, and he gave out many "good" comments which made me feel good!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	201	4	3	2	1594563	1/14/13	Really nice and easy. There are barely any assignments during the year and everything leads up to the final project. I got an easy A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	101	5	5	4	1594563	5/25/12	Great class! Rhonda is a sweet teacher and really cares about her students. You feel like you are in grade school again, with a caring teacher. The only problem is that you won't learn anything. If you are looking for an easy A and caring, sweet teacher take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	101	5	4	1	1594563	1/23/12	shes super kind and is your typical touchy feely english teacher. she really tries hard to make the classroom as comfortable a place for everyone . a good choice for an english teacher if you arent an english major. easy A. also she looks like she was extremely hot as a younger woman. just throwing it out there.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	101	5	5	3	1594563	11/29/11	Don't listen to those other reviews. I had her for 101 and 102 last year. She's a great lady, easy to understand, and really nice. The class is super easy and she gives good feedback. Definitely a great teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	201	5	5	4	1594563	9/15/11	This prof is by far the best English prof. at UB. She does not require as much as the other profs and she is also a happy + fun person to be around.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	201	3	4	1	1594563	12/18/12	She's such a sweet lady and her class doesn't require a lot of effort.. Just one 12 page paper. Really easy to work with! I highly recommend taking her class
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	2	English	101	4	5	4	1594563	5/2/12	She is very willing to help students and it is a fun class overall! You will learn you think differently about an idea.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	0	English	101	5	1	3	1594563	12/22/11	She is an easy professor but you will NOT learn anything. She is also a pushover and, overall, a pretty easy grader. Only take her if you're looking to have an easy pass, not learn. I SECOND THIS!!!!!! You can't get a better summery of her as a teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	0	English	102	4	2	3	1594563	11/8/11	She is an easy professor but you will NOT learn anything. She is also a pushover and, overall, a pretty easy grader. Only take her if you're looking to have an easy pass, not learn.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rhonda Reid	3.5	0	English	101	5	1	5	1594563	6/27/11	This teacher grades you on how much she likes your personality. I've been told she was appointed to the job by her husband, who happens to be the director of English. A.K.A You can't report her for being a crappy teacher since she's married to the man you must report her to. The whole english department is this way. I got out ASAP.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	1	Mathematics	309	3	3	3	500632	12/6/12	Had 3 exams worth 25 percent each, and weekly quizzes done in recitation that the average was given a weight of 25 percent. Homework from the book is highly recommended. The worst thing about him is that he takes points off if you have extraneous work or it seems when he just feels like it. Its very hard to read off the board in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	311	3	5	4	500632	12/29/11	Quite a good professor. Answers questions very clearly. Mandatory recitation: first half is used to go over homework (TA does problems on board), second half is used to take a quiz (usually fairly simple). 3 tests, no final, need ~85% on tests for an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	311	3	4	4	500632	4/24/11	Nice guy, though kinda cynical at times. Definitely the better of the two professors of this class from what I hear. The material is somewhat difficult, and he makes it easier to understand. Homeworks are challenging, as are the quizzes, but the tests are fairly easy. If you're taking 311, get him as your teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	0	Mathematics	141	1	1	3	500632	9/7/10	James Reineck is far from my opinion of a good professor. He stands at the board and does not turn to look at the class. He talks into the board while writing everything at a fast pase. He doesnt stop for anything and just keeps going and assumes we know what he is talking about.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	311	2	5	3	500632	4/4/07	Difficult course. He explains the material fairly well, but sometimes goes too quickly through some proofs and assumes we know how to do them. Lots of homework, but the quizes and exams are fair. Very nice guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	309	5	5	3	500632	4/21/05	Awesome professor. Clear presentation of material. Tests are fair. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	558	4	5	4	500632	3/5/12	Great professor. Speaks English (a big plus). Homework is quite challenging, and worth half your grade, but is willing to help during office hours. Exams are easier than homework. Curve given at the end is nice. Overall a fun class to attend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	311	3	4	4	500632	12/22/11	The course material is quite challeging and the homeworks are very difficult. The exams are fair though and he is a generous grader. Definitely the better of the two professors for the course from what I have heard. Make sure you go to class even though attendance isn't mandatory it helps.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	311	3	5	5	500632	4/13/11	Take his class, the class material is quite difficult, a quiz every week, tests are fair, As long as you spend enough time to do the homework, you will be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	458	3	3	4	500632	12/7/07	Overall great professor with slightly cynical sense of humor. 400 points consisting of 200 points for 5 homework assignments and 100 points each for two exams (calculator, 3x5 note card allowed). Homework can be difficult, the exams are fair, and the grading scale is generous.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	306	4	4	3	500632	10/26/05	Knows material very well, and explains it in reasonable terms. Enjoyable personality (if you can see it). Strict no-talking in class policy. Very good teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	James Reineck	4.0	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	3	500632	11/30/04	very clear, you will do good by going to class, and taking notes. great teacher and knows what he is talking about. if you do bad in the class, math is not for you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	1	Law	623	3	3	4	610691	12/27/12	I've taken three classes with Prof. Reis and I can say that he's a very nice and knowledgeable person. He will make time for you if you have reasonable and intelligent questions. If you work hard and don't expect to be spoonfed the materials, you will do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law	703	3	1	3	610691	7/23/09	Well he is completely unclear which is fine up to a point. That point was the final paper. Its hard to follow the guidelines required for a good grade when there are none. Taking his class is Russian Roulette.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law	696	4	1	3	610691	2/21/09	Very unclear and very tough to follow in class. Reading the assignments did nothing for class discussion because he just rambles. I did very well in the class, but Im not sure I actually learned anything from the class. You have to balance an easy teacher vs. someone who actually gets you to learn. I got an A- but I doubt I learned much IP.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law		2	1	3	610691	7/23/07	Unhelpful in every way: directionless, devoid of clarity, and completely unresponsive outside of class. Stay away.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law	2	5	1	3	610691	5/2/05	Very unclear, very unhelpful, waste of a class. His son was in my class and he NEVER showed up, but managed to get an A. Nice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law		3	1	5	610691	12/10/10	I disregarded the other posts when I signed up for this class. This was a mistake. Head the warnings! Your interest in the topic is not worth dealing with this clown. Go buy a book, take a webinar- do anything but take this class. He may be the worst professor at UB Law.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law	3	3	1	4	610691	5/12/09	I'd rather be waterboarded for 12 -14 weeks than take another class with this professor. (Commercial Real Estate Transactions). He has no desire to teach and it shows.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law	2	1	1	5	610691	12/17/08	I worked in real estate for years before coming to law school. I did not do well in this class. I absolutely have to agree with the other posters. STAY AWAY. DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANYTHING. It's a shame, because he's the only one that teaches any of the upper-level property classes at UB.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Reis	1.2	0	Law		3	1	1	610691	8/31/05	He is arrogant and not very helpful. Do not take his class. It is a waste of time.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	408	4	5	5	999208	4/10/13	She is a nice lady ! esay class, go to the class, do the homework. learn a lot
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	407	5	4	5	999208	11/9/10	She's really nice and it's easy to get high grade from her class. She just made me love writing. She's a really good person btw.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	408	4	5	4	999208	3/24/08	great english teacher.very very helpful and lenient. if you have a toefl score of about 250 to 300, i suggest you not take her class. plenty of essays and a lot of drafts. but if you do everything and attend classes, its an easy A
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	407	5	3	3	999208	1/23/12	bascially, she is a good teacher, it is an easy A, as long as you go class, do homework, but i don't really feel learn a lot,( but of course have learned something, )i guess esl classes are all like this. she is not a bad choice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	408	3	5	2	999208	6/17/08	she's a very good teacher and it will be easy A !!! 408 itself is very hard because you have to write plenty of essays to pass this course. however, Mrs. Reitan always tries to make it easy to approach. I really recommend her for you guys :))) GOOD LUCK.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Kirsten Reitan	4.8	2	English	407	5	5	5	999208	6/5/07	She is very nice and helpful.She can explain English grammar clearly. You should keep working in order to get A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Rembis	5.0	2	History		4	5	4	1585747	11/17/11	Never had class with him, but all of my friends wont shut up about how amazing he is. That and I do know he is a very friendly guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Michael Rembis	5.0	2	History	348	4	5	4	1585747	5/26/11	Michael was great. Extremely knowledgeable and just a remarkable person. Excellent addition to the staff.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Louis Rera	5.0	2	Fine Arts	105	5	5	3	772367	12/6/05	The cutest man ever, really fair grader with easy assignments...if you need help he'll go out of his way to help you and get you anything you need. very smart and possibly the best prof in the art dept!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Nagesh Revankar	1.0	0	Economics	581	2	1	2	1587419	11/9/11	Professor Revankar is completely unable to relate with his students. He scribbles on the board from memory and fails his arms around for theatrical effect. His HW/Tests are suffer a disconnect from the textbook he recommends. Take this class with Shang and avoid Revankar like the plague.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miguel Reyes-Mariano	4.4	2	Languages	154	2	5	3	519518	3/8/08	He's a very nice guy. He wants you do your homework everyday though!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miguel Reyes-Mariano	4.4	2	Languages	152	3	4	4	519518	5/23/05	good guy, very nice. sorta hard to understand because he speaks all in spanish, but you get used to it. if you go to class and do your work, you'll be fine
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miguel Reyes-Mariano	4.4	2	Languages	152	2	5	5	519518	2/6/07	Nice teacher, good looking, he pretends to be tough but he helps you all the way
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Miguel Reyes-Mariano	4.4	2	Languages	151152	4	4	4	519518	4/20/05	well he speaks in all spanish, but if u've had spanish before, you should do wel. he's really nice and personable, u'll do well if you do the homequizzes and homework
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sean Reynolds	4.8	2	English	201	4	5	4	1280957	12/21/10	He made class interesting. His sense of humor made class enjoyable. Your grade is based on a few essays and a final research paper. He allows revisions which raise your grade at least one letter grade. This class allowed me to think in different ways because he combines writing with philisophers. I would reccomend his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sean Reynolds	4.8	2	English	102	3	5	2	1280957	12/9/09	English is usually boring and what not, but Reynolds made it fun. He's a funny guy and at 8a.m. his humor was much needed. Also, if anything is ever unclear he'll set you straight on what's to be handed in or completed. Always available through e-mail as well. Boring class, not too hard, attendance is important however. Recommend him for ENG102.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sean Reynolds	4.8	2	English	102	2	5	1	1280957	5/3/10	One of the best teachers Ive ever had. He has a very dry sense of humor, and it's hilarious. I went into this class thinking I didn't need to learn anything, but I was wrong. Even if I didn't learn anything new about English, he did get me to think in ways I have never thought before. Very helpful and always available to help. Highly recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sean Reynolds	4.8	2	English	201	3	5	1	1280957	5/4/09	I hated english but this class was probably one of my favorites! There is no textbook just a small guideline handbook that was cheap. There were three major papers but you have to hand in at least two rough drafts before the final and Sean is always willing to provide extra help if needed. Class was always fun too. Highly recommend this class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	202	5	5	5	1032396	1/31/13	Awesome Teacher! nice person and helpful.. Listen to her, do the homework, u'll be fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	201	3	2	3	1032396	12/23/12	orgo is a difficult class no matter who you take. Dr. Riaz made the exams extremely fair and gives bonus on them too. She offers help sessions on saturdays and goes over problems that are sometimes on the test. I would definitely take Riaz if u want a good grade
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	201	3	5	4	1032396	12/11/12	Dr Riaz is one of the most helpful chem professors at UB> Ochem is tough, but if you go to office hrs and make a point of learning your material, you will appreciate her thorough understanding of the subject and her willingness to help you get the best grade you work for.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	221	4	5	3	1032396	7/1/12	I took this class over the summer at ECC with Dr. Riaz. Organic Chemistry could not get much easier than having her as a professor. Very helpful, will do anything to help you out with problems, and is very clear on what will be on exams. Highly recommend her if you want a good grade in this difficult college course. She makes the exams passible
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	1	Chemistry	201	2	3	3	1032396	10/28/11	Not worth it to ask for help. She thinks you are just "unprepared" or "lazy" I am neither. I have a's & b's in every other science course but she is intolerable. Never, ever take a course with her!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	1	Chemistry	201	2	4	3	1032396	8/30/10	Took her over the summer for chem 201. She is not the easiest to understand but she does try and help. Read the book before lecture and do lots of practice problems. This class is hard but she is there to help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	202	4	5	2	1032396	5/10/10	She is probably the most caring professor that i had ever had. Attendance is mandatory because she has 5 problem of date session in which you just have to copy down the thing she wrote on the power point and get 10 points for each problem session. Lots of bonus points. But she go too fast during the lecture, so you have to read it your self.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	1	Chemistry	102	2	4	4	1032396	5/17/09	Riaz, has an indian accent, its strong, but not so strong, that is 100% incomprehensible. She is extrememly helpful, and wants everyone to learn, and pass. I wen to the chem help center NSC 110, and i saw personaly helping out a student. Chemistry 102, seems a lot harder than che 101, and the test grade compared to last years 102 class is much lowe
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	102	4	5	5	1032396	4/24/09	She is a really good professor. Although her accent is sometimes difficult to understand but her exams are really good.She gives practice exam before the exam. If you will do it with clarity your A is not far. we do have to put ourselves into the course but if we work hard, it is easy. She is a nice person too./ Always ready to help you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	201	1	1	1	1032396	4/22/09	This was the worst class I have ever taken. The second exam average was a 44%.... DO NOT TAKE RIAZ AT ALL COSTS!!! If you are forced to take her class don't take 2 gen eds instead.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	201	4	5	4	1032396	12/30/12	Look orgo is difficult and there is a lot to cover so it will go fast. She has review sessions every week plus an extended officer hour the day of the test. Not to mention her practice exams meant there were very little surprises on the test, She was very nice and approachable. Getting an at least decent grade was not terribly difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	201	3	5	5	1032396	12/14/12	Organic chemistry is a hard subject regardless of the professor, and Dr. Riaz did a great job explaining everything, and her tests were very reasonable. She seems a little intimidating at first, but go to her office hours and she is more than willing to help you however she can. She did a great job.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	201	4	5	4	1032396	12/4/12	One of the best orgo professors at ub. Very clear in what she wants and if you do what she tells you, you will get a good grade. Makes orgo really simple. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	201	2	5	1	1032396	11/3/11	I took her class at ECC.Organic can be a nightmare class if you don't work Hard.She was extremely helpful to me.She is only mean to students who are careless and do not put in the hard work or don't come to class on time.I worked extremely hard and got a B. She comforted me when I panicked about my grade before final. I transferred co'z of her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	201	2	1	3	1032396	10/30/10	Do not let her know who you are. If you go to her office hours to ask questions she will talk to you like you're stupid and tell you that you probably don't attend any lectures (I didn't miss one) and thats why you have questions. If she misgrades a test & you bring it for corrections she will go through it again to try to take off points elsewhere
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	202	2	5	5	1032396	5/14/10	Uzma is in all honesty one of the nicest teachers I've ever had. Organic Chemistry is a strenuous class but she does her best. Goes out of her way to help in any way she can. Reading the book will go a long way in this class. I never paid attention in class but read every page of the book and got an A. Organic is a killer, take it seriously
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	202	2	1	2	1032396	4/8/10	Literally the WORST professor I've had in college. This woman does not know how to teach a college course. She flips through slides too fast for you to read them, let alone write anything down. Doesn't know how to hand back papers. If you are forced to take her, going to lecture is pretty much useless, just read the textbook and you'll do okay.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	1	5	1032396	4/28/09	avoid riaz at all cost. her accent is horrible and her power points are horrible. the tests are super hard. questions will show up that you have never seen or gone over before.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	1	1	1032396	4/22/09	HORRIBLE! DO NOT TAKE RIAZ IF YOU CAN HELP IT. If you get her I would suggest putting off chemistry until a later time. Can't understand her and shes a horrible teacher. Her powerpoints are basically the text book in a bulleted format. Completely useless to even go to lecture. The only reason I may pass this course is because I have an awesome TA.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	2	2	1032396	4/20/09	Worst teacher I have ever had. So difficult to understand. With all the time I try and pay attention to try and understand what she says I lose time actually trying to understand the notes. I would highly recommend you going to another professors class and not her lecture. Do the HW that is what will help you pass, along with your TAs help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	1	Chemistry	102	2	4	3	1032396	4/14/09	very nice teacher. although many dont want to, it really helps to attend the lectures. after you attend them for about two weeks, it is easy to comprehend her accent. reviews a lot for quizzes and exams during lecture too. very approachable for any questions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	112	1	1	1	1032396	3/17/09	I strongly recommend NOT taking this woman's class. She is basically useless. It is pointless to attend lecture because she does not speak english very well, or at all really, and reads straight off the powerpoint that she gets straight from the book. If this is the only lecture you can register for, just go to someone else's lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	3	1	4	1032396	2/3/09	Do not get this professor. Avoid having her at all costs. She just reads off the slides and it is impossible to understand what she is saying though that thick accent.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	3	1	3	1032396	1/20/09	Well, all I have to say is that after just 1 lecture, I know to skip this class and use all the at home resources to teach myself, which there are a lot of. Do not take her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	1	Chemistry	102	3	3	1	1032396	1/13/09	um just had my 1st class with her today...she tells us to not use phones/do other hw/read newspaper cuz it takes away from the focus of the material..well the only thing i was concentrating on was trying to understand what she was saying!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	2	Chemistry	102	4	5	3	1032396	11/9/08	Professor Riaz, though somewhat hard to understand, is the most helpful professor I have ever had. She makes a practice exam for you and reviews it for two lectures before the exam. If you don't get an A in this class you must not be trying
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	1	1	2	1032396	5/23/08	I took chemistry for engineers with her. No lie, THE WORST teacher I ever had. I had taken chemistry during my junior year and got a 87 overall. I had to resign the class toward the beginning of the semester. I knew people that were better at Chem than me and still got C's. Just don't take her class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	3	2	2	1032396	9/26/07	Great teacher if you like not using al the consanents in words or conjunctions. Should be deported back to Inda/Germany. Reads right off of a powerpoint and is very inept when it comes to explainng anything. Not sure how eassy or not it is but we shall soon see. PS very contradictory ALL THE TIME!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	1	1	3	1032396	3/31/09	Horrible prof. Chem was my favorite science in highschool. But then I had her. No idea how I got the grade I did. Her slides didn't pertain to what was on the test very often. Just used powerpoints.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	1	1	1032396	3/4/09	Do not take this professor. Slept through most of the lectures and the ones I attended were useless. The accent is bad, yes, but what makes it worse is her reading off the slides with no examples. To add to that, she skips slides and tells students to learn them themselves. Why come to lecture then? I was honestly more confused when I left lecture.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	1	1	1032396	1/22/09	By the beard of zeus I have a better chance of running a 3 minute mile then actually passing class. She managed to ruin everything that I loved about Chemistry. I would rather listen to fran drescher or nails on a chalkboard. All though she is extremely attractive in a hindu sort of way, you will fail, guarenteed.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	102	1	2	1	1032396	1/16/09	One of the worst teachers Ive ever had for any course- ya she gives you a practice exam, but while she goes over it she makes errors students gotta point out, then tells you to figure it out later. Tells you things to focus on for test which never even appeared on test. Practice exams were not even close to being similiar as normal test.shes awful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	3	2	2	1032396	12/15/08	I couldn't understand her at all and fell asleep during every class, so I skipped the last 3/4 of the semester. I learned everything from reading the chapters in the book. Avoid this teacher. Luckily I ended up getting an A, no thanks to her.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	2	1	1	1032396	6/5/08	SUCKS NEVER TAKE HER. you cant understand a word out of her mouth
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Uzma Riaz	2.5	0	Chemistry	107	1	2	1	1032396	1/16/08	has a deep indian accent to the point that it is not comprehensive to the ear.. useless going to lecture since she lectures right off the powerpoint which is long as heck (and availible for d/l on ublearns) review doesnt even help since i study my butt off and only manage a C-. dont recommend taking this prof
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	1	Engineering	209	2	3	5	468117	8/8/12	One of the best prof's at SUNY Buffalo (at least for engineering) He is not easy; but that is the point. Generally, if you do not do well in his class it would be in your best interest to search for a new major.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	2	2	468117	8/5/10	talked in the mic,kinda also coughed in it. only 20 kids attended. took him 2x but ended up with another prof and passed. i wouldn't recommend him to anyone. go to the other professor he makes the class easier and doesn't expect you to be perfect like richards
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	208	2	2	2	468117	3/31/10	Not the greatest prof in the world. Definitely get ready to teach yourself for the most part. Hard to hear him clearly in class and he doesn't really explain topics.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	209	1	1	4	468117	8/30/09	worst professor imaginable! hard to understand and hear. does not explain concepts as the book does. uncaring and condescending. tests are extremely difficult. had him for both statics and mechs....at least i know i can pass anything engineering throws at me now.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	2	2	5	468117	12/17/08	Actually, not a very nice person. There were 100 students in the section. About 8 regularly attended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	1	Engineering	207	3	4	3	468117	11/13/08	Very helpful if you go to his office hours at the right time. Does not speak loudly and hate using a mic. Puts up overheads with photocopies of example question on textbooks(not the one we're using) without magnifying the font. I was on the first row and can't see the words on the overhead projector.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	2	Engineering	209	4	5	3	468117	1/16/08	extremely helpfull, all you have to do is ask him a question or go to see him in office and he spends endless amounts of time to those interested. he also actually makes you think and not memorize certain problems.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	1	1	468117	5/8/07	Should not be a professor. Can't hear him talk, has used the same hard to read overheads for the last 50 years. Expects perfection on his hard exams and grades unfairly. Against all technology (computers/email). Lots of homework that hardly counts. Averages are about 25% on tests. Worst class and professor I have ever taken, PERIOD!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	3	3	5	468117	2/14/06	hard to hear in the lecture hall, the only time you can hear him is when he coughs or mumbles. His overheads are hard to see. If there is another professor available to teach EAS207, that one would probably be best
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	1	Engineering	207	5	3	3	468117	10/26/05	Don't go to him with trivial questions. Sometimes seems like a confused old man, but he has a vast knowledge of engineering and philisophy. Some insightful lectures when he deviates from the "course description" i.e. talks about "how they used to do it" or occasionally talks about tensors, general relativity stuff. Statics is really below him...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	2	Engineering	437	3	3	4	468117	3/30/12	Good teacher if you attend class and complete the homework assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	2	Engineering	207	4	3	4	468117	4/9/10	Very old and LOVES going off on tangents.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	2	Engineering	209	3	5	4	468117	12/22/09	Definitely one of the best professors at the University. Lazy people who don't go to class and do not want to think will hate him. He purposely engineers his course against such people. He is the only professor I have had so far who seems to be profoundly interested in reality.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	209	2	2	4	468117	3/17/09	horrible professor. self-interested. little to no teaching skills.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	209	4	2	3	468117	11/25/08	Very knowledgeable but with ZERO... or below zero teaching capacity. Cannot hear, does not speak loud enough, does not listen, very condesending, does not follow text, ~9 hours homework per week, dives into topics without EXPLAINING, ZERO use of computer/web/technology. PREPARE TO TEACH YOURSELF, if so tests easy but always too long, avg is ~25%
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	2	2	468117	4/18/08	Would not take a class with him if someone put a gun to my head!!!:-)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	1	1	468117	1/7/08	worst prof i have come across
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	2	2	468117	4/30/07	hard to hear, slides are hard to see and old. tests are much harder than homework given. book didn't help much either. hes an old man who coughs and does mumble. take another professor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	3	3	468117	11/29/05	he is a nice guy but he's a really old man who seems like he should have died years ago. the class is really really hard and his lectures are really boring and aren't clear. tests are really really hard and are graded hard. there is another teacher who teaches this course so get him instead b/c you'll fail with richards
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	1	1	5	468117	7/15/05	he is a horrible teacher. What the other bad raters said is true. Dont bother goign for help, becuase if you do, then you are an idiot, at least in his opinion. Avoid him at all costs. He smokes a craton of cigarettes a day, and looks like he is coming off of a bender everyday. I am suprised he is still alive.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	3	1	5	468117	3/17/05	...rude, arrogant,unpleasent to work with. Takes on a attitude that if we don't get it because its just so easy of course.. then we are morons. Told us roughly half the class will fail. I've gone to him for help several times and felt like a moron when I left. one of the worst i've had at ub :-(.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	0	Engineering	207	3	2	4	468117	2/27/05	Thinks everything is so trivial and easy and doesn't get why no one does well...can be a bit impatient and rude. avoid taking this class with him you won't learn much
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	2	Engineering	207	1	4	5	468117	3/3/05	He's the best teacher I've had yet at Buffalo. Very straight-forward in his approach. His test format is awful, though. When it takes up to 15 minutes to solve a problem and he gives you 4 questions to solve in a 50 minute timeframe, that's sort of asking a little too much.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Rowland Richards	2.3	1	Engineering	207	5	3	3	468117	10/5/04	He doesn't like 3D static problems so avoids them in class and on exams. Grading also allows for anyone with over a 67% to have an A overall. Not interesting to listen to. Class is boring. He has occassional humorous outbursts though.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Rickus	4.5	2	Theology	247	4	5	5	162088	3/13/13	This was an awesome class. Professor Rickus is a real nice and easy going guy who has a great knowledge about the Bible. Anyone who is serious about learning about and digging more into the Scripture will enjoy this class for sure!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Rickus	4.5	2	Theology		3	5	5	162088	8/30/05	Great course, great prof. Retired Lutheran Pastor. He gets my highest gratitude and praise as a scholar. That is coming from a very traditional Catholic theology student. Two thumbs up.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Rickus	4.5	2	Theology	247	4	5	3	162088	10/22/09	Pretty easy course overall. He's really helpful and willing to explain anything. Also really friendly, easy-going, and a real nice guy.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Robert Rickus	4.5	1	Theology		3	3		162088	9/10/04	Gospel of John and the Apocalypse. Fascinating topic very knowldegable prof, class always meets T/R and always in the classics dept in Ellicott.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	3	5	3	837263	12/28/09	Must read and know the entire textbook. All information required is fair game on exams. Gives pop quizzes in the beginning of class and is usually on material she is lecturing on that day; so basically reading ahead puts you ahead.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309	1	2	1	837263	12/18/09	cold hearted. Boring lecture. Ridiculous long and hard tests.U are supposed to know everything or u will fail. no extra credit ever. She isnt good enough being professor.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309	1	2	4	837263	7/18/09	omg.. the worst prof ever. she makes you read the entire text book, so make sure you buy the book. she gives you exam on things that she did not cover in class. Lecture can be a little boring, but exams are really hard. Memorize the text book, if you want to pass her class. good luck.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	310	1	5	5	837263	4/24/09	You better go to class and pay attention because this makes the assessment paper that much easier! and pop quizzes happen so go to class! It's really easy to slack off in this class so dont! Everything adds up and you will need it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing		1	1	1	837263	12/27/07	worst professor ever! Guess what you need to study! Making things more complicated.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	1	2	2	837263	5/26/07	pop quizzes on random things. study before and after class/lab
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309	4	1	3	837263	12/18/06	not too bad, just study study study
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309310	1	1	1	837263	4/24/06	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	3	5	2	837263	12/26/09	ok the class is not as difficult as ppl say, but do plan on studying alot harder for this class then any other nursing course you had before. KEY NOTE= YOUR TEXTBOOK IS YOUR LIFE IN THIS COURSE, everything come from it. You have 4 exams including the final all cumulative. But this course is passable. I got a B+ and I slacked at times (but dont).
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	3	3	3	837263	12/5/09	like they say, read read read the book and do the workbook! she also gave random ridiculous questions from the ATI book we JUST received. shes' kinda nice but tests are just long and stupid. glad its almost over
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309	2	1	2	837263	6/17/09	Make things more difficult than it should be! Make student guessing as to what to study!! Give nervous and extremely serious lecture!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	2	3	5	837263	5/4/08	Class is very difficult, but study the book front to back!! Dont worry about class notes just read the book. Exam questions are the nitty gritty details a lot of the time. Do reading beforehand if possible bc she does give pop quizzes, but they are of very little importance to your grade. She is an awesome professor, very intimidating but very nice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	2	Nursing	309	4	4	3	837263	7/7/07	Memorize the textbook
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	310	1	1	5	837263	1/28/07	You have to find out what to study, which book to use to study for the exam and assignments!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Elizabeth Riegle	2.6	0	Nursing	309	1	1	5	837263	10/13/06	Unhelpful, does not give you the chapters to study.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E S Rinfrette	3.4	2	Social Work	505	4	3	3	1323644	6/21/12	She is a kind hearted teacher that gives a well rounded course. Some movies I feel should be required in our program as well as others. An A is very possible.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E S Rinfrette	3.4	2	Social Work	506	5	5	3	1323644	11/16/10	i enjoy going to her lectures and yes it is pretty much the text but she has these easy exams when i took her in fall 2009, it was pretty much straight from the lecture and the text once you read.i would recommend her she is very nice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E S Rinfrette	3.4	0	Social Work	505	4	1	2	1323644	5/10/11	Very flighty; kind of all over the place with her lectures. She appears to want to teach only clinical knowledge, but we were supposed to be learning THEORIES of human behavior and development. For last half of the semester she didn't even teach and instead relied upon student presentations to do the teaching for her. Unacceptable.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	E S Rinfrette	3.4	2	Social Work	505	4	5	1	1323644	10/23/09	i really like her, she may seem a little all over the place but i still think she is good,she pretty much repeat the textbook but thats ok. she gave us quizzes every class from the reading, not so bad. she is very nice and cool. she sometimes curse in class which to me is a culture shock am not use to professor curising in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	2	5	2	162098	10/24/12	Very helpful when you ask questions. Even handed out bonus points on tests for asking questions during lecture. Homework was fairly challenging, as were the tests. No trick questions, just a lot of stuff to know. Two group projects were appropriately challenging. Not an easy class but you do learn a lot. Highly recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	337	2	5	4	162098	5/12/12	Extremely thorough, patient. Sometimes seems to be rushing through material, but he explains everything very clearly and always answers questions. Keeps class itself interesting with coding and other exercises. Actually, an interesting class, and puts more work into teaching than many other teachers I've had. Projects can be long and hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	3	4	2	162098	11/29/11	Good teacher, lab is mandatory and includes programming which he usually gives an outline of how to do, homeworks are from the book, tests are based on homeworks and labs and you get a 5x8 note card for them. Not too hard to get a good grade if you put in the work.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	0	Mathematics	337	1	1	4	162098	5/6/11	If you do not have at least 1 year of programming experience in either Matlab or C++ DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He claims you don't need any prior programming experience and that is false. He will not help during office hours - the most help you'll get is him repeating what he said in class. He is also very demeaning if you do not understand the info.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	2	5	4	162098	3/5/10	One of the few professors that really cares to make student learn! He'll take pictures of lecture notes just so you can reference them later. His office hrs are usually packed because people know he is good but if you contact him on your own he's very willing to help. Homework is doable if you pay attention and the necessary questions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	1	4	4	162098	12/24/09	Really difficult professor. Get more extra work in recitations than help with work already assigned. Too much time spent on chapter one and too little on harder chapters. Very busy man, difficult to get in contact with if you're having trouble. Office hours are only twice a week, and almost always crowded. Would be better if he was more available.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	1	5	5	162098	12/10/09	Best Professor at UB but at the same time he is the hardest one.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	443	2	5	3	162098	4/18/06	Excellent professor. Gives good lectures, and is very approachable out of class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	241309	3	5		162098	2/19/04	Best teacher at UB. Gives bonus points(real ones) for asking questions in class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	337	3	5	5	162098	8/27/12	Wonderful math professor. He's a little bit awkward at first, but will do anything to help you out and is quite patient. Overall he's incredibly nice and a great teacher. For 337, the class wasn't easy, but if you start the projects early enough you'll easily get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	3	162098	1/2/12	Really nice guy. He's really good at explaining the material in lecture. Weekly homeworks and labs aren't too hard, but the two projects were very difficult but kind of fun at the same time. The tests really aren't that hard if you do the homework and go to class. I highly recommend Dr. Ringland for any class!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	141	1	5	4	162098	8/15/11	Very nice guy, very good teacher, should not be teaching Calc 1. Seems too smart for it. Has THE HARDEST tests you will ever see at UB
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	337	2	5	4	162098	4/19/11	Ringland is a great guy, and an awesome professor, but don't come into his class with any delusions of not trying. He expects the best effort from everyone, and he puts forth his own best effort. Office hours are mobbed, but he's willing to set up extra time (don't skip and then expect him to hold your hand, though!) Expect 6-7 hours/wk of HW.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	2	5	3	162098	12/26/09	Great professor. Very smart man who expects a lot out of students. Takes pictures of class notes and sometimes class (weird). Homework weekly that can be difficult and timely. Helpful in office hours, but can sometimes go to far. Class does math projects (using knowledge and Maple 13). Exams are difficult, but has extra cred. AMAZING grading scale.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	306	1	5	5	162098	12/14/09	Best math professor I have ever had. Don't choose him if you just wanna pass or get an easy A. But if you really wanna learn something, he's your best choice.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	437	1	5	4	162098	4/19/08	Difficult Class, but you learn the material. I highly recommend him for math majors, but would tell non-majors to stay away from him unless you really want to learn some math.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Ringland	4.7	2	Mathematics	455	4	5	5	162098	5/18/05	The best math professor I've had yet at UB. Extremely approachable and willing to help. Definitely knows his field and then some.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	4	5	3	951295	3/26/13	Lance is the best professor I've had at UB. He's very intelligent. He teaches using real-life senarios that are relatable for all students. He doesn't use a text book. He does post his lecture notes on UB learns, but you still need to go to class because many examples he gives in class are on exams. Definitely take com 225 with him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	4	4	5	951295	4/19/12	Awesome lecturer!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	4	951295	12/24/10	One of the best professors at UB. Very friendly guy and class is not boring. I learned a lot and highly reocmmend him. Lots of grading options, which helps. The book was so-so and only 25% of test questions are from book. Tests are hard, but papers are easy. Am happy to report I actually find myself using stuff I learned in this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	5	5	5	951295	12/10/10	By far and away my favorite teacher of all time. He relates to his students like no other teacher. He is funny, helpful and extremely interesting. The type of guy you'd love to have a beer with. Take Com 225 and any other class you can by him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	4	951295	4/12/10	Lance is the best professor at UB. He's friendly and helpful. You really get the sense that he actually thinks of you as a human being. I really can't say enough good things about the guy. The class is interesting without being too easy. You should probably just take it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	231	5	5	4	951295	5/22/09	best teacher ive had in college. very fun, down to earth, personable, and fair. easy to contact. made sure everyone was grasping the material before he moved on. excellant teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	2	5	5	951295	5/17/09	Best teacher I ever had. This class was 3 hours long and I was able to pay attention the entire time. Not only did he lecture, but he had class activities, and movie clips, and interesting stories and examples to help us students learn more about the topic. I definitely recommend Lance to other students who want to take this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	2	5	4	951295	12/31/08	Dr. Rintimaki is the best professor I have had at UB. His was the only class I've taken that I can actually use in real life. He knows how to teach and he cared if we learned in his class. I definitely recommend him to everyone taking interpersonal communications.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	4	3	951295	10/8/08	Cool professor - he is not linient whatsoever. Cool class, I'd recommend him for anyone that has to take COM225. Cares about his students and how they're doing in the class. He doesn't accept anything late EVER - no matter what the excuse. But DEF take his class if you have the opportunity!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	4	4	2	951295	8/25/08	Lance is by far the best teacher I have ever had. He truly cares for all of his students and takes the time if you need help. Go to class examples are useful on test!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	2	5	5	951295	2/26/13	Dr. Rintamaki is one of the best teachers here at UB. He does not use a textbook. However, he uses real world exercises in class that make it very interesting and makes you look forward to class. Highly Recommended.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	5	5	5	951295	4/27/11	phenomenal teacher in every respect
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	249	4	4	4	951295	12/10/10	Lance is an amazingly dedicated and engaging professor, who encourages you to learn and have fun while you're at it! He's incredible!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	249	5	5	5	951295	5/19/09	He is AWESOME
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	4	5	5	951295	2/21/09	Lance is the single best professor at UB. Cares about his students, will learn your name regardless of how many kids are in the class, which is rare at UB. Wants you to do well, so grading is done based on your strengths. Go to class, you'll do fine. I've taken two different classes with him and will try to take another if he teaches one!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	0	Communication	225	5	1	5	951295	11/14/08	Worst professor ever. A full blown narcissist. If your goals align with his your good. If not, watch out. He will never do anything that doesn't serve his own interests. He thinks the world of himself too. If people disagree with him he makes disparaging remarks. For your own good, avoid him if you can.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	4	951295	9/25/08	Lance by far has been one of my favorite professors, down to earth, funny and very personable, great teacher does not **** around, if you have to take interpersonal take it with Lance

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	380	3	5	1	951295	6/11/08	LOVE LANCE!! expectation of you is clearly stated from the beginning. classes are quality discussions and he's enjoyable to listen to!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	5	951295	5/8/08	Lance ROCKS! Best professor ever!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	4	951295	2/21/08	Lance is a great teacher. His class was really interesting and as long as you do the work and study your lecture notes you will get a good grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	3	951295	1/23/08	The best professor I ever had. He is a fantastic teacher! I really liked all the examples and stories he told to help explain concepts. He helped me outside of class and always stopped what he was doing to talk with me when I stopped by his office. I HIGHLY recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	4	951295	12/17/07	Great teacher.What some may confuse as unimportant stories actually help with remembering material from lecture,many of his personal stories are on the exams.Optional papers and final give opportunity to raise grade.Problems:don't bother with the book,didn't read it and got 90's. Also, never grades by the date he says he will, usually 2 wks late!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	1	5	2	951295	12/9/07	He definitely takes time to help you out if you are having difficulty with something. As far as work goes, he gave 16 quizzes, 4 exams, and 5 papers throughout the semester. The average grade of the exams were around a 62% and more than 75% of the class would miss quizzes since it was an 8am class. He is very anal with the papers as well, you ha
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	2	951295	6/10/08	Lance is the MAN. His class is work, but you use a lot of the material in real life. His exams aren't easy, but fair. If you go to class you'll benefit b/c he uses a lot of stories he tells in class for his exam questions which destroy the students that don't go. Take this class with Rintimaki!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	4	5	5	951295	4/20/08	Lance Rintamaki is by far the most impressive teacher I have had thus far at UB. Passionate in every way about his teaching. I encourage everyone I know to take a class with Lance and I llok forward to having him as a professor again. He is truely a remarkable person and a great asset to this University.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	5	951295	1/24/08	Lance is an awesome professor. You truely couldn't ask for better. Attendance is not taken but it helps because you would miss stuff that you need for the test. Uses tons of examples and very funny. Lots of grading options, you can capitalize your strengths or challange your weaknesses and get a good grade. Very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	2	4	3	951295	1/9/08	Really good teacher. Uses lots of examples hthat elp relate the material. Lots of options for grading. He also seemed interested in our feedback and actually seemed to use what we said. I learned a lot in this class that applies to my personal life and my career goals. I recommend this class to everyone.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	0	Communication	225	1	2	2	951295	12/14/07	terrible
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Lance Rintamaki	4.6	2	Communication	225	3	5	2	951295	1/23/07	Lance, is one of the best teacher ever had. He is really funny and loves to help with his students. He is very into helping his students, and you will laugh alot in this class. All though the class attendance is not mandatory you have to hear his stories, and he put the stories he gives in class on his test!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	207	4	5	3	993431	3/19/12	Very nice and laid-back guy. Class consisted of readings, online discussions and workshopping. I think almost everyone got an A. Class was very nice and casual. As long as you got the work done (which isn't much), he gave you the grade. Even after the deadline had passed, he reminded us to do the assignment so that he could give them a grade. :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	201	5	4	2	993431	10/6/11	Definitely one of the better English professors. The class was your typical English class, but he somehow made it more interesting than others. I found the course ridiculously easy and sometimes fun. He's very lenient and really laid back. He reminded me of a hippie from the 60s - he would sit Indian style on the desk sometimes. Haha
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	1	English	201	2	3	2	993431	4/26/10	Class was a little harder than I expected. I took it at eight in the morning and that was a real bummer. He's a cool guy, but I really didn't like this class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	101	5	4	3	993431	11/12/07	Awesome dude...loved his class. The readings assigned were interesting and actually encouraged me to do them...Overall great professor :-)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	102	4	4	1	993431	10/31/11	He seems like a really nice guy but his class subject is a really boring topic. We talk about art ALL the time and personally I don't like art. His grading is pretty easy the lowest grade he gave out in class for an essay was a B-
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	201	4	3	1	993431	12/27/10	Cool guy. I'm not a fan of the subject, but the class is a university requirement. if you have to take it with someone i'd recommend him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	201	4	5	2	993431	4/14/09	Best English teacher of my life... And i hate english
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Andrew Rippeon	4.1	2	English	201	5	5	5	993431	5/17/07	GREAT GUY GREAT CLASS I LOVE ANDREWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Merideth Rissmiller	4.5	2	Nursing	373	5	5	3	1303732	12/28/09	Explains material in simplest form making it easy to understand. Lectures are not boring. Most of exam material is from her notes. Exam questions have been irrelevant to her notes (maybe because they are recycled exam questions that weren't hers), but they are usually dropped.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Merideth Rissmiller	4.5	2	Nursing	373	4	5	3	1303732	7/18/09	Make sure you attend her lectures and understand her notes. She is very helpful, and always willing to provide assistance when needed. A great professor, however, she tend to throw some crazy question that was not covered in class on her exams. just make sure you understant her notes and the applicable sections in the textbook. Good luck.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Rivera	5.0	2	English	101	5	5	5	1119000	5/2/08	Dr.Rivera is very nice. I have many problems with my organization and grammar. She always helps to fix these problems out of class. Even though she grade essay strictly, the most important thing is I really learned many information which is very helpful for my future. If you really wanna learn something. Take her
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Ann Rivera	5.0	2	English	101	5	5	5	1119000	4/25/08	she is nice! she always helps me after class. I have many grammar problems in my essay. She circled my mistakes and explained to me how to use it. I strongly reconmand!!!Even I dont how is my grade, in her class, I learned how to become a write. Improving my writing skills.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	1	Education	620	2	2	3	1230601	12/10/12	Readings were ridiculously repetitive every week. Very little of practical value to take away from the class besides discussion groups. Honestly taught us nothing I can use while teaching...in a teaching methods class...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	2	Education	520	5	5	5	1230601	10/25/10	I really like her.She pushes you to become the best teacher you can be.I will warn you though, if you are not a good teacher, or your are in teaching for the wrong reasons, she will see right through you and call you out. Her class is only for the serious S.S.Edu majors. She does an excellent job of weeding out the people who should not be teachers
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	0	Education	542	3	1	5	1230601	11/18/09	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	2	Education	685	4	5	5	1230601	4/1/11	Dr. Robert is so AMAZING! She cares so much and wants her students to learn and be successful. i would highly recommend taking any course with her!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	0	Education	520	1	1	5	1230601	9/23/10	Dr. Robert has no idea what she is doing. Her syllabus is a complete mess and is out dated, it takes forever to figure out what she wants from a paper or an assignment. You can follow exactly what is in the syllabus and still receive a poor grade. I find her class stressful and useless. Avoid her at all costs.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Sarah Robert	3.0	2	Education	620	2	3	5	1230601	12/17/08	Dr. Robert played favorites in class you could tell who she liked/didn't and it showed in grading and criticism. Many of her lessons lacked practical value and she was biased against the students who made plans that would work in real life classrooms. Grading was all over the place. Get on her good side early and you'll be fine, she's okayish.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	3	5	5	17344	12/30/12	Do the work and you can get an a, don't and don't expect to do well. Not that bad of a professor considering the material of the course is suppose to be difficult.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	3	2	4	17344	12/21/12	If there is a super inflammatory review, ignore it. Orgo is known for causing butthurt, and kids exact their revenge via reviews. Attending class was not helpful, but reading the book thoroughly was. Tests were fair, but not easy. Ultimately, the professor doesn't matter in orgo, but your willingness to give up your social life is.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	2	3	2	17344	12/21/12	For this course, professor Richard is super nice and willing to help. So please ask questions during lectures if you have no ideas during the classes, and try to do all of book problems, and practice exams. He is bit old, and hard to understand but he is good professor. Even though I didn't do that well compared to GenChem but it's orgo seriously
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	202	4	2	4	17344	12/21/12	First of all, organic chemistry is NOT about memorization. It's completely understanding what is happening. That's why in this class you should do every practice problem available to you. Lecture wasn't completely necessary, but I always went. Tests were fair, always easier than expected. Read and practice and don't blame the teacher for failing!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	202	3	3	3	17344	12/20/12	honestly, I didn't fail his class nor did I receive a bad grade. Orgo is just too rough when you take 19 credits. make sure you put all the material in your long term memory from summer or winter break (a break before taking this course). it is pure memorization and nobody cares how much mechanisms you know. all they care about is a final answer.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	1	2	2	17344	12/20/12	It really doesnt matter who you get for organic chem. It all comes down to memorizing the textbook. Dont go to class if you want, but spend that time reading, if you put in the hours you'll do fine.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	1	1	3	17344	12/20/12	Do not rely on the curve. It really did nothing since the graders consistency was so poor. The other teachers class was a lot different then ours. So go with them. You can't understand a thing he says with the microphone. Hard course, poor teacher. And remember what a dative bond is :)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	3	4	2	17344	12/20/12	This class is not that bad. Do not let the comments scare you. Richards will help you and he wants you to do well. Read, memorize, and understand the text as well as the problems (there are tons do all of them and understand your mistakes). It is time consuming but it pays off.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	2	5	4	17344	12/20/12	Lectures are clear, and help explain material from textbook. Richard trys to let students understand what is expected for exams. Felt well-prepared for every test and received an A for the class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	2	1	4	17344	12/10/12	I wouldn't say that teaching is his strong suit. Literally he put the EXACT diagrams from the book up on a power point slide, and mumble about it for a few seconds. Nice man, and his curve is fair. Obvious that he wants students to do well, but honestly he's not going to teach you much, so if you are a good book learner he is ideal.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	3	1	4	17344	12/23/12	I will admit that I really did not find Richard useful. I did not attend lecture because I could not understand him much. He is also grouchy and he doesn't like "stupid" questions. But no matter which teacher you get, getting a good grade depends only on you (and youtube!)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	4	4	5	17344	12/21/12	People need to chill hes not a bad prof for me he was perfect, i had no trouble understanding him, curve was pretty amazing too above 800 was an A- and above 839/1000 was an A so not bad you just have to put some time in don't totally depend on the hw and practice exams you really should practice the book problems after each lecture that'll help
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	1	2	1	17344	12/21/12	TA'S are the oompa loompas of the university.They rule and the grades are all in their hands.I hate that part so much.Richar was ok,but everything is in the TA's hands.ndthey dnt care at all.In fact they rather you failed.My TA kept saying Richard should have harder exams nd that they all gave us lower grades but Richard made them be more lenient.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	2	3	4	17344	12/20/12	The only reason to bash Richards the way other people did was if you didn't put the effort into the class. Since it's a college class, the professor isn't suppose to hold your hand through the material. If you read the book his teaching style is perfectly clear and material is manageable. Richards really does care and was always willing to help
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	5	5	4	17344	12/20/12	Insanely easy. I've seen plenty of other old tests and tests from other universities to see that I was fortunate for having Richard. Hardly no mechanisms and mostly multiple choice on tests? I'm wondering how this school even accredited. Honestly.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	4	4	4	17344	12/20/12	Everyone who is writing poor reviews is just mad because they did not do well. The class is no joke, it requires a lot of work, but ANYONE can do well in it. Richard makes fair tests and that is all anyone can ask. TO GET AN A DO THIS: book problems, book problems, the practice tests, and book problems.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	3	3	3	17344	12/20/12	Reading is a MUST for this class. Richard tries his best to lecture but regardless, the material is still difficult. I couldn't stay awake during his lectures so I skipped class. Read the textbook/go through his ppts and you'll do fine. His exams are fair and straight forward. The curve is consistent with previous semesters. I Got an A-.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	5	4	3	17344	12/20/12	Dr. Richard was a wonderful teacher. He understands that the material is hard so he does not give any surprises on the exams. Study the notes and especially the textbook and learn the rationale behind the material and you are golden.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	1	1	1	17344	12/19/12	It's a hard class regardless of the teacher, but Richard really doesn't help anything. I went to class every day but I doubt it made a difference. He just talks about what the textbook says and doesn't elaborate. His review sessions are also useless-I always left feeling more confused. Study the book like it's your job.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	2	3	1	17344	12/9/12	I often had difficulty understanding him because he had a tendency to mumble. I was disappointed to realize that the weekly review sessions mentioned in the syllabus did not occur. Text book and online homework were very helpful, but exams were still difficult. His curve is fair though. Reading the book and doing those problems is very helpful.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	2	4	3	17344	1/19/12	It's in general a hard course, he does his best to help, but It might just be because he's old and doesn't hear well that he never really answers the question like you want him to, but he really is there to help. Tests were fair and so was the curve, it's just hard material, can't help that. Oh, and you can barely understand him over the mic.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	4	4	3	17344	12/11/11	Great professor. Hard to understand if you sit in the back, front three rows are definitely suggested. Explained things very well in slides alone and lecture was an even better supplement to them. Awkward guy, decently helpful in office hours, but very open to questions during class. Relatively hard class, but best out of the 3 professors by far.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	5	5	5	17344	1/18/09	Review sessions are very helpful. Tests are not too difficult if you read his lecture notes and do last years exams.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	1	3	5	17344	1/8/09	Organic Chem is A LOT OF WORK. Read every chapter, do as many problems as possible do the practice exams, and go to TA office hours. Dr. Richard's test are hard but the curve is crazy and he is the most boring teacher I have ever had.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	1	5	4	17344	12/23/08	Caring and helpful instructor
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	1	1	3	17344	12/17/08	Organic is a very difficult class and him being a terrible teacher makes it twice as hard.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	2	2	3	17344	12/13/08	Use the powerpoints from online and the book. Don't just memorize. Understand everything. He's not the warmest guy. Lecture is crazy boring. He's not friendly during office hours and doesn't seem all that interested in actually teaching. It's hard material regardless, but put the work in and DO WELL IN LAB because it's a quarter of the grade.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	1	1	1	17344	8/5/08	he hardly ever shows up to class and instead sends subs who cant speak english . when he actually attends class he doesn't teach anything and just reads off his slides. tests are extremely unfair and include material not covered in class. i got an A first semester of orgo and when i took him got a B! BEWARE HE DOES NOT CURVE. avoid at all costs
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	1	1	1	17344	5/8/08	Richards is a terrible teacher. Don't listen to anyone else on this website I got an A in organic 1 and he is so much harder than any other professor. He does not teach at all and his exams test on material he blatantly never taught. He never tells you what the curve is and usually more than half of the class fails.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	202	2	2	1	17344	4/22/08	Pretty bad teacher. He knows his stuff but expects everyone else to know it also. Goes way to fast. No extra credit and is never around to help. try to avoid taking with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	3	3	3	17344	12/14/11	For Organic Chem, it could have been a lot worse. My only complaint about this guy is that his voice is very mumbled (especially over the mic). I highly suggest to read the book and do the book problems. They help more than I thought they would. Good luck =)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	2	4	5	17344	4/4/09	i dont know what the deals are of the people who posted above me but it was a fair class taught by a great guy. his emphasis on how important mechanisms are really helps in CHE201. the people who commented poorly about this guy must have been stupid. by the way, i got an A in his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	3	3	4	17344	1/9/09	83% was an A...81.5 was A-...80 was B+ and 70-79 was a B. Easy class to get an A in if you do work (premed prepharm should have no problem if you were going to make it anyways)Had As in 101 and 102 and honestly thought organic 1 was my easiest chemistry A thus far. Great guy, fair tests, fun to make fun of. Book is absolute must.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	1	2	4	17344	1/6/09	Read the notes and do problems before you go to lecture if you want any hope of understanding the slides after the first exam. I would go to my TA to ask questions before I would go to him. He's mean and makes you feel stupid.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	3	4	4	17344	12/22/08	Organic is THE toughest class-it aint Psch 101 so you gotta work hard on it! Lectures are helpful, text is awesome. Work lots of problems and do well in lab. His TAs are lenient almost to a fault in grading exams. Mechanisms are the key to the final...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201	1	2	3	17344	12/13/08	Read the book AND his notes online. Don't just memorize them, understand everything so you are not tricked on the exams. The material is difficult, and he is a hard teacher. He's not super friendly and doesn't seem like he's all that interested in teaching. Make sure you do well in lab because it is 1/4 of your grade. Don't slack.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	201	2	2	2	17344	8/26/08	stay away
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	202	5	5	3	17344	5/9/08	Honestly, most of the people below me are idiots. Richard's is tough, yet predictable. He takes his exam questions right off of the lecture notes. It's just a matter of how well you study them. I did and got perfect scores on most of the exams, and just received an A in the course. Definitely recommended, and he speaks good english!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	1	1	4	17344	4/23/08	This is the worst class I have ever taken! I've always been a good student who goes to class but not with this guy. He's a horrible teacher and you learn nothing! I would say maybe 15% of the class still bothers to go. His tests are also super hard. I did well last semester with Gong but this guy is impossible! Avoid him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	202	1	3	1	17344	4/1/08	Richard and Hangauer were the only professors available this semester for Organic. Richard's old exams from when he taught 3 years ago are NOTHING like the exams he currently gives and he doesn't teach the way he gives exams. Put in 10x the effort and studying than Hangauer's, earn half the points b/c Hangauer has a ridiculous curve!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	1	1	1	17344	8/30/06	Do not like him at all. Never helps when you need it. BORING Not good curve at all and no extra credit!!!!!!!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	20	4	5	5	17344	5/17/06	Very nice teacher, and very approachable. His exams are very straightforward and easy to understand, unlike Savino's. Richard is by far better than Savino, so I don't understand why Richard receives lower ratings. Great teacher, wonderful help!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	0	Chemistry	202	3	3	4	17344	5/11/06	He is the most moditoned and un enthusiastic teacher I have ever encountered
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	202	4	5	2	17344	7/15/05	nice teacher. easy eaxm. big curve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry		3	5		17344	8/31/04	very helpful...tests are not that difficult...attend the review sessions!! org. w/ him is not too bad :) (but do study!!)
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry		5	5		17344	5/10/04	Very good prof. If you study a lot, you can get a high A in his class. I ended up with perfect scores on most tests, but you have to put in the effort. He is also very willing to help students out if he sees that they care.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201202	1	5	1	17344	6/13/06	in this class an a is definitely attainable it takes hours of dedication. Richard's exams are difficult but fair if u've REALLY have studied. u'll want to rip your hair out while taking the class but u'll walk away knowing a lot. great curve at the end too. bit unapproachable at first. keep going and u'll find him very helpful and nice
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry	201202	1	3	2	17344	5/15/06	So yeah, he's a great teacher... if you're willing to dedicate your life to organic while you have him. Otherwise find a teacher that gives easier tests because even with the curve you have to study your butt off to keep up with him. Read the book and attend lecture, it helps!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	201	4	5	3	17344	11/20/05	This class is a very difficult class, but he is a very easy teacher to understand and is willing to help any student who is confused. There is a curve at the end of this class, so no worries for those who are at average with the rest of the class. DO need to read the book to keep up with the course material.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	2	Chemistry	202	2	5	5	17344	4/19/05	Holds Saturday review sessions and is very approachable - he really wants students to do well and is very helpful. Exams are a little challenging but he gives a good curve (and extra credit questions on exams!) You can not go to class, read the book, and still get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	John Richard	3.2	1	Chemistry		1	5		17344	5/10/04	requires alot of studying but if you put in effort will pay off plus he gives a good curve.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jolene Rickard	2.8	2	Fine Arts	105	4	5	3	1103075	3/31/11	Learned a lot!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Shawn Rider	3.0	1	Not Specified	121	5	2	4	1082439	12/24/07	It wasn't until the 300 lvl classes that he really started to become a total jerk. He ranted a lot about politics and most of the time. He also criticized me as lazy when I struggled to keep up with class and family issues which he knew about. He was overzealous and he picked favorites amongst his students. Glad to hear he's not teaching anymore.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	102	4	5	3	1201350	8/19/12	Matthew Rigilano is a great teacher. His class is fun and interesting and he gave out assignments that I enjoyed completing. He is more than fair with grading and even let me turn in an assignment a little late after I talked to him about it. Get this professor if you can, you won't regret it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	201	4	5	4	1201350	10/5/11	Great professor and you'll be lucky to have him. He's extremely intelligent and a great teacher.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	4	5	2	1201350	1/23/11	Amazing english teacher. Always available to help go over papers. Not a lot of work and very fair grader. Would 100 percent recommend him
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	2	4	4	1201350	11/11/10	great teacher great personality..tough grader though, recommendable but you better work your ass off on those 4 assignments.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	2	4	2	1201350	11/18/09	The class had 4 papers and a few response papers. Wanted everyone to think critically and analyze everything which was hard to do what he wanted. Hard grader for the most part. Attendance counts so never miss a class! Overall an OK class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	5	5	4	1201350	11/20/08	the Coolest English teacher I ever had. 4 papers overall and very easy topics. He is very nice and very fair. I loved his class and it was always makes the class interesting. Be aware he always wears a hat in class LOL!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	102	4	4	1	1201350	11/29/11	A great professor...he knows the English language very well, and he knows how to teach people to write! The class is fairly easy, if you put in a good amount of effort! I would recommend this professor to anyone!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	201	4	5	4	1201350	4/7/11	Awesome Teacher! Pretty easy class and an extremely helpful guy. I had no interest in the topic of the class, which was the environment and apocalypse, and i still did well and had no trouble paying attention in class. Overall AWESOME teacher!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	4	5	4	1201350	12/12/10	Best english teacher ever, very fair grader and is always available to go over papers. Not too much work and is straight forward. Recommend taking him!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	101	3	5	4	1201350	11/18/09	Overall, a fair teacher. Class usually goes by pretty quickly, 4 papers and some reading. He's always willing to help with any of the assignments given. Bit of a tough grader thou...
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew J. Rigilano	4.5	2	English	201	3	4	4	1201350	5/7/09	Class was very interesting and not boring at all. Teacher was the best English teacher I have ever had. Class definitly recommended!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donna Ringholz	5.0	2	Communicative Disorders	151	4	5	5	1708876	11/6/12	Love the class. She is super nice and willing to help you if you are struggling. Lowest test grade is dropped and you get ten extra points onto your grade just for coming to class and doing extra credit (in-class). Definitely do not miss lectures!! I struggled a bit because the material can be confusing, but she helped me so much!!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Donna Ringholz	5.0	2	Communicative Disorders	151	5	5	5	1708876	10/14/12	Great teacher! The class itself is interesting and she explains everything really well. You only have 3 tests and the lowest is dropped. They're really easy just go to all the lectures and you'll be fine!
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	3	5	4	1238653	1/7/13	Class is heavily math-based. Lectures and notes are pretty good. homework is weekly and is appropriately challenging, but only 1 problem out of 4 is graded. Tests are open book/notes, but they are not easy. He definitely knows how to test you. Overall, I learned a lot and Dr. Ringuette is an excellent teacher. Also, plenty of good TAs for help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	424	3	4	5	1238653	6/10/12	He's a really great guy. Reasonable and works well with students. But the lectures are dry and crammed with derivations - which you don't end up needing to know for HW and tests. Would probably be better skipping class and working textbook problems. Labs were actually very beneficial and shortened compared to past.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	1	5	1	1238653	1/11/12	Ringuette is one of the best professors I have had at UB so far. Fluids is a difficult class, but if you put the effort in, it isn't too bad. Ringuette makes everything clear and understandable. If you don't understand something, go to his office hours. He will help you.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	4	5	5	1238653	7/15/10	Prof. Ringuette is a great guy, and this was probably my favorite class this past semester because of him. He keeps lecture interesting (as interesting as it can be). Was very fair on tests, asked realistic questions that he would go over fully during previous classes. Pay attention, and you'll do well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	338	4	4	4	1238653	1/4/09	Really nice guy, really understanding. This was his first semester, and I think he will be a great addition to the staff. I wish I could have had him for a more "meaty" class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	3	5	4	1238653	11/13/12	Ringuette was my favorite professor at UB. He made fluid mechanics understandable and enjoying. It is true that he writes a lot of notes, but that method actually is the best way to learn, since students must follow along and write the notes with him. Not many professors have done this: they either put up slides or don't write many notes at all.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	3	5	4	1238653	1/21/12	Good professor. Clearly explained material, even if he did a lot of derivations that didn't help with HW/tests. Tests open notes/book and heavily based on HW. Weekly HW, helps learn the concepts. Very approachable and reasonable. Highly recommend.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	3	5	4	1238653	10/5/10	Just an overall good man. He is interested in helping the students learn and it shows in his enthusiasm. Ringuette is fairly new to the professor scene but I have to say he was one of the best I have ever had teaching me. Like a previous reviewer, the examples for fluid statics and dynamics were practical yet conveyed the theory well.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Ringuette	4.6	2	Engineering	335	3	4	2	1238653	4/1/09	A great professor. It's his first time teaching fluid mechanics so there are some rough patches in his teaching method. He is very willing to help you and wants you to do well in his class. Fluid mechanics is a tough course to make exciting but he does his best by trying to keep the humor light and by telling stories every so often.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Risley	3.5	2	English	101	3	4	4	1143476	1/23/10	Ok, let me tell you the truth. He is a very good guy but his expectation is quite high. One day, he said in class that 'it is easy to get an B and B+ in my class but hard to get an A or A-.' But if you put your effort, A is of course possible. I had A- in his class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Risley	3.5	2	English	101	4	5	3	1143476	11/30/09	No Comments
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Matthew Risley	3.5	0	English	101	3	1	2	1143476	1/14/10	He dont follow his previous plan and always turn back the papers late. He didnt follow his grading rule as what he said in the beginning of class.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Barbara Rittner	4.8	2	Social Work	505	2	4	4	1469668	3/29/11	Took SW505 Theories Human Behavior and Development w/her. She's very pleasant, easy going and insightful. A bit too much writing though. Tests pretty easy. At times, gave info. of what to study. With effort, you can get an A in this class. I would recommend her if you don't mind writing.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Barbara Rittner	4.8	2	Social Work	580	5	5	5	1469668	8/19/10	Not really interaction with instructor, since this is an online course. The taped lectures of her are excellent though, very interesting and FULL of information. Provides hand-outs of notes and gives practice exams. Loved this course, Psychopathology, so interesting, and I learned so much!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Robb	3.9	2	Psychology		4	5	5	817460	3/5/06	Easy...Very Easy. She is interesting sometimes disorganized. NO exams! But a 15 page final paper. Also a lot of extra credit. You are responsible for your own learning though. She does not make you read the book. Although it do help.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Jessica Robb	3.9	2	Psychology	424	5	5	3	817460	5/10/06	this class is a joke - conducted like a graduate class there are no exams except a huge ass final paper, GO TO CLASS or else youll prob. fail. participate too, dont go if youre not a talker, shes cute and goofy

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	2	English	201	2	5	3	703002	4/5/06	I disagree with the other students on this one. He centers the class around an interesting and current subject. The class ended up being thought provoking, and helped me learn to write more effectively.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	0	English	102	1	1	3	703002	1/19/06	You can predict his future status: instructor forever.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	2	English	102	3	4	2	703002	11/10/05	Is not funny and the essay sheets for requirements are unclear but it's manageable to get an A in his class. If you like complex writing don't take him because he can't make any connections unless EXPLICITLY given instructions.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	0	English	102	2	1	5	703002	1/28/06	Simply put, "excessively ornate use of the English language." He tries to act smart but fumbling his words like he can't get them out in enough time. Horrible grader.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	0	English	102	3	1	4	703002	1/14/06	The man is an idiot and reminds me of Ross from Friends. He thinks it's cool to stutter and it's not, and he always tries to use ornate language (is wrong but nobody ever tells him) and uses the word "explicitly" like crazy. If you get a B on your first essay, you'll get a B in class. Everything goes by impression with him.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Benjamin Robertson	2.7	2	English	254	4	5	5	703002	9/19/05	This was a great course. He's a TA, but he's a really fun teacher as long as he doesn't stand up there and lecture. Engage the class in discussion and it's a blast. I really slacked off in this class and I still did really well in it.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Judith Robinson	4.3	2	Library Science	501	4	5	5	52546	2/14/12	best professor 0utstanding presentations excellent class prep,prompt feedback,always helpful
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Judith Robinson	4.3	2	Library Science		5	5	4	52546	8/11/06	Great teacher, easiest coursework in the department. You can learn a lot if you want to, but you can float through and still get an A.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Judith Robinson	4.3	0	Library Science	518	4	2	1	52546	3/30/05	She is boring and a diehard Republican who loves the United States government. She loves to favor female students over 35 in her classes. The classes are uninteresting and she babys her students.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Judith Robinson	4.3	2	Library Science	567	3	5		52546	11/28/03	Dr. Robinson is one of the kindest people you will meet in Buffalo. She loves her students and her students love her. She knows EVERYTHING about United States government information. She is fabulous! I want to her when I grow up!

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Judith Robinson	4.3	2	Library Science	518	4	4	3	52546	1/11/07	Robinson is a great teacher. Sometimes it's hard to understand what she wants done and it's frustrating. For ex. she wanted us to make a pathfinder and everyone is new to lib sci and nobody knew what to do. Other than that, keep up with the work to do well. Bring your laptop to veer from boredom. I took notes a total of 5 times. Open book tests.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Ann Rogers	4.7	2	Accounting	635	5	4	4	815246	11/25/09	Half-semester communication class in MBA program. She's pretty much the nicest person in the world, and really easy to talk to. Tests aren't hard, but be sure to pay attention to the material. Speeches are easy as long as you make sure you stay within the time allotted.

University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Ann Rogers	4.7	2	Accounting	303	3	4	1	815246	12/23/11	This doesn't really seem like it should be a core accounting class, but she is helpful and responsive to student questions, and one of the nicer professors in the program.

Nobody likes public speaking but she makes it seem very easy. She gives you alot of helpful tips for presentations and other speaking engagements. Overall i was nervous about speaking before, now i have more confidence and am less nervous.

She gives you very organized notes in lecture and her packet and sheets she gives are straightforward and helpful. The subject is interesting and she does not fool around...come to class ready to pay attention.. exam is not difficult if you study, I got 25/25 on hers.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Anne Rokitka	4.7	2	Science	300	5	4	5	841706	1/8/07	Wonderfull teacher.she is one of the best professors of PGY 300.among the 5 professors of the course I think she is the best.
University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)	Mary Anne Rokitka	4.7	2	Science	300	5	5	4	841706	5/8/07	She teaches the endocrine section right before the final. Its the easiest section, and the way she explains makes it even easier. The endocrine test questions on the final are the easiest in the course and she doesnt require very deep understanding of anything. Do you learn a lot from her? Maybe. Is she an easy A? definately.
