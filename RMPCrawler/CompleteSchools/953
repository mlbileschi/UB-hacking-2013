Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		4	5	5	4	808495	4/27/08	Really clear, and really cares about whether students are learning.
Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		4	5	3	2	808495	3/1/07	He's really nice but this econ course in general was ambiguous and I didn't enjoy it. He's probably better than the other profs though. Another thing that bugged me--he would take all qns from students and try to remember everyone's names. It was a waste of lecture time, esp since students would ask stupid qns just to be noticed.

Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	808495	3/16/06	Ran is a great professor. He really cares abour students and it shows. Also, he has a wonderful sly sense of humor. He says that his exams are fair, and it's true-- he only sticks to what was covered in lecture or homework. He'll also give advice on anything econ-related. Thumbs-up!
Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		3	5	4	4	808495	8/28/08	You really cannot complain about Ran, who is so energetic and nice. Yes,he does have an accent, but there are much much worse cases in the econ department at Stanford. Ran paces himself reasonably that it is easy to follow. His lecture slides are very clear.
Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		4	3	5	3	808495	12/11/07	Extremely clear teaching style. Made concepts really easy to understand. Midterm and final were definitely easy but it was kind of nice not to come out feeling like you had failed.
Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		3	5	5	5	808495	12/13/06	Excellent teacher; really clear. Final was too easy though, so the curve could hit you hard.
Stanford University	Ran Abramizky	4.6	2	Economics		4	5	5	5	808495	6/13/06	Excellent. Clearly taught; watch for exams though; they are easy, so the curve is high.

I had a horrible professor the previous quarter and Andersen was just wonderful, making me dislike chemstry less. =) If you're going to take Chem, take it with him!!!
Stanford University	Hans Andersen	5.0	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	1180387	3/13/07	He is a clear lecturer who teaches to the test, for the most part. Sometimes his wording on tests can be confusing, but he is really willing to help students learn.

Stanford University	William Abrams	4.8	2	Biology	173	5	5	5	4	925287	8/27/07	Great professor, engaging class. He wouldn't just lecture, he'd get conversations and debates started. The class is pretty easy-- it's easy to get away with not doing the reading, and he practically tells you how to pass the final, but it was a fantastic class. More than any other class at Stanford, this one taught me a new way to think.

Really impressed by his commitment to fact-based teaching and learning. Very objective and fair. Beinin's focus on facts and truths probably drives "Campus Watch" bonkers. I had to let-go of a lot of old illusions and disinformation, but learned a lot.

Stanford University	Joel Beinin	3.1	0	History		2	1	2	5	440038	5/12/05	Contra the previous posting, Beinin IS totally ideological in that all of his lectures and discussions are designed to lead you to his conclusions. Just because he is well-versed in his facts doesn't make him any less a propagandist. Whatever he is, he's not an unbiased or fair-minded observer.
Stanford University	Joel Beinin	3.1	0	History		2	1	2	5	440038	1/12/05	He really has no business teaching history--he's just an ideologue.

Stanford University	Nick Bambos	3.8	2	Engineering	384	3	4	5	4	711988	3/30/06	An unconventional professor: puts emphasis on principles, gives intuitive explanations instead of dry math proofs. Assignments more open-ended, looking towards research, encouraging closer interaction between student-professor than in average class. Very approachable (could do better in office hours though), you never get bored in his lectures.
Stanford University	Nick Bambos	3.8	2	Engineering	274	3	5	5	5	711988	2/15/07	Great teacher, passionate about his subject. He explains difficult concepts in a very intuitive way. I have taken several courses that cover some of these materials (on queueing and probabilistic modeling) - but his class made the stongest impression on me.
Stanford University	Nick Bambos	3.8	0	Engineering	384	5	1	1	2	711988	9/29/05	a charming first impression, but little substance behind: he cares about the appearance, but he does not care about the class results. Almost impossible to reach, student are the lowest priority: he is very flaky, always late and mostly disrespectful of the students schedule. In general, office hours need are better met with the TA, the with him.
Stanford University	Khalil Barhoum	5.0	2	Languages	101	1	5	5	3	774436	1/6/10	Khalil is a tough but fair man who is dedicated to teaching his students not only language but culture. I rank him among the most valuable professors I have ever studied from. Arabic is a hard language - and Khalil's classes are not easy - but they are eminently rewarding and worthwhile.
Stanford University	Khalil Barhoum	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	774436	12/8/05	Khalil is fun, animated, and demonstrates a genuine concern over whether his students are learning. He is very approachable and, while the class moves quite fast, a little effort can make it tremendously valuable. He is a linguistic genius, but is incredibly humble about it. I would highly recommend any of his classes.
Stanford University	Khalil Barhoum	5.0	2	Languages	120	4	5	5	5	774436	2/27/06	Khalil is an animated, concerned teacher that is always willing to answer questions. He clearly has his students in mind, and definitely has made something as seemingly incomprehensible as Arabic into a manageable class. He is particularly good at getting us to learn outside of the book.

Stanford University	Jay Bartroff	4.9	2	Statistics		3	5	5	4	529539	10/2/05	Super sweet, helpful, and trys to make jokes to keep the class interesting. Oh, and did I mention he's hot?
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	0	English		2	2	2	4	544822	3/22/10	quirky and funny, but is very demanding in terms of what he requires on papers, and grades pretty harshly. very nice and easily approachable if you need help on anything.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		3	5	5	4	544822	3/5/06	Bator is by far the best instructor I have had at Stanford. He is interesting, v. helpful, and knows what it is like to be a student. If you don't know what class to take when choosing PWR, just take whatever he's teaching.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		3	5	5	5	544822	9/9/05	I loved Bator. He was really quirky and has his idiosyncracies, but that's what makes him so great. He was a harder grader at first than he came off to be, but overall works very hard to meet with everyone and help them along. Great class.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		4	5	4	3	544822	1/2/05	Bator did a really good job with making himself available for questions through e-mail or at the library/CoHo. He was also really cool about and flexible with any problems encountered during the quarter (comp/family problems, writer's block, whatever). Really attentive, quirky, and interesting guy
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		3	5	4	5	544822	8/20/08	Not only a great PWR 1 prof, but one of the best profs I've had at Stanford.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		4	5	5	3	544822	2/28/06	Bator was a great teacher and turned out to be a great advisor even after I left his class. A very thoughtful and considerate prof. You can tell that he genuinely cares about students.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		4	5	3	2	544822	1/7/05	Bator is a very involved and helpful writing teacher who will work with you outside of class and answer all your e-mails. He has an interesting presentation style and often leaves the discussion group very open ended.
Stanford University	Paul Bator	4.3	2	English		4	5	4	4	544822	12/29/04	Bator's aloof-nutty professor quality promotes a comfortable atmosphere, nevertheless he is suprisingly attentive to his students and aware of the dynamics of the classroom. He gives his students respect and individual attention. Workload, in a nutshell: I basically wrote 3 papers for this class.
Stanford University	Adam Beberg	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	5	862180	6/29/06	I have never seen a professor mumble so much in class. Or sit as still as a statue when he lectures.
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	2	English	303	1	5	5	5	605397	3/6/10	He really knows his stuff. An excellent teacher, who works hard and expects you to work hard in return. I guess people don't like him much because he expects a degree of maturity.
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	0	English		1	1	1	1	605397	3/13/07	this guy had weed in his desk when i whent to ask him somthing hes a****dont get this crappy teacher
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	0	English		1	1	1	4	605397	1/9/06	I bet you no word in the history of english can describe all i have to say is "a plague on both his houses."
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	0	English		2	1	2	4	605397	4/26/05	don't take anything with this man unless you like being sneered at and made to feel intellectually inferior to him. he is a total jerk and entirely unapproachable.
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	0	English		1	1	3	3	605397	7/20/07	wow, i think this is what they have in mind when they refer to the "ivory tower." this man is a HUGE SNOB. i would rather break my arm than have him sneering at me for my intellectual inferiority ever again...if you like your self-esteem, then stay away...far away!!
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	1	English		2	2	3	2	605397	3/12/06	can do.. do. cannot do.. teach. what kind of people teach "english" not till class was over did i realize all is a waste of time. "humanities" useless degree. useless classes.
Stanford University	John Bender	2.3	1	English		3	3	3	4	605397	10/18/05	snore
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		5	5	5	5	896034	8/11/10	LOVE HIM, so cool, calm and helpful, best ever!
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		5	5	3	2	896034	5/18/09	Nobody else shows up at all the department events and talks to students. True sometimes he can be a grumpy old walrus, but if you ask him for help he can be great. He's not hard on grades and will edit your stuff pretty well if you ASK!
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		5	4	4	4	896034	9/18/08	v. nice, like an old teddy bear not that hard to understand either
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		4	3	4	3	896034	9/4/07	really brilliant, once you get used to the way he thinks and what he has to say about literature and poltiics, surprisingly old fashioned and conservative, but interesting.
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		5	4	4	2	896034	4/18/10	Easy, nice helpful if you go out of your way to ask for help.
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		5	5	2	3	896034	2/12/09	really helpful, nice old guy, good advice and helps you figure admin stuff out.
Stanford University	Russell Berman	3.9	2	Literature		4	3	4	4	896034	4/16/08	boring stuff he teaches, not easy to figure out what he wants or is saying, but once you get to know him he's great, and kinda hot too lol!

Stanford University	Steve Block	4.0	2	Biology		3	4	4	5	468770	3/23/13	I'm not fond of this rating system; although Block wasn't necessarily "crystal clear" or "extremely helpful," he was still awesome! He was so enthusiastic about the subject and thrilled with teaching it to us! I don't know how he would be with more dry material (we studied Mythbusters and the scientific process), but he was great for this class.
Stanford University	Steve Block	4.0	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	468770	8/25/06	a nice guy, expects alot, just make sure you've thought about your question seriously before you go asking for help.
Stanford University	Steve Block	4.0	2	Biology	241	2	5	5	4	468770	1/11/08	awesome!
Stanford University	Steve Block	4.0	0	Biology		1	1	3	5	468770	10/6/04	Evil. Very harsh and demoralizing.
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	550077	9/2/06	I have to admit that I really enjoyed this IHUM. It's easily the best winter/spring IHUM. He is crazy yet brilliant, clear, and very entertaining. The reading was very interesting and the course tied together well. I very highly recommend both Bobonich as a prof and the Fate of Reason as an IHUM in general.
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	550077	11/28/05	Bobonich is crazy but extremely clear and good at making complex ideas simple. Going to lecture is like going to a play. He's amazing...a gem.
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	550077	7/13/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	3	550077	11/30/05	Very entertaining, and he teaches the material very well, too. His lectures tend to include some kind of example or thought experiment that results in the gruesome death of an unsuspecting student.
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	3	550077	10/7/05	uses very unusual & funny examples to illustrate moral dilemmas. like candy bars laced with arsenic. very kooky, super engaging, walks down the aisles while speaking, hardly ever just "reads" from the notes. every lecture's like a miniature performance. pretty awesome.
Stanford University	Chris Bobonich	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	550077	1/7/05	Very entertaining in class- uses all sorts of crazy analogies and hypothetical situations about chandeliers falling on people and violence involving maces, shotguns, and burning oil. He is also a vegan, which is cool because it means he takes his philosophy seriously.
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	0	Computer Science	101	1	2	1	3	134687	9/24/12	Boneh may be good in his field but he is horrible at teaching.
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	2	Computer Science	255	2	4	4	5	134687	1/31/06	Dan Boneh is the man. That is all.
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	2	Computer Science	255	1	3	4		134687	2/19/03	boneh is the freakin man. that class was hard but he is such a genius and funny
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	2	Computer Science		2	4	4		134687	2/19/03	No Comments
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	1	Computer Science		1	3	2	3	134687	9/16/12	Mr. Dan clearly knows what he is talking about, but I don't. I got the hang of his lectures but the first homework questions came out of left field; it feels like I didn't even listen to the lectures. He frequently claims that this of that material is clear, or obvious or often says this or that is not necessary to explain when it SO is necessary
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	1	Computer Science	161	1	2	3		134687	9/9/03	A brilliant guy, but not the best teacher, and not really interested in teaching.
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	2	Computer Science	255	2	4	4		134687	2/19/03	No Comments
Stanford University	Dan Boneh	3.3	2	Computer Science	255	2	5	4		134687	2/18/03	Excellent lecturer, but homeworks are HARD
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics		3	5	4	1	538811	6/18/09	He knows what he's talking about...think Bush's economic policy advisor, but his Econ1B class is pretty boring. He's a nice guy, though, and loves talking to students.
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics	141	5	4	4	5	538811	10/27/08	Professor Boskin is very knowledgeable about public finance. He tells many interesting anecdotes about his work in government. He lecture style is very clear. He also invites every student to have lunch with him once the semester. One negative thing about his class is that it is quite easy and light on math....
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics		3	4	5	2	538811	7/15/05	I really liked Boskin... He was conservative, but it was a nice change. He knows his stuff, has interesting stories, and seemed excited about teaching.
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	0	Economics		3	1	1	3	538811	1/2/05	Boskin is one of the least compelling professors I have ever come across. He is exceptionally arrogant and it was clear that he wished he was somewhere else.
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics	150	4	4	5	3	538811	3/16/09	Public Finance, this guy is awesome
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics		3	5	5	4	538811	9/28/05	Excellent class, interesting subject matter. Brought the subject to life with videos and examples.
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	1	Economics		5	2	3	5	538811	4/24/05	Boskin doesn't so much teach Econ 1 as tell the class about his personal biases in economics. He is a very smart guy and he knows the field, but not great at telling the students about econ.
Stanford University	Michael Boskin	3.7	2	Economics		4	4	3	4	538811	12/19/04	Nice guy, super conservative, overall a good class.
Stanford University	Claire Bowen	5.0	2	Literature	101	1	5	5	3	587983	11/2/07	Professor Bowen was the best teacher ever. She makes me want to learn. And I quite fancy her good looks.
Stanford University	Claire Bowen	5.0	2	Literature		3	5	5	4	587983	3/30/05	She was great at explaining problems in my writing and helped me improve drastically. She is really nice, hip and understanding
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	2	Chemistry	173	5	5	5	5	756857	8/16/07	He is brilliant and hilarious if you can understand him. He should not, however, be teaching 31X. Non-chemistry majors are unlikely to appreciate him. He does ramble non-stop, but his ramblings are all chemistry related and more interesting than QM.
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry	173	1	1	1	5	756857	3/29/06	The homework, the tests, and the lectures are all completely unrelated to one another. Often rambles about material that's completely unrelated to the course, such as his phone call with Kasha (he wrote "KASHA" on the board for emphasis). One lecture, about 45 minutes was dedicated to random anecdotes, and 30 minutes to actual course information.
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry		4	2	2	2	756857	12/1/05	First I must say that I found this course quite easy and it was nearly as bad as its reputation. Boxer rambles on about nothing and goes out of his way to bash high school teachers. Waymouth (the other Chem31X prof) is much better.
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry		2	2	2	5	756857	11/15/05	This class is defintely NOT a repeat of AP Chemistry- and it times, appears that it's soul function is to crush the dreams of aspiring pre-meds. While friendly, Boxer rambles in class and often holds lecture overtime. Office hours aren't much better.
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry	173	2	2	2	2	756857	12/6/06	Boxer's not the greatest teacher - he goes over things extremely quickly in class, so if you can't understand the book, you're in trouble. He seemed interested in trying to get us excited about the material; he brought in a lot of papers and how they used concepts we were learning. The class was good; the book is great!! And Boxer's ok.
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	5	756857	1/9/06	No Comments
Stanford University	Steven Boxer	2.2	0	Chemistry		2	2	2	4	756857	11/28/05	The class itself is fine...except each question on the tests is worth a ton. Boxer rambles in class and holds lecture over usually. It is hard to pay attention.

Stanford University	David Brady	4.5	2	Political Science	120	3	5	5		299730	11/26/03	Best professor I've had at Stanford. Funny, informative, and interesting. I would love to take more of his classes, even though I'm not into business and public policy, which are his main fields.

Stanford University	Barton Bernstein	4.4	0	History	158	1	2	2	5	428970	3/20/07	Lectures have no bearing whatsoever for test material. Tests based solely on the 2400 pages of reading (NO EXAGERATION). Stupid reading, stupid essay questions. Very rigid and unyielding for any requests. 3 coursereaders plus several books plus many online articles. Often goes 10-15 minutes after his alloted class time slot
Stanford University	Barton Bernstein	4.4	2	History	172	4	5	5	4	428970	11/28/05	Amazing!!!!
Stanford University	Barton Bernstein	4.4	2	History		3	5	5		428970	7/5/04	Outstanding, articulate, interesting.
Stanford University	Barton Bernstein	4.4	2	History	252	3	5	5	3	428970	12/8/05	Best professor I've had so far. In addition to being amazingly smart, he is actually interested in making sure students learn something! This is a colloquium, and it's not easy, but it is definitely worth it.

Stanford University	Jo Boaler	5.0	2	Education		2	5	5	4	701848	9/25/12	Prof. Jo Boaler's class has been the best Education methodology course that I have taken at Stanford. She presents her ideas in a clear manner and really pushes her students to critically examine what we take for granted as researchers. Even if you have no interest in math, I think any budding researcher can benefit from taking this course with Jo.
Stanford University	Jo Boaler	5.0	2	Education	325	2	5	5	5	701848	8/31/12	Professor Boaler had a fast-paced, challenging course. She really kept it interesting and we did a variety of exercises and we had a variety of assessments. She was available outside of class, as well for consultation on our projects and papers.
Stanford University	Jo Boaler	5.0	2	Education	359	3	5	5	5	701848	9/19/12	Jo chose incredibly helpful readings for this course. I learned important fundamentals about research in math education from this class. We also had interesting and insightful discussions, and the research project and paper we had to do for the class were very very useful.
Stanford University	Jasmina Bojic	4.8	2	Theater	141	4	5	5	5	584470	9/29/06	she's awesome
Stanford University	Jasmina Bojic	4.8	2	Theater		4	5	4	4	584470	6/10/05	She really cares and is passionate about what she teaches. She is also incredibly helpful and has been supportive even after graduation. I would recommend whatever class she's teaching.
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English		1	5	5	5	463574	11/4/11	He is really helpful and knows what he's talking about!!!!!!
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English	100	1	5	4	5	463574	12/28/08	Brett was a champ. I ended up taking a four or more classes with him. By focusing on what literature can tell us about the meaning of a good life and so forth, Brett's classes are less English literature, and more philosophy of literature, philosophy of mind, trending towards linguistics and neuroscience. Highly, highly recommended.
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English	144	2	5	5	5	463574	11/29/06	Brett is a genius. His class is poorly structured at times, but you should take it just for the offhand insights he'll throw at you. I can't stop thinking about what he talks about in class.
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English	196	3	5	5	5	463574	4/14/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English		3	4	3	3	463574	1/11/09	actually, he teaches at the University of Dallas now and he is great. there is a lack of structure however, his philosophical based lit classes are awesome!
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English	200	2	5	5	5	463574	4/12/07	Brett is everybody's hero, for all the right reasons.
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English		2	4	4	5	463574	8/31/05	Brett is a real gem on the Stanford Campus. Don't leave without a class with him.
Stanford University	Brett Bourbon	4.6	2	English	196	2	5	5	3	463574	9/23/04	Don't be put off by the t-shirts or the rapidly recited abstractions. He makes every other English class seem boring and pretentious and empty of meaning.
Stanford University	Gordon Bower	4.9	2	Psychology	267	4	5	4	5	558668	3/14/07	amazing/ knowledgeable professor, very friendly, will be missed!
Stanford University	Gordon Bower	4.9	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	558668	2/23/05	He is such a great professor, knowledgable, smart, nice, humorous... I decided to take psych as my masters degree after i took his class. I really love him!
Stanford University	Gordon Bower	4.9	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	558668	6/1/05	A must-have prof
Stanford University	Gordon Bower	4.9	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	558668	1/20/05	Very funny and easy to learn from!
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	5	5	4	308694	11/29/12	Super awesome professor. Is able to given intuitive interpretations to very complicated mathematical concepts. Gives good explanation of the theory, and focuses on how to apply it to real world problems. I feel priveledged to have been able to take this course from this professor.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	4	5	4	5	308694	10/9/12	Extremely application oriented classes. First time I thought learning linear algebra is going to be useful. Brings in a variety of applications. Home works go well in helping understand the concepts. They are realistic and complete with matlab programs we have to write and observe. Best prof in EE!
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	364	2	5	5	3	308694	10/4/10	Really fun to go to classes.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	4	4	4	308694	2/6/08	I think that 263 has (almost) reached perfection. Great material and useful and enjoyable class. I don't know if his behavior is arrogant or if it's related to his sense of humour (which I like). He's also very witty. I think that it would be a pity to leave EE and not have taken a class from Prof. Boyd.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	1	Engineering	364	1	2	3	1	308694	5/29/06	He made easy things harder. Not a honest guy.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	3	4	4	308694	5/5/05	huge ego. listening to him dis other profs is always entertaining. Material is fast paced, general requires strong math background. easy to get left behind. He great at presenting theory - but skips out on how to apply it. (Examples might be nice)
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	3	4	4		308694	12/3/03	Great, great teacher and great class. Highly recommend EE263 to anyone.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	3	4	3	308694	11/11/12	Very crisp material and delivery. Very impressive personality and knowledge of the subject.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	364	3	3	4	4	308694	3/28/11	A lot of reviews have mentioned that Boyd is full of himself--I don't get that impression at all. He does like to rag on other fields, but most of his criticism is warranted. He has a slightly cheesy sense of humor, knows the subject well, and tries to keep the lectures entertaining. HWs are long but not bad if you're a math person.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	0	Engineering	364	1	1	2	5	308694	2/23/08	Always elaborate on the really easy points, and skip the difficult ones that most need explaining. Rather read lecture notes than going to lectures.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	5	5	5	308694	10/11/06	I've taken EE263, 363, and 364 from Boyd. Probably the best teacher I've had at Stanford. The classes are all quite applied, in my opinion; there is theory but it's always brought back down to earth with plenty of scientific computing. Just an outstanding teacher whose problem sets will let you master some challenging material.
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	364	2	5	4	4	308694	7/8/05	Very smart, but he knows it. His lectures are some of the most entertaining, but they take a lot of work. Deffinately recomend any of his classes!
Stanford University	Stephen Boyd	4.0	2	Engineering	263	2	5	5	3	308694	10/20/04	Is really full of himself and has a silly smile frozen on his face (would make a great politician)... other than that, a great teacher who exposes the hidden insights behind the subject material. The foundation he reveals will stay with you for the rest of your life.
Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	105633	1/19/07	Best math professor I have had. Very clear and concise in his explanations. Very helpful, down to earth guy. Gave me skiing tips.
Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	2	105633	11/18/05	he does card tricks in class.
Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	105633	10/18/04	With his incorrect logic and judgments as the guide, students can only be swallowed into the infinite swirl of confusion!

Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5		105633	12/9/03	Clark Bray is an extraordinary instructor. He is competent, enthusiastic, and he emphasizes theory and conceptual understanding of material.
Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	1	Mathematics		1	3	2		105633	11/2/03	Imagine having to teach a lecture on something. You decide to teach it backwards and make it as complicated as possible, and then finally at the end of 50 minutes you say something that makes sense. You are Clark Bray.
Stanford University	Clark Bray	4.3	2	Mathematics		1	4	4		105633	8/4/03	Dry lectures but they are detailed. Cute prof!

Stanford University	Tim Bresnahan	4.2	2	Economics	102	4	5	5	4	431251	11/17/05	really nice guy, always makes time for you.
Stanford University	Tim Bresnahan	4.2	2	Economics	102	5	5	2		431251	7/7/04	Lectures weren't that interesting (mainly because econometrics isn't that interesting), but Brez is really a great guy who wants you to understand the material. Tells funny stories during office hours.
Stanford University	Gordon Brotherson	3.8	2	Languages		5	4	3	5	131798	8/24/05	Hard follow at times, but has a lot of interesting things to say.

Stanford University	Ben Brubaker	4.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5		309223	12/16/03	Haha, gotta agree with the first commentor - Ben is a math genius who's nice and really helpful. He's funny too. Really clear lectures, writes everything on the chalkboard. You'll write your first essay for math in Ben's class! Awesome guy, awesome class.
Stanford University	Ben Brubaker	4.9	2	Mathematics	110	4	5	5	3	309223	12/9/07	Ben Brubaker is one of the top math professors I have ever had; he is extremely helpful, friendly, funny, and makes class extraordinarily enjoyable. Glad to see he is now at MIT although I hope he finds his way back to Stanford.
Stanford University	Ben Brubaker	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	309223	11/29/05	Brubaker is my favorite prof. thus far, very good lectures and understandable even though the material was difficult.

Stanford University	Kazuko Busbin	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	675104	1/13/07	Undoubtedly the finest professor on the planet. You will not simply learn the language, but learn to love it. Dedication to her students is unparalleled. There are none better. Take her!!
Stanford University	Kazuko Busbin	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	4	5	675104	3/7/06	Busbin Sensei is one of the most caring and superb teachers you will ever meet. She makes the fast pace of the difficult material feel much less painful and murky and, considering the toughness of Modern Japanese, that's saying a lot.
Stanford University	Blas Cabrera	2.7	2	Science		5	4	5	4	13887	3/6/09	Astronomy for non-physics majors, taught at an appropriate level with passion. Great professor. Very approachable when it comes to questions and student discussion as well.

Stanford University	Blas Cabrera	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1		13887	9/4/01	EXCEEDINGLY boring physics prof who fails to inspire students.
Stanford University	Blas Cabrera	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	3	13887	8/10/05	a really really boring one.
Stanford University	Blas Cabrera	2.7	1	Science		3	2	4		13887	9/19/03	He's bland and a tad monotonous - but he teaches you what you need to know about the subject matter.
Stanford University	Blas Cabrera	2.7	1	Science		3	3	3		13887	3/1/03	Class is mostly boring.

Stanford University	Joseph Brown	5.0	2	Psychology	180	3	5	5	4	697651	4/4/09	Excellent professor, and very passionate about the subject!
Stanford University	Gregory Brumfiel	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	941585	12/18/11	Good teacher, even though initially he honestly expected at least half of us to fail/drop his course (and would remind us how hard his class was). That said, he was a great lecturer and I learned a ton from his class.
Stanford University	Gregory Brumfiel	2.8	2	Mathematics	110	4	4	4	3	941585	7/4/08	Professor Brumfiel is, for lack of a better word, blustering. His lectures for Math110 were mediocre, but for a grad level class I bet he'd be a lot better. He's really great during office hours, though.
Stanford University	Gregory Brumfiel	2.8	0	Mathematics	110	1	2	2	4	941585	8/10/09	He assigned problem sets from the book but tested exclusively on completely different material, namely, his handouts on field theory. Not a good job at all.

Stanford University	Scott Bukatman	3.8	2	Film		3	4	4	2	136817	11/25/07	Engaging, dynamic lecturer. Smart. Witty. Bit immature, but its endearing. Approachable.

Stanford University	Adrian Butscher	3.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	1057853	3/31/08	I thought his class was hard but really good. His lectures are more theory than practice examples. If you do his problem sets carefully, the tests are not too bad, though they are still hard. He is a really cool guy to talk to, too.
Stanford University	Adrian Butscher	3.2	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	4	1057853	8/18/08	I *really* learned math with him. His tests are pretty hard, but if you do all the book questions you should be fine. Very nice guy outside of class.

Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science	107	1	5	5	5	13890	3/6/09	Great lecturer, demanding and makes sure his students learn significantly more than with other teachers in the same course. His manner seems a bit arrogant and unapproachable, but is actually helpful when asked. His classes are a CS boot-camp, do expect quite a bit of work.
Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science	143	5	5	5	5	13890	12/17/08	The best one. CS143 is really really i been was very nice. I learnt a lot.

Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	13890	5/17/06	Jerry Cain looks like a cross between Jack Bauer and Chuck Norris.
Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	13890	1/2/06	Jerry is awesome! He's really hard core, but he'll actually teach you something, and he's a very good lecturer. He'll never let you take the easy way out, but he will help you lots and explain everything.
Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science	107	1	4	3	5	13890	12/19/05	CS 107 was the most difficult class I have taken, but mostly because I didn't go to lectures. Jerry is a good lecturer, but if you don't pay attention you'll fall behind fast.

Stanford University	Jerry Cain	4.6	2	Computer Science	106	1	3	4		13890	8/4/03	VERY, VERY, VERY hard prof! I didn't want to touch CS for a long time after him, but you do get to know your stuff.

Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	3	5	4	4	1307371	7/31/12	Though only 5 sessions long, this course provided a thorough overview the various aspects of managing wealth, from increasing it through various investments, to protecting it from high fees and unnecessary taxes, to dispensing it to family and charity. PowerPoints were also received well before class and lectures followed them scrupulously.
Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	3	5	5	4	1307371	7/31/12	Prof. Carrasquilla was very approachable and would stay after class until all questions were answered. I would highly recommend taking his course to anyone looking to understand personal finance/investments.
Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	3	5	5	4	1307371	4/24/12	Carrasquilla has a wonderful approach to teaching. It was a great course! He was very good at applying concepts to everyday life. I would highly recommend him.

Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	120	4	4	5	4	1307371	8/1/12	It's a clear,helpful and well organized class.
Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	2	5	5	5	1307371	7/31/12	To tell the truth, I enjoyed Kurt's lectures very much. He is an experienced professional as well as an excellent teacher who is patient and practice-oriented. He definitely knows how to clearly interpret complicated financial things to our ordinary people in a plain and interesting way. This course is very useful, helpful, and rewarding:D~
Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	5	5	5	5	1307371	7/31/12	Very good lecturer. Good material, good presentation. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to understand better their financial questions.
Stanford University	Kurt Carrasquilla	4.8	2	Business	195	3	5	5	5	1307371	7/31/12	Very well designed course that covers a lot for only 5 classes. Really should be mandatory of all college grads for their successful life planning. Everyone will get something different out of this course and if you want more depth than one particular topic covers, Kurt seems to be quite generous with his time to spend with you after class.
Stanford University	Clayborne Carson	5.0	2	History		3	5	5	1	633527	6/29/05	Good and smart person
Stanford University	Jose Cartagena-Calderón	3.2	2	Languages	376	3	5	5	5	636254	10/9/06	Cartagena-Calderon is a brilliant professor and cares about his students. He is a scholar in his field and one of the best mentors one could have in an academic environment.
Stanford University	Jose Cartagena-Calderón	3.2	0	Languages		1	1	2	3	636254	6/25/05	Wow, what a train wreck! You will think all is well and then boom you get your grade......
Stanford University	Terry Castle	4.5	2	English	200	3	5	4	5	1254727	4/17/11	Professor castle is brilliant and her lectures are fascinating. At times her discussion facilitation is not the best...discussions are fairly unstructured and there are some awkward silences in her seminars. Nonetheless, if you get a chance to take a class from her, do it!
Stanford University	 Cellinese	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	893274	7/15/07	Absolutely fabulous in every sense! Every student should experience her knowledge, wisdom, sense of humor and beauty.

Stanford University	David Cheriton	4.2	2	Computer Science	249	3	4	5	5	247365	8/31/05	**ESSENTIAL CLASS** Presents his personal theories on object oriented programming paradigms and code maintenance -- the most interesting programming course I took.
Stanford University	David Cheriton	4.2	2	Computer Science	249	2	4	4		247365	9/9/03	Essential course for anyone who plans to pursue software engineering.
Stanford University	David Cheriton	4.2	2	Computer Science	249	3	4	4		247365	10/19/03	An excellent teacher with very good insight.
Stanford University	Eamonn Callan	4.0	2	Education		3	3	4	4	946189	11/8/07	FED lectures are boring. Callan is probably the better of the group of lecturers, clearly presents information, though there is a lack of enthusiasm.
Stanford University	Eamonn Callan	4.0	2	Education		4	4	5	5	946189	1/9/07	Great lecturer - very clear and organized.
Stanford University	Peter Campion	5.0	2	English	192	3	5	5	3	759893	4/1/06	Peter is awesome! He really focuses on specific formal stuff-- "particularity" is his mantra. And it pays off: you'll have a feel for poetry form inside out if you take his classes. Also: HOT!
Stanford University	Peter Campion	5.0	2	English	192	3	5	5	5	759893	11/17/05	Very passionate about his subject (poetry.) Engages with students and facilitates awesome discussions. Hip without trying too hard. Sometimes he's a little spacey, but always does seem to pay attention and respond to students. Take his classes.
Stanford University	Ed Carryer	5.0	2	Engineering	118	1	5	5	4	1565658	4/19/11	Took intro to mechatronics. One of the best classes I've ever taken. Learned a ton about mechanical engineering (had only done any EE and CS) which was so much fun. Come on, I got to cut designs with lazers! How could it not be a great class? Ed offsets the huge amount of work by being a great great teacher.
Stanford University	Laura Carstensen	3.9	0	Psychology		4	1	2	4	538782	4/6/09	Be very careful. Charming on the outside, but has a highy negative reputation among many graduate student. Her authorship/lab ethics are questionable.
Stanford University	Laura Carstensen	3.9	2	Psychology	162	5	5	5	4	538782	3/18/05	Knows the subject extremely well; very interesting lectues AND awsome reading material for the most part. The class is vey laid-back and not extremely time-consuming.
Stanford University	Laura Carstensen	3.9	2	Psychology	162	3	5	5	5	538782	12/1/06	Take her class... and if you can, join her lab group... Wonderful instructor and advisor!
Stanford University	Laura Carstensen	3.9	2	Psychology		3	4	4	4	538782	12/19/04	Passionate about her subject.
Stanford University	Gerhard Casper	3.7	2	Humanities		3	5	5	5	67585	11/28/05	You learn an incredible amount from Prof Casper, and he's amazingly personable.
Stanford University	Gerhard Casper	3.7	2	Humanities		2	5	5		67585	12/16/03	Engaging lecturer! It's really neat to have someone with so much experience lecture freshman year. He also makes students a priority, and is a funloving guy in general- he likes to call on people, know their names, make jokes, etc. And ... cool accent ;)
Stanford University	Gerhard Casper	3.7	0	Humanities		2	2	2		67585	11/17/03	He's kinda weird

Engaging and inspiring lecturer, truly a kind-hearted and incredibly knowledgable person. Take IHUM-Citizenship, or you'll have to get into Stanford Law to learn from him!
Stanford University	Gerhard Casper	3.7	2	Humanities		3	5	5		67585	9/19/03	Very knowledgeable - knows what he's talking about. Interesting speaker.

Stanford University	Chris Chafe	4.8	2	Music		5	5	5	5	831877	4/19/11	I have taken many computer music classes with Professor Chafe over four years and also TA'ed for him. He is one of the best professors I have ever had, and also a great person. He makes a great advisor too. I really can't speak highly enough of him.
Stanford University	Chris Chafe	4.8	2	Music	220	5	5	4	5	831877	4/12/06	This class is great! The prof is really easy-going.
Stanford University	Page Chamberlain	5.0	2	Geology	101	3	5	5	3	613493	3/30/06	Page Chamberlain is the most fun and most knowledgeable professor around. His field classes rock. Hearing him lecture is highly entertaining - including very useful information about the earth and climate, mixed with hilariously opinionated raves.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	3	5	5	4	1256446	3/16/12	Best professor I ever had at Stanford, in my honest opinion. Lots of creative ways of teaching which sparks intelligent minds to really think and engage.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	3	5	5	4	1256446	3/15/12	Practical with much hands on experience. An inspirational course which motivates independent thinking.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	4	5	5	3	1256446	3/14/12	not a bad class. helpful and reasonably efficient teaching. grades are easy.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	0	Engineering	256	2	1	1	3	1256446	3/3/10	Disorganized and poorly prepared for lecture. Does not have a course textbook, instead makes you buy course readers, one of which is in illegible, incomprehensible longhand, the other which is inconsistent in notation, error-prone and impossible to follow due to huge gaps in logic and explanation. The worst course in my educational career.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	3	5	5	3	1256446	3/15/12	Practical with hands on experience. An inspirational course which motivates independent thinking.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	3	5	4	3	1256446	3/15/12	extremely knowledgable with highly conductive reasoning. Highly recommend for any engineering major.
Stanford University	Fu Kuo Chang	4.2	2	Engineering	256	4	4	4	4	1256446	9/28/11	lack of textbook makes it a little hard and he's sometimes difficult to follow, but he's willing to help and the grades are not hard to come by.
Stanford University	Stan Christensen	5.0	2	Management		5	5	5	3	488874	9/21/11	I certainly fell in love with the art of negotiation. Stan has a persuasive teaching capability. When I took this class I only wanted to learn some negotiation skills, but after this class, I really want this to become one of the core skills. Thanks to Stan.
Stanford University	Stan Christensen	5.0	2	Management	242	4	5	5	3	488874	2/27/08	This class is so worth it, across majors. You learn negotiating process skills that will help you with a lifetime of people-interactions.
Stanford University	Stan Christensen	5.0	2	Management		5	5	5	5	488874	11/6/04	Stan is a great professor! He is intelligent, funny, and totally easy!
Stanford University	Stan Christensen	5.0	2	Management	285	3	5	5	3	488874	5/29/08	Stan is an amazing professor, very easy to talk to and always concerned about the the students. He taught 'real world' skills which I use everyday in my personal & professional life. I highly recommend any course taught by Stan esp. Negotiation (MS&E 285). I am sure people's life will change forever after learning from Stan.
Stanford University	Stan Christensen	5.0	2	Management		1	5	5	5	488874	11/6/04	This was the best class I took at Stanford. Stan is an amazing person. The things I learned in his class are not just academic, but are also valuable and practical for life in general.
Stanford University	Barbara Clayton	2.4	0	Classics		1	1	1	5	808843	5/4/07	horrible. talks too much, but manages not to say anything worthwhile. beware! beware! she always has one or two favorites in each class, but she hates everyone else. she can't distinguish between constructive criticism and sadistic assualts on one's character(by my count, one in four people cried after any given round of paper conferences). escape.
Stanford University	Barbara Clayton	2.4	2	Classics		3	5	5	2	808843	12/19/06	Professor Clayton was great. She was not the easiet teacher, but she seemed to honestly care that we learned the material

Stanford University	Keith Coleman	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	2	878188	8/20/06	Keith Coleman is the academic equivalent of a set of jumper cables for my studies in computer security. His rakish good looks make every lecture a must. O, to be a slide in his PowerPoint presentation.

Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		3	4	3	5	771916	8/28/08	There are people who absolutely disliked him. He is definitely not the easiest or most crystal clear, but he has a talent to stimulate critical thinking that is rare in introductory chemistry. I really enjoyed that part, but more disliked him precisingly because the class is too creative - meaning the exams can get hard. Don't just memorize
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		3	4	4	3	771916	1/23/07	good professor who explains concepts clearly. The nerdy sense of humor bit mentioned earlier is true, and sometimes makes for amusing lectures.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		2	4	3	4	771916	9/6/06	Chidsey is a nice guy, kinda nerdy but funny, who knows his stuff and generally presents it well. But sometimes he gets ahead of himself and proves equations you don't really need to know about and that don't help on tests. Willing to stay late after class to help you.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		2	4	4	4	771916	3/28/06	Professor Chidsey is a good professor who emphasizes conceptual understanding. He can be quite condescending, though. These classes are not easy.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	3	771916	12/5/05	as the facebook group says, chidsey's the man. he answers every question clearly, introduces relevant examples, is not condescending, and wears a sweet fanny pack. he also sets things on fire.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	0	Chemistry		1	2	2	5	771916	3/13/07	Chidsey likes to get creative with his tests, and while lectures are in some way connected to his lectures, for the most part the lectures are irrelevant and writing notes just wastes paper. Going to section for the class and doing the Problem sets is probably helps most, but the class is still tough.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	0	Chemistry		1	3	1	2	771916	11/15/06	Like what was said before, he proves equations you don't need for the test, but he's a very nice guy, but it seems as though he think everyone is a chem genius who knows every equation off the top of their head. Take Chem 31x if you can. It'll be easier.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	0	Chemistry		2	1	1	4	771916	5/22/06	I hope these other comments were sarcastic. Chidsey has the clarity of a polluted lake that toxic chemicals have been poured into for centuries. Avoid his classes and take Chem31X if you can.
Stanford University	Chris Chidsey	3.2	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	4	771916	12/20/05	Definitely knowlegdeable. Given, some had an obsession with him. He's a little overrated, but still a great professor. He's no god, but that what he isn't that he isn't Prof Scharberg.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	0	Engineering	220	1	1	1	4	216859	11/2/07	lousy lectures, difficult & useless projects,
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	0	Engineering		3	2	1	3	216859	12/14/06	Never take E60 with this professor. His lectures are incomprehensible. If it had not been for the book, i would have never learned anything.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	0	Engineering		3	1	1		216859	8/26/03	In response to the poster below, if you manage to learn the material, it's in *spite* of Sam, not because of him.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	0	Engineering		3	2	2		216859	5/28/03	Sam Chiu is definitely one of the worst professors at Stanford. He never understands the questions his students ask, and he always tells them that it's all so simple. His lectures are boring and ineffective, and his overuse of Excel is annoying.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	2	Engineering	120	2	5	4	4	216859	1/13/07	With regards to some of the other comments on this site -- Sam Chiu is an *excellent* teacher -- one of my favorite at stanford. MS&E120 is a difficult class, but he makes the material very interesting and engaging. He's also just a nice guy and cares about his students.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	2	Engineering		3	5	4		216859	9/25/03	Professor Chiu is a good teacher. He really cares whether or not his students learn. He's fair and a pretty nice and flexible guy. The class was fairly straight forward.
Stanford University	Sam Chiu	2.6	2	Engineering		3	4	4		216859	8/4/03	Dry lectures, but you learn the stuff.

Stanford University	John Cioffi	2.7	1	Engineering	379	5	3	3	1	478049	10/24/04	Lectures and content well organized, if a bit dry and slow. Probably was attractive in his younger days, but hasn't aged well.
Stanford University	John Cioffi	2.7	0	Engineering	379	4	1	3	3	478049	2/19/05	Lectures dry and uninteresting, and homework very much busywork. Doesn't prepare you that well for tests.

Stanford University	Marcelo Clerici-Arias	4.2	2	Economics		3	5	2		216855	2/18/04	Mildly entertaining... loves PowerPoint. Does a good job of bringing current events to lecture, but the lectures themselves go by sooo slowly.
Stanford University	Marcelo Clerici-Arias	4.2	1	Economics		3	3	3		216855	11/26/03	He wasn't a very good teacher, although he is a nice person. His accent got on my nerves.
Stanford University	Marcelo Clerici-Arias	4.2	2	Economics		3	4	4		216855	5/28/03	Marcelo's a solid lecturer, but he often doesn't cover material that's tested.
Stanford University	Marcus Cole	4.6	2	Law		2	4	4	1	813421	3/28/08	Generally a good professor, but if you do not have any economics backgroung, it may be a problem.
Stanford University	Marcus Cole	4.6	2	Law		3	4	5	3	813421	5/8/06	Best 1L prof for my section.
Stanford University	Marcus Cole	4.6	2	Law	205	2	5	5	4	813421	3/17/08	Prof. Cole does a great job of giving you a clear set of tools to attack a contracts problem. He also spends more time on theoretical issues (law & econ, critical race theory, feminist theory) than most other 1L profs. Also, he's hilarious.
Stanford University	Marcus Cole	4.6	2	Law		4	5	5	4	813421	2/22/06	very clear lecturer in 1L contracts. He's an easy grader in seminars, too. good discussion leader.

Stanford University	David Como	5.0	2	History	233	4	5	5	4	1020782	8/22/07	History 233F - Political Thought in Early Modern Britain - was an expertly-facilitated 3-student colloquium in which we read the great works of British political philosophy, including the Leviathan, and the 2nd Treatise of Government. Dr. Como treated the course as a discussion group supplemented with brief lectures. I learned a great deal.
Stanford University	Robin Cooper	5.0	2	Sociology	121	3	5	5	4	857957	6/13/06	I learned a lot from this class. Robin is really cool, and she's a great! The information is very clearly presented. Be sure to get into a lot of detail when taking the exams. She wants detail. The tests are pretty hard, but it's worth it if you're interested.
Stanford University	Charlie  Cox	4.5	2	Chemistry		1	5	4	3	1786999	12/24/12	Not too bad. This year he was manageable but outreach and the workbook proved to be very valuable. In fact, it was almost required to go to the Friday outreach to get through the course--especially the first part. Cox taught the acid/base and inorganic stuff. Fair exams--similar to the workbook with some conceptual twists. I would take him again.
Stanford University	 Cuellar	3.5	2	Law	391	3	5	5	5	366965	12/9/11	Professor Cuellar is a credit to Stanford Law School and the university as a whole. His selection of readings on the history and future of citizenship and the state was both excellent and thought provoking. The discussions in class meetings were also invaluable. If you have an opportunity to enroll in one of his classes, you should take it.
Stanford University	 Cuellar	3.5	0	Law		3	1	2	1	366965	3/28/08	Administrative Law is confusing and unclear. Professor Cuellar seems to accept this as an intractable problem, and thus to avoid providing greater clarity. He can be entertaining and often impersonates litigants and officials. However, he spends too much time doing this, and ends up rushing through the lectures that might actually clarify the law.

Stanford University	Doug Daher	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	542943	9/14/05	I miss Doug...he was a great friend and mentor
Stanford University	Eric Darve	4.5	2	Engineering	100	2	4	4	3	1071176	11/25/08	Interesting and engaging, but his scrawling on the board is sometimes hard to follow.
Stanford University	Eric Darve	4.5	2	Engineering	100	2	5	5	3	1071176	12/10/07	Amazing Professor,explains each step he is doing when he is going through really complicated stuff, very neat and on topic.But funny and personable too, very open. Also, understands we have lives too, and while the work was hard, almost no busywork. I feel like I learn alot. Oh yeah, an absolutely wonderful french accent
Stanford University	Amir Dembo	3.9	0	Mathematics	111	1	1	1	5	366798	9/1/09	Amir Dembo is, by a considerable margin, the hottest piece of ass at stanford. The only professor that could possibly be considered any hotter is Norman Sleep of the Earth Science faculty. This is not Norman Sleep btw.

Stanford University	Amir Dembo	3.9	2	Mathematics	136	1	5	4	4	366798	3/20/06	It's a really theoretical and challenging course, especially for those who do not have a strong pure math background. The professor always tries to help and is obliging and available for outside class discussions and Q&A.
Stanford University	Amir Dembo	3.9	2	Mathematics	103	4	5	5		366798	4/1/04	Wonderful guy, wonderful course. Go Dembo!
Stanford University	Abhishek Dey	4.5	2	Chemistry	151	2	5	4	3	1102063	2/9/08	I love his demos!
Stanford University	Robert Crews	3.5	1	History	323	4	3	3	4	971390	3/21/10	I took Prof Crews's class on art & ideas in imperial russia a year or so ago. It was pretty good, but disappointingly easy. It was like, read a book a week and then show up to class and regurgitate. He's not that good at leading discussion without launching into a mini-lecture. But he's really nice and helpful.
Stanford University	Robert Crews	3.5	2	History	224	4	4	4	5	971390	4/1/07	This was my first colloquium. Dr. Crews organized the course thematically, and required two 6-8 pg papers. The feedback I received on those papers was extremely useful. Dr. Crews' generosity should also be noted: when 50 students showed up for a 15-person section on the first day, he volunteered to teach a second section!
Stanford University	Mark Cutcosky	5.0	2	Engineering	110	2	5	5	5	651087	8/25/06	Very enthusiastic about teaching. Fun lectures, not too much structure, but generally fun.
Stanford University	Mark Cutcosky	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	2	651087	8/10/05	Very nice, though I wish he managed our class time better. However, he was totally willing to adapt all of our class' suggestions, so Renaissance Machine Design is probably even awesomer now then when I took it. I loved his hands on approach, passion for the subject, and his invitation to the faculty club for lunch (extended to alll in the class)

Stanford University	Laurent Demanet	3.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	5	963373	3/6/07	This guy is the****. I would highly recommend him to anyone who has any interest in math whatsoever. He's young, smart, and willing to lend a hand to any up-and-coming math student. Good going, Laurent!
Stanford University	Sik Lee Dennig	4.9	2	Languages		4	4	5	4	587984	9/15/07	Definitely worth the time; awesome professor, gives nice recommendations.
Stanford University	Sik Lee Dennig	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	587984	3/27/07	She is really friendly and always willing to spend more time to help students. Extremely enthusiastic! I really enjoyed my lessons with her.
Stanford University	Sik Lee Dennig	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	587984	5/31/07	She's super nice, fun, and is always trying to do something new and innovative to help students learn and understand Chinese better. She'll definitely help you outside of class if you need it. Plus, she goes on really interesting tangents.
Stanford University	Sik Lee Dennig	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	587984	3/30/05	She is my favorite professor. She makes class fun and I loved it. The tests and quizes were not too bad. Classes are fun and she sometimes adds movies to spice it up. definitely take this class.
Stanford University	Marton Dornbach	4.8	2	Humanities		4	5	5	4	953151	1/29/08	Wonderful professor. Thoughtful, BRILLIANT, kind, extremely helpful paper comments. Agreed about the longwindedness, but otherwise, he's spectacular.
Stanford University	Marton Dornbach	4.8	2	Humanities		5	5	4	3	953151	1/27/07	prof dornbach is so sweet and approachable. very willing to listen. even if he can be a little longwinded, he usually has something pretty interesting to say. and he has really pretty eyes.
Stanford University	Justin Du Bois	4.2	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	4	691642	6/3/11	Du Bois is the best.
Stanford University	Justin Du Bois	4.2	1	Chemistry		1	3	2	5	691642	1/12/07	he is obviously very smart but that does not make him the best teacher. he is way too fast. even the hwk is difficult without TA help. not that clear.
Stanford University	Justin Du Bois	4.2	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	5	691642	8/23/06	The best orgo chem professor I've had at Stanford!
Stanford University	Justin Du Bois	4.2	2	Chemistry		1	5	4	4	691642	9/14/07	Awesome guy
Stanford University	Justin Du Bois	4.2	2	Chemistry	221	1	3	4	4	691642	12/6/06	dubois is a good teacher, but he moves way too fast in this class; he skips over a lot. Part of the problem is that there are (college) seniors to 3rd+ year grad. students (who are taking the class the 2nd time_, so there's definitely a big range of background. Problem sets are hard; you will learn a lot, but it will be a lot of work!!

Stanford University	Jean-Pierre Dupuy	3.7	2	Philosophy	257	4	5	5	5	28399	2/27/06	The previous poster is seriously unfair. JPD is the most inspiring professor I've ever had. Few academics have the interdiciplinary breadth/depth that make his courses so exciting. He blends literature with political science, anthropology, economics, even nanotechnology! He is my IDEAL intellectual. And.. he's handsome, which helps too :-)
Stanford University	Christopher Edwards	2.0	0	Engineering		3	2	2	2	1326846	7/21/11	Very arrogant. Loved to make things more complicated than they needed to be. Thought the whole Mecahnical Engineering curriculum should be centered around thermodynamics. I have been working in industry for several years and that is the subject area that I use least from the core courses.
Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	2	English	190	2	5	5	4	959399	1/22/13	Wonderful course. Fantastic discussion leader, really listens to students and takes time to explain challenging ideas. I would definitely recommend his class!
Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	1	English		4	3	3	3	959399	6/15/12	Justin is a good teacher but prefers to discuss rather than really lecture... made it a bit difficult to take notes. There were just two exams and one really needs to read and remember the key points of all the assigned readings to do well on these exams. There was also one 5-page paper of your choice due which was pretty simple.
Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	2	English		2	5	4	5	959399	11/3/11	This was an AWESOME class. He's a great teacher. So smart and takes an interest in the students. You want to work hard for him because he makes the class super interesting. Do the readings. Hes very helpful and a fair grader. Highly suggest this class!

Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	2	English	122	2	5	5	4	959399	8/30/12	Phenomenal course. Justin has a wonderful lecture style and a knack for conveying sometimes difficult material in a fluid, understandable way.
Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	2	English		4	4	4	4	959399	3/31/12	Really nice and clearly understands what he teaches. Tends to respond to students with an "ok cool" rather than providing feedback and facilitating discussion..which was annoying. Readings could be long but they were always interesting and overall I enjoyed the class. He just needs more experience, he looks like my older brother, not a professor.
Stanford University	Justin Eichenlaub	3.9	0	English	100	1	1	1	1	959399	1/24/08	Worst Teacher Ever
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	2	Engineering	278	3	5	5	5	236142	2/7/12	He has excellent command of the material and teaches very well. Extremely well prepared lecture notes and homework and exam problems that aid learning. He is a great teacher.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	2	Engineering	278	4	5	5	5	236142	2/23/08	Very clear. Immense intuition on the subject. Extremely well-prepared notes. Explains central points with accuracy and emphasis. Very good homework problems, too, the kind that is not tedious, but really aids understanding.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	0	Engineering	278	1	1	1	5	236142	2/19/05	Views students as a nuisance. I think he is just here to do research. Avoid.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	0	Engineering	101	1	2	1		236142	8/4/03	Look around the lecture hall and you'll see many students asleep. Has a tendency to chuckle to himself at jokes no one understands or even knew were told. Nasty quizzes and exams.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	2	Engineering	478	1	5	5	3	236142	10/4/10	It expects a lot from his students, but once finished they will be able to publish in the field of information theory.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	2	Engineering	478	3	5	5	5	236142	10/11/06	One of the best courses I have ever taken. He has such a good grasp of the context and describes the subject with such a mastery that is unparalleled with other classes. If you want to get a first grade education, he is your guy.
Stanford University	Abbas El Gamal	3.4	0	Engineering	278	3	1	1	2	236142	10/20/04	Really horrible lecturer, likes to berate students who ask stupid questions and make fun of the class. Seems to really hate teaching and/or views undergraduates and masters students as a burden. Not much useful content in the course.
Stanford University	Persi Diaconis	1.0	0	Mathematics	116	1	1	1	4	791680	1/2/06	Diaconis is possibly the worst kind of teacher there is--gives difficult material but fails to explain it. He writes everything on the board and his handwriting is abominable. He lectures too fast and never bothers to check if anyone understands. He is a very smart guy and does some fascinating work, but he's an awful lecturer.
Stanford University	Gerald Dorfman	4.2	2	Political Science	123	2	5	4	4	1100025	7/5/09	Very knowledgeable, extremely personable: anyone taking his class will find him to be a great professor I'm sure.

His humor is so sweetly funny - nothing sarcastic about it (maybe he's being extra-gentle with the undergrads). Adorable, adorable, adorable.
Stanford University	Dan Edelstein	4.8	2	Languages	131	3	5	5	3	594081	1/13/06	Adorable. Bright, funny, fuzzy-haired, polymathic, informal, w/kind smile.
Stanford University	Kamran Eftekhari	5.0	2	Engineering	405	2	5	5	5	804310	1/26/06	He is the best professor that you can have. Take him, though be ready for a lot of works, but it worth it.
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	2	Economics		2	4	3	3	419852	4/21/09	HIST 101
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	2	Economics		1	5	4	2	419852	4/6/07	I disagree with the other ratings, I really liked Einav. Yes, he's foreign and the material can get tricky; he is also not the most dynamic lecturer. But he is very clear and methodical. The problem sets and exams are well chosen; they test knowledge while also challenging us to go above and beyond. I'd recommend this class.
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	0	Economics		3	1	1	5	419852	5/1/05	So uncomprehensible that I had to drop the class and take it later; so unpersonable that I didn't feel badly at all about doing it.
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	0	Economics		1	1	1	4	419852	3/16/08	Absolutely painful experience, it is so hard to understand him even though you know that he cares deeply about his students. Don't even bother asking him questions though, even though he cares about students, he thinks you should know it already, so he will dismiss your questions. The psets take forever, overshadow other class. Tests are hard
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	2	Economics	101	1	4	4	3	419852	12/18/06	No Comments
Stanford University	Liran Einav	2.8	1	Economics		1	3	2		419852	6/5/04	Don't take this class from Einav. Thick accent makes him hard to understand. Problem sets are very hard and graded very harshly.
Stanford University	Amir Eshel	5.0	2	Literature		3	5	5	4	819444	3/27/09	Prof. Eshel is not only stunningly handsome and muscular, but also very keen on his work. I, for one, commend his arduous work ethic and accessible teaching style
Stanford University	Amir Eshel	5.0	2	Literature	321	3	5	5	4	819444	3/11/06	Nicest man in the world, very intelligent and insightful. Also attractive :)
Stanford University	Amir Eshel	5.0	2	Literature		4	5	5	5	819444	3/21/06	What a wonderful man. Great intellectual, wonderful man. Great discussion moderator. Loved him.
Stanford University	Shahla Fahimi	5.0	2	Languages		2	5	5	4	784890	7/18/08	I took her class in Winter 2005 and I absolutely loved her class! I was unsure about the subject at first but her teaching method was great...she does expect you to do all assignments and tests (both oral and written)...so slackers will have a hard time ...I recommend this lecturer to anyone planning on taking Farsi course.
Stanford University	Shahla Fahimi	5.0	2	Languages	101	3	5	5	5	784890	12/19/05	She is the BEST teached yo could ever ask for!!!! The class isn't easy and she expects every work to be done, as she should, but she is SUPER helpful...I was behind at first but she helped my catch up ....now I am pretty good at this language!! (for a beginner anyways)I recommend this prof to anyone!
Stanford University	Bernard Faure	5.0	2	Religion		4	5	5	5	707714	1/31/06	Very knowledgeable and very interesting, and if you go talk to home one-on-one, is a very nice and talkative person

Stanford University	John Felstiner	2.3	0	English	175	3	1	1	4	136982	3/14/09	Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had in my college career. Rude to students, offended by multi-tasking, which was difficult because listening to him was a waste of time anyway since he never spoke a coherent since during the entire course. Created stupid busy work and had a condescending attitude, on top of all of other short comings.
Stanford University	John Felstiner	2.3	1	English		5	3	2	4	136982	8/22/06	This guy's lectures seem like they're on the verge of being brilliant, but never really quite make it. You feel like he could be the most interesting person in the world if he only wanted to be. Sings badly and often. Has focus issues. The material of the class holds its own, though, despite the strange lectures.

Stanford University	John Felstiner	2.3	0	English		3	1	1	4	136982	9/11/07	Prof. Felstiner's teaching was frustrating and incompetent. While he was amusing to listen to, the effort was almost too much. He had no logical order in his lectures, and what he taught was pointless and erratic. And yes, he shrieked in class. Like a banshee. (The rest of the course, Lit into Life, was quite enjoyable, however.)
Stanford University	John Felstiner	2.3	2	English		2	5	5	4	136982	9/11/05	Prof. Felstiner made me laugh every single lecture. He always had really interesting things to say and he made lecture highly entertaining!

Stanford University	Russell Fernald	2.8	1	Biology	163	1	3	3	4	788974	2/16/09	His lecture were interesting, but his tests were super hard. Each question was essentially a mini-essay. Go to test reviews; TAs will try to parse out the correct information. Guest lecturers were extremely interesting. Unless you have a solid grasp of Biology, I wouldn't recommend this class.
Stanford University	Russell Fernald	2.8	2	Biology	120	3	4	5	4	788974	11/13/06	Extremely entertaining, good mood. Bizzarre choice of footware, but whatevs. Fun to see him lecture, especially with unusual/funny demonstrations.
Stanford University	Russell Fernald	2.8	0	Biology	120	3	2	2	5	788974	1/5/07	Both previous comments are somewhat correct. He will teach wrong and outdated material but can do it while entertaining you. Wouldn't work in his lab, many say he is not that "honest" about his own research.
Stanford University	Russell Fernald	2.8	0	Biology		3	1	2	5	788974	12/26/05	Unknowledgeable of subject material and often provides incorrect information that ca.s must choose to correct or ignore. If you want to really know the truth (and not just be mildly entertained) pick a different professor. Hard to believe this is accepted here.
Stanford University	Michelle Elam	3.7	0	English	301	3	2	2	3	731508	6/4/10	Everyone knows that she was only hired because of her husband. There is no way that she is a Stanford caliber thinker.
Stanford University	Michelle Elam	3.7	2	English	153	3	5	4	5	731508	11/28/05	Energetic and enthusiastic. She'll make you love the material.

Stanford University	Dafna Elrad	2.1	0	Chemistry	134	1	1	2	4	825715	6/18/06	A lot of work and Elrad is no help.
Stanford University	Dafna Elrad	2.1	0	Chemistry	134	2	1	1	4	825715	3/29/06	Dafna Elrad is the worst teacher I've ever had. Her grading practices were blatantly unfair (she flunked a number of students on their decently-written lab reports), and she did not maintain the laboratory equipment, even after the supply manager warned her that the experiments wouldn't work if she did not do so. Don't take a class from her.
Stanford University	Dafna Elrad	2.1	0	Chemistry	134	1	2	2	1	825715	8/16/07	Least hot prof ever. Her class was a lot of work and pretty hard. You do learn a lot though (only useful if you want to be a real scientist). I would not characterize her grading practices as unfair, only as excessively difficult. Her voice is really annoying, especially at 8:30AM. I would much rather take this class from Moylan, despite fl
Stanford University	Dafna Elrad	2.1	0	Chemistry	134	1	1	1	1	825715	4/15/06	worst prof ever, and i really mean that. she's not even a professor, just a some plant biologist hired as a lecturer. she is completely inept as a lab manager and universally hated by the students. oh, and very not hot

Stanford University	Martin Evans	3.5	0	English	105	3	2	2	5	999789	9/2/07	Fine Professor, but turned what was supposed to be a seminar into a lecture--and a boring one at that. He was too into historical minutiae for my tastes, didn't ask us open-ended, interesting questions, just specific ones like "In which book does Satan say...." It was the worst seminar I've taken at Stanford--make sure you LOVE the subject.

Stanford University	Michael Feola	5.0	2	Humanities		2	5	5	4	1115563	3/31/08	Feola is the absolute BEST IHUM teaching fellow-- no joke. Switch into his section at all costs. 2007-08 he TFed for Fate of Reason and Freedom, Equality, Difference.
Stanford University	Erin Ferris	3.5	2	Humanities	100	2	5	5	5	535782	2/12/07	LOVED her! She is absolutely amazing, the best TA I have had during my four years at Stanford. Extremely clear with her subject matter, all her relations are really insightful. I just cannot say enough good things about her. The only thing I've heard is that she's hard. I did well in her class, but I went to office hours to clarify paper topics.
Stanford University	Erin Ferris	3.5	0	Humanities		3	1	3	1	535782	12/15/04	****, ****, ****. No help with writing essays, no insight provided other than her own ideas which we cannot use. Smoking, hateful, etc.
Stanford University	Erin Ferris	3.5	2	Humanities		3	5	2	4	535782	9/2/06	Our meetings really helped me get started writing papers. After meeting with her I knew what I wanted to say and I was excited to start writing (this NEVER happens to me!). I enjoyed our sections although I didn't enjoy many of the works we studied. She made IHUM a good experience for me, which given IHUM and especially this course is saying a lot.
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	2	English	101	5	5	5	3	136991	8/28/09	Ken's negative reviews must be from students who only care about grades and don't feel safe in a class where tired scholarly analysis won't impress the professor. Ken's "rambling lectures" are not only captivatingly interesting, but also an inspiring example for how we ought to think- always tangentially, never linearly. LIFE CHANGINGLY FUN!
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	1	English		3	3	3	5	136991	4/2/07	Good poet with an amazing archive of quotations in his head. Lectures have little substance though, and facilitates discussion badly with "Well, what do you think?"
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	2	English		3	3	4	5	136991	12/28/05	i took the summer class. in one word: inspiring. as a professor he was kind of boring...i must admit i fell asleep EVERY class...no joke...only because of the lecture-tell all type of talker he is BUT he was a decent guy...had GREAT stories to tell..has a lot of life experience...great class and great teacher...
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	0	English		2	1	1	2	136991	11/10/04	One of the lamest professors I ever had. Every class he yammers on about his personal problems and how they related to whatever book we read. Also a tough grader. Steer clear.
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	0	English	101	1	1	3	3	136991	7/27/07	I had to drop the class because he graded my paper as failed only because it contradicted his opinion. I felt he wouldn't allow for a discussion of differing opinions to his. This was in 1984. It was so long ago, I've forgotten the class number, but it was professor Fields and his dog, Daisy.
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	2	English		3	5	4	5	136991	3/17/06	Ken is and incredible, one-of-a-kind professor who udnerstand the deeper implications of literary works. Anybody who thinks he is boring should probably be majoring in investment banking. Have fun.
Stanford University	Ken Fields	3.1	1	English		4	2	3	4	136991	2/14/05	On the one hand, he's not a bad guy. Decent grader. On the other, he dwells rather incessantly on his former problems with the bottle, which he interrupts otherwise productive discussions to expound to the class. Also feels the need to share with us the writings of all his close friends.

Stanford University	Shelley Fishkin	3.8	1	English		4	3	3	3	766171	11/25/08	Her lectures are written like essays and hard to take notes on, and her powerpoints contain too much text. Expect to spend a lot of time on Coursework looking back over materials when you discover your notes make no sense.
Stanford University	Shelley Fishkin	3.8	2	English	138	4	5	5	5	766171	11/28/05	Best class ever taken at Stanford! She's a great person and a wonderful teacher! THE BEST!
Stanford University	Shelley Fishkin	3.8	2	English		5	2	5	3	766171	4/18/06	Not really a college level course. A little infantilizing.
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English	123	2	5	3	3	431480	8/29/08	Professor Fliegelman was one of the most brilliant professors I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. If you found his lectures boring, you don't deserve to sit in his classroom. We are all at a loss since his untimely death. Rest in peace, Professor Fliegelman.
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English	101	5	5	5	5	431480	7/6/07	best
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English		4	5	5	5	431480	7/17/06	Prof Fliegelman has justly earned a reputation as one of the world's foremost scholars on early American literature. He is a terrific speaker, but his lectures are so packed with ideas that it's understandable why some might find them a bit overwhelming.
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English	123	5	5	4	5	431480	10/13/05	He taught the best lectures I ever took in my major at Stanford. He's very passionate about American lit, and articulate.
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English		2	5	5	5	431480	12/24/07	This was one of the most intelligent men I've known. Rest in peace, Professor Fliegelman!
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	2	English	123	3	5	5	3	431480	3/17/07	Prof. Fliegelman is incredible. His lectures were some of the best I've ever attended. Anyone with the opportunity to take his class is a fool for passing it up.
Stanford University	Jay Fliegelman	4.3	0	English	123	3	2	1	2	431480	5/21/06	Although perhaps very bright, Prof. Fliegelman is thoroughly incapable of stringing together his sporatic, tangential bursts of thought into a coherent lecture. You'll generally find yourself more confused at the end of the lecture than before (in a bad way), if you even managed to stay awake. Bring the Daily crossword--you'll need it.
Stanford University	Marjorie Ford	4.0	2	English		4	4	4	5	916688	3/24/10	Best class I ever took! Got to write about music for all my papers!
Stanford University	James Fox	5.0	2	Anthropology	120	3	5	5	4	1733229	7/5/12	Extremely engaged. Enthusiastic. Unbelievably knowledgeable, but still very approachable and relatable. Experienced researcher and teacher. Excellent lectures with appropriate and engaging multimedia. Helpful and avaiable during office hours. Do not miss.

Stanford University	Brian Ferneyhough	1.8	1	Music	122	3	3	2	5	863735	12/13/11	One of the best classes I've ever taken. He is by far the most intelligent person I've ever heard, and he doesn't really try to come down to the typical student's level. Must have a strong background in the liberal arts (LOT of continental philosophy) to understand his lectures, which seem to be pretty extemporaneous but are extremely interesting.
Stanford University	Brian Ferneyhough	1.8	0	Music		1	1	1	3	863735	5/12/07	He is a terrible lecturer. His compositions may be famous, but that sure doesn't mean he can teach.
Stanford University	Brian Ferneyhough	1.8	0	Music	301	5	2	2	4	863735	7/7/11	This guy is a really famous composer (reportedly the highest paid composer in academia). I was really excited to have a seminar with him but unfortunately he couldn't care less about this class. No assigned pieces to look at before class, basically no syllabus. Don't waste your time with the class, just go read his books.
Stanford University	Razvan Fetecau	2.6	1	Mathematics	158	3	4	2	3	366800	1/30/08	Heavy accent, yet writing is very clear, notes are extremely useful.
Stanford University	Razvan Fetecau	2.6	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	3	366800	12/28/04	Hard class. All the Math 50 series profs are hard but Math 52 is especially hard. They seem to be geniuses who don't understand that we're newbies trying to learn what they've already understood a million times over.
Stanford University	Razvan Fetecau	2.6	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	3	366800	8/10/05	He is gorgeous. Don't believe me, check out his personal website (linked to the math department's). His lectures were utterly incomprehensable during class, but if I wrote down everything he said, they were very helpful when I read them over (after reading the book). His accent was also very difficult to understand.
Stanford University	Razvan Fetecau	2.6	0	Mathematics	131	1	2	2	2	366800	12/15/04	His lectures are difficult; they are all long proofs and he starts 5 minutes before class! He is however, clear if you read ahead of time. He can be (very) condescending but is helpful in office hours. Despite his harsh standards, Fetecau is personable and kind - not to mention brilliant.

Stanford University	Lazar Fleishman	1.5	0	Literature	145	4	1	2	5	1079454	12/19/07	Fleishman may be a good researcher, but he is a nightmare to work with: his lectures are tedious and banal, overly scripted, and leave no room for students to ask questions or start discussions. He is extremely unclear about his expectations for assignments: he gives broad assignments, then grades them inconsistently and without explanation. AVOID!
Stanford University	Armando Fox	3.5	1	Computer Science		2	4	2	1	545569	11/28/05	he was really great, but a little intimidating for freshmen. I took him in a freshmen seminar last year. clearly an intelligent man.
Stanford University	Armando Fox	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	545569	12/30/04	Armando's a little hard to keep up with, but he's full of energy, and his intelligence communicates itself clearly. He can make you think a little harder about what you're learning. Has unconsciously high expectations.
Stanford University	Armando Fox	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	2	5	545569	8/10/05	Digital Dilemmas is a great class, though I felt lost much of the time because I have no computer science background.

Stanford University	Estelle Freedman	3.7	1	Women's Studies	101	5	3	3		331916	3/5/04	I expected to like Feminist Studies, since I'm passionate about women's issues. Unfortunately, Freedman's class was frustratingly anti-intellectual at times. ("Let's all share this crappy author's 'vision!'" Yuck.) Engaging lectures, though.
Stanford University	Estelle Freedman	3.7	1	Women's Studies	101	3	3	3	5	331916	3/22/05	Estelle needs to take a dive into the third-wave. Release her griphold on the FS community and allow the youngins to take a crack.

Maud is so enthusiastic about her teaching, it's obvious she loves her job and the material she covers. She's friendly, funny, and really sweet. She doesn't want you to "stress out", so she lets you work with partners on assignments, and had a 2-hour final instead of 3.

Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		1	5	4	4	545566	12/20/07	Suzanne is amazing! You will hate her for criticizing your writing, and then love her at the end of the nine weeks for making you a much better person. The only bad thing about having suzanne is that no other section leader can compare to her.
Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		1	4	4	3	545566	8/25/06	Be afraid, be very afraid. Then be glad, be very glad. She'll work you hard, but if you make the effort, she'll help you get there and it'll really pay off. :)
Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		2	5	5	5	545566	9/5/05	Amazing section leader. Tough love definitely typifies her; but no one has ever taught me to write so clearly. She's also incredibly interesting to talk to one-on-one. :-)

Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		2	5	5	5	545566	12/4/06	she's intense, and at times you'll wish you had an easier sle section leader. nonetheless, she gives very sharp criticism and you will probably emerge from her class as a better writer.
Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		2	5	5	4	545566	4/9/06	Suzanne is a walking font of information on all topics. Her well-formed opinions, both political and otherwise, continue to impress and entertain me. She was by far the best SLE discussion leader - she made clear all that was unclear in lecture, and she drew connections that none of us could have made ourselves. I love Suzanne!
Stanford University	Suzanne Greenburg	4.7	2	English		1	5	5	5	545566	7/4/05	Suzanne will break you down into pieces, and you'll be overjoyed at what you look like when she puts you back together.

Stanford University	Christian Gerdes	5.0	2	Engineering	112	1	5	5	3	650985	8/10/05	The most clear, succinct and knowledgeable professor I've had at Stanford. Made us take apart a manual transmission for a Ford Pinto on the first lab. Made 20 minute videos with complicated and entertaining plots to introduce design projects. Projects were relevant and challenging. Made us build walking robots and brought us Krispy Kremes at Lab.
Stanford University	Denise Gigante	5.0	2	English	136	1	5	5	2	1025270	12/4/08	Denise Gigante is an intellectual goddess. Keep up with her and you'll be glad you did.
Stanford University	David Goldhaber-Gordon	2.8	2	Physics		1	5	4	4	934161	9/3/07	Excellent, friendly professor. Challenging and interesting class if you love physics.
Stanford University	David Goldhaber-Gordon	2.8	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	934161	12/13/06	Physics 61 is a terrible class. The teaching is the worst part of the course. Some of the concepts are interesting but lectures are very very painful. I definately do not recommend this course and I advice you to recondsider if you are thinking about taking it.
Stanford University	Paul Goldstein	4.7	2	Law		4	5	5	5	133736	8/3/09	A very talented and inspiring professor. One of my favorites at SLS.
Stanford University	Paul Goldstein	4.7	2	Law		3	5	5	5	133736	2/22/06	one of the most clear, organized lecturers at SLS. very engaging and makes the material interesting.
Stanford University	Paul Goldstein	4.7	2	Law		3	5	5		133736	2/18/03	Very organized, disciplined, clear, and dedicated
Stanford University	Paul Goldstein	4.7	2	Law		2	4	4	4	133736	6/18/08	Wow! An outlook and approach that synthesizes east coast intensity with west coast cool. One of my favorites in law school and an inspiration for my career. Made class a pleasure and made the profession of being law professor look like the challenge and joy that it is.
Stanford University	Paul Goldstein	4.7	2	Law		2	5	4	5	133736	1/26/05	rock on
Stanford University	Maria Gough	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	4	798968	11/6/07	She's brilliant, first off. She could be a better guide as a teacher (in the one to one sense, or in grading standards), but oh my are her lectures brilliant to listen to.

Stanford University	Jason Grissom	5.0	2	Nursing		3	5	5	5	923925	11/24/06	Jason rocked. He seems like the kind of person that would be awesome to hang out with, maybe a bunch of funny stories growing up. I learned a lot about the subject and about life. plus he is pretty to look at.
Stanford University	Joe Grundfest	4.0	0	Law		3	1	1	3	154584	2/22/06	I had heard great things about Grundfest but left disappointed. He's full of himself (perhaps rightly so), and cracks one joke after another. As such, he isn't very organized as a lecturer. he goes VERY QUICKLY.
Stanford University	Joe Grundfest	4.0	2	Law		2	5	5	5	154584	9/9/05	A firehose of information. Funny, smart and enjoys teaching.
Stanford University	Joe Grundfest	4.0	2	Law		4	5	5	4	154584	12/2/05	A dynamic leader
Stanford University	Joe Grundfest	4.0	2	Law		3	5	5		154584	2/28/03	A-mazing
Stanford University	Sepp Gumbrecht	4.5	2	Comparative Literature		2	5	4	4	1289367	10/26/10	A fantastic conversationalist and wonderfully generous and genius teacher. My favorite one of all time. But I don't like football.
Stanford University	Sepp Gumbrecht	4.5	2	Comparative Literature		4	5	4	3	1289367	5/21/09	great brilliant helpful charming teacher
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages		4	5	5	3	273279	12/13/07	Class was very good, had to pay attention to what was going on. As long as you do the work, you will do well. Very VERY attractive, but she is also very modest. I wouldn't mind taking that class again!!!
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	273279	11/29/06	Best Spanish Professor ever. Hottest Prof at Stanford? NO Sir, hottest Prof in the world. Very kind, smart, an amazing person.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	273279	12/16/05	I definitely recommend this class - you'll learn a lot, and Candy is an awesome teacher.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages		3	3	5	2	273279	10/14/05	class has alot of work but she makes what u need to do pretty clear..plus shes hot

Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	273279	1/9/07	Great professor - very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And really, really, hot. A lot of busywork but it's fairly easy.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	2	Languages	123	5	5	5	5	273279	5/21/06	She's amazing. Extraordinarily kind, very willing to meet in the middle (important for those of us who didn't take 4 years of spanish in HS). Not to mention she's the hottest professor at Stanford--which can only be a plus. She's a great prof, lots of fun. You won't regret her class.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	1	Languages		3	3	3	2	273279	10/24/05	Interesting lady, "Hola Chicos y Chicas." So nice that you forget if you mess up, which isnt so good.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	1	Languages		5	3	3	4	273279	8/30/05	Fun class with a very laid back attitude yet it's easy to get distracted and forget what you're there for.
Stanford University	Candy Guzman	4.2	1	Languages		5	2	3		273279	11/2/03	People take this class WAY too seriously. I didnt buy the book and I have a very high A. Take this class if you have time to kill
Stanford University	Mai-Phuong Ha	5.0	2	Languages	150	5	5	5	1	1145434	6/10/08	best Vietnamese language professor. the first course in the series is SpecLang 150A.
Stanford University	Heather Hadlock	2.8	2	Music		3	5	5	4	795607	7/27/11	Heather is an amazing professor with such joy and enthusiasm about her subject matter. One of the best prof's I've had in the music dept.
Stanford University	Heather Hadlock	2.8	1	Music		3	3	3	3	795607	10/26/10	I can't comment on her lecturing, but I highly recommend everyone check out her seminal 1995 article published in the Journal of Sex Research. I know it made my quarter.
Stanford University	Heather Hadlock	2.8	0	Music		4	1	1	3	795607	5/28/06	Boy, this lady is stupid. I can't believe she's a Stanford professor!
Stanford University	Heather Hadlock	2.8	1	Music		3	3	3	3	795607	10/26/10	I agree. The article was very illuminating. I can't say it added to my knowledge of music but it certainly improved my sex life! And isn't that what college is for?
Stanford University	Heather Hadlock	2.8	0	Music		2	2	2	2	795607	12/22/06	Boring. Harsh grader. It's an intro seminar for gosh sakes! (she's nice though)...
Stanford University	Peter Hammond	1.0	0	Economics	160	2	1	1	5	857043	6/9/06	Basically clueless. Coupled with an arrogant attitude this makes him one of the worst professors. Truly an embarassment to undergraduate teaching.
Stanford University	Michael T. Hannan	5.0	2	Business		3	5	5	4	855318	6/2/06	I first became a fan with Disaggregation and Aggregation of Society. A real page- turner. Look for his next thriller on the Italian wine industry.

Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	204719	11/5/06	awesome
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		3	4	5	5	204719	8/25/06	Awesome teacher! Always funny and entertaining. Book is important for picky exam questions and there are always a few questions from lecture. So do both, but lecture is fun so you won't mind. ^^ Class easy to get an A in tho.
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		4	4	5	4	204719	1/5/06	Great teacher! :) Going to class is like watching a one man show. I was rarly if ever bored. And make sure you go to lecture, because there are always questions he covers that the book doesn't.
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	1	Psychology		3	1	4	5	204719	3/20/05	This guy just loves himself. If you ask him about anything that he's not directly interested in (ie memory, devo, social) he turns it back onto himself or tells you it's unimportant. Going to class is like watching him intellectually ****--funny in the abstract, miserable in practice.

Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	204719	3/19/08	He has a great sense of humor! Really entertaining. Class is extremely well organized. He's also the author of the textbook used in the class. Although, the book is kind of a pain to get through, Prof. Gross is worth it. I've heard the other two Psych1 professors guest lecture and Gross is definitely the best out of the 3. Take this class!!
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	204719	9/24/06	AWESOME
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	3	204719	4/3/06	one of the best professors ever. i was never bored during his lectures b/c he always made everything really entertaining and funny! i highly recommend taking any class he teaches, especially psych 101
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	204719	10/2/05	Funny guy! During the class, you feel like he's a peer...a peer who knows what he's talkiong about.
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	204719	1/20/05	One of the best profs I've had.
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	204719	12/14/04	Professor Gross is one of the greatest professors I've had at Stanford. He is an extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor who cares about his students and has a wonderful sense of humor. His class made me wish I had majored in psychology!
Stanford University	James Gross	4.6	2	Psychology		3	4	4		204719	5/5/03	Very approachable and enjoyable.

Stanford University	Cathy Haas	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	741162	6/6/06	Cathy is a great professor who loves her students. American Sign Language is a great language that students can take for their foreign language requirement, and Cathy makes the learning it fun. Sprinkled with Deaf culture, the class is a great way to learn about an American community that you would otherwise not understand.
Stanford University	Elizabeth Hadly	4.5	2	Biology	325	3	5	4	4	1180386	10/9/09	She's awesome! Lectures are always really interesting and tests are challenging but gage what we learn well. I recommend taking one of her classes if you get the chance
Stanford University	Scott Hall	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	819760	3/13/06	Dr. Hall is an all around awesome teacher. Lectures are clear and interesting. He is always prepared for class and is very approachable.

Stanford University	Robert Harrison	2.5	0	French & Italian		3	3	1	4	821181	3/16/06	BORING!!! I fell asleep in damn near all the lectures. Also, the man can't stay on topic for the life of him. On the upside, he does look like the Professor from Back to the Future
Stanford University	Steve Healey	5.0	2	Physics		3	5	5	4	764545	11/24/05	Best teacher I ever had anywhere, any course, and he's a grad student! Funny and explains things clearly.
Stanford University	Ursula Heise	3.0	1	English	334	1	2	4	4	965253	11/3/08	No Comments
Stanford University	Ursula Heise	3.0	1	English		3	3	3	3	965253	3/13/07	Rambling, prolix, self-involved dissertations are fraught with a cultural agenda that you'd better sympathize with beforehand--or else you will fall asleep or get upset during class. Her 'neo-hippiness' is eclipsed by an underlying bitterness that surfaces when a student displays an aversion to her idiosnycratic values. Stubborn--not recommended.
Stanford University	Scott Herdon	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	5	894764	3/4/11	He is brilliant!!!! Amazing person and professor. I learned a lot from his class and he was always very very helpful. I hope I can meet with him again in the future. Advice: meet him!
Stanford University	Scott Herdon	4.7	2	English		2	4	3	3	894764	12/21/07	Herndon is brilliant and cares deeply about his students' success. He is what all teachers should be--engaged, kind, and wonderfully intelligent.
Stanford University	Scott Herdon	4.7	2	English		3	5	5	5	894764	9/27/06	Great professor! I had a lot of fun in this class. He keeps the class very interesting and it is not outrageously hard.
Stanford University	Scott Herdon	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	3	894764	8/17/10	He is a great professor. One of the best! I learned a lot from his class, and I wish I can take the class again in the future with him. He is brilliant and taught me a lot!!
Stanford University	Scott Herdon	4.7	2	English		3	5	5	5	894764	3/11/07	He's one of the most gifted teachers and instructors around. If you want to be better @ crafting the English language, you need, NEED!!! to take a class with Scott or meet with him in the writing center...your essays will never be the same after just one session with him...
Stanford University	George Hilley	4.5	2	Geology		3	4	5	4	932969	12/11/06	George is really excited about Geology and it shows. He is a great professor who is always willing to give extra help. Watch out though- he expects a lot in return. You will learn to love geology in his class!!

Stanford University	Taylor Holubar	5.0	2	Psychology	113	5	5	5	4	1593471	8/10/12	I had Taylor over the summer and he was a great teacher. Very professional but he's pretty young and can relate to his students. He wants you to do well in the class and totally welcomes any questions. He expects you to understand overarching ideas and doesn't care too much about you memorizing details/dates/names.
Stanford University	Jennifer Hosek	4.2	2	Humanities		2	5	5	5	509340	3/13/07	She rocks!
Stanford University	Jennifer Hosek	4.2	2	Humanities		2	5	5	3	509340	3/22/06	Dr. J is great! she really knows her subject and she makes you think by asking lots of questions. She has high standards, but you always get the sense that she believes in you.

Stanford University	Jennifer Hosek	4.2	0	Humanities		2	2	2	2	509340	11/22/04	I like her as a person, not so much as a teacher. She doesn't discuss papers over e-mail and grades hard. Constantly asks you to analyze everything to death in class.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	776354	4/11/13	Best teacher I've ever had in high school, college, graduate school, and medical school. She is simply awesome!
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	4	776354	8/29/07	Fabulous course reader; lectures can get a bit dry and she can be hard to hear at times, but she does a great job teaching some pretty tough material.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		2	4	5	3	776354	12/30/06	Very clear; provides notes that are very helpful. Tests were fair.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		2	3	4	3	776354	12/21/05	She's pretty clear about things and teaches with a straight-forward style. Boring at times though. Really boring at times...
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	4	776354	4/30/11	She was the very best professor I had in college. I fell in love with chemistry because of her and she has totally inspired my teaching style.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry	130	4	5	5	4	776354	8/16/07	She is extremely helpful. Her course reader is the most useful chemistry book ever. She is very matronly.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	3	776354	12/20/06	Basically an amazing prof. Actually made me like chemistry.
Stanford University	Wray Huestis	4.8	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	4	776354	12/9/05	Absolutely fabulous professor. Very helpful and provides wonderful notes!
Stanford University	Peter Hansen	2.8	2	Economics	102	1	4	5	3	867843	3/10/08	Econ 102B with Prof. Hansen is a tough class... heavy on math but also very rewarding. Prof. Hansen includes several motivating example, mostly finance stuff. If you wanna be a finance quant.. this is a class for you.
Stanford University	Peter Hansen	2.8	0	Economics	102	2	1	1	2	867843	1/19/07	Horrible, horrible class. Was his first year of teaching though when I took it - so hopefully he has improved. Made an already dry class (if possible) even more dry.
Stanford University	Peter Hansen	2.8	0	Economics	102	1	1	1	2	867843	9/18/07	This guy is horrible, plain and simple
Stanford University	Peter Hansen	2.8	2	Economics	102	2	4	5	3	867843	7/21/06	At times very abstract and theoretical, applications and homeworks were extremely useful... but long.

I left with both practical tools and increased enthusiasm for my book idea. Bruce transformed the process from mysterious & daunting to do-able. Bruce is an affable and engaging instructor who is a NY Times Bestselling author. He knows his stuff.

Stanford University	Laurea Hubbard	4.5	2	Anthropology	148	3	5	4	2	1068217	8/20/10	Really cool and can become a mentor. Has her opinions but will still help you even if she doesn't agree. She will always give you an interesting answer to questions.
Stanford University	Donna Hunter	4.8	2	Writing		2	5	4	3	1180366	11/19/12	Donna is enthusiastic and knowledgeable. She engages the class in the already-interesting discussion of the meaning of criminality. Her extension policy is great; she cares more about your learning than school policy.

Stanford University	Nicolas Jenkins	5.0	2	English		3	5	5	5	773986	12/7/05	Prof. Jenkins was SO interesting and kind. He had such a passion for poetry. He wasn't afraid to laugh with us and was always available during office hours. He picked fascinating poems and was skilled at handling a classroom full of sleep-deprived students. During office hours, he seemed to really care about my life outside of class.
Stanford University	Susan Johnson	3.5	2	Psychology		5	3	4	5	857958	6/13/06	Zzzzz. This class was really easy. The midterm and exams are basically half taken from lecture, and half from a practice tests that she actually gives you. That's right, the questions are EXACTLY the same as the practice test. Don't buy the book or read it, you don't need it. So, yes, the class was easy, but I didn't learn much.
Stanford University	Dan Jurafsky	4.5	2	Languages	247	3	5	4	4	642752	10/14/09	jurafsky and ramscar are a great team. the most compelling class i've taken at stanford.

Stanford University	William Hurlbut	5.0	2	Biology		5	5	5	2	856040	6/6/06	To get this out of the way: I dare you find a more handsome professor at Stanford - not likely. Think Harrison Ford without the ruggedness. The powerful rhetoric, the persuasive arguments, the kindness, the gentle humor, the courage, the authenticity. I'm in love.

Stanford University	Alan Jagolinzer	5.0	2	Accounting		2	5	5	5	839285	4/29/11	best teacher at CU. Everyone thinks hes the man. great guy, really cares about his job and his students.
Stanford University	Alan Jagolinzer	5.0	2	Accounting		2	5	5	3	839285	4/27/06	Awesome prof. Made accounting fun.
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	0	Economics		3	2	2	3	239192	5/11/06	great for lecture, not seminars. what's entertaining when he's up in front of a huge class quickly gets irritating in a smaller setting.
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics		2	5	5	5	239192	5/1/05	It's a shame he's headed off to Wellesley. Who knew that macroeconomic models could be fun... and relevant? Johnson understands how to teach the big picture and not just memorization of models. Has more energy than a nuclear explosion.
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics		1	3	4	4	239192	12/28/04	Why does Prof Johnson always screech? And ppl STILL fall asleep!!!
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics		5	5	5		239192	8/12/04	Prof. Johnson--if you are reading this yourself, take it easy, we like you!

Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	0	Economics		1	2	2		239192	8/26/03	The guy thinks that yelling non-stop in class is somehow helpful. He likes to bang his head on walls and make weird noises. I guess he thinks they make lecture more lively? You'd think he'd get tired of it some time...

Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics	150	2	5	5	3	239192	3/30/05	Great professor. Classes are very hard but he makes them interesting. I think he's a visiting professor from Princeton but Stanford should definitely keep him if possible. Best lecturer I have had so far at Stanford.
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics	150	2	5	5	2	239192	12/15/04	This is the funniest, nicest, and most inspiring guy in the world. He made me want to be an Econ major. Extremely supportive, but also down-to-earth. Lectures were incredibly helpful (and amusing!)
Stanford University	David Johnson	4.0	2	Economics		2	5	5		239192	6/5/04	Prof. Johnson is the best lecturer you'll ever have. Delivers clear and interesting lectures and is passionate about the material. I wish I had taken 50 from him also.

Stanford University	Robert Jones	5.0	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	638306	9/1/05	This guy kicks ass.
Stanford University	Robert Jones	5.0	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	638306	9/2/06	He's really awesome. If you have the chance to be in his section for IHUM petition until you get a section with him. You might even like IHUM if you do. Or at least IHUM section.
Stanford University	Robert Jones	5.0	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	638306	7/2/05	The best teacher on campus for sure. Explains the concepts very clearly and makes sure you are prepared for the exam. Every one should take his class. He makes the material very interesting and is a cool guy!!!
Stanford University	Matt Kahle	5.0	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1091607	1/13/08	awesome teacher- really funny, extremely clear in his teaching. very willing to help and keeps class engaged. by far, best lecturer for 51

Stanford University	Vladislav Kargin	1.0	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	2	1180336	2/19/09	Professor Kargin is almost impossible to understand. The class is terrible. I haven't learned a thing from lecture, just from the book and section.
Stanford University	Pam Karlan	4.7	2	Law	444	3	5	5	5	844742	12/18/06	awesome
Stanford University	Pam Karlan	4.7	2	Law		3	3	5	5	844742	5/8/06	Good teacher, but very aggressive about defending her positions.
Stanford University	Pam Karlan	4.7	2	Law		3	5	5	4	844742	5/25/06	Amazing teacher, amazing person.
Stanford University	Yitzhak Katznelson	1.0	0	Mathematics	113	2	1	1	4	366791	11/17/05	Ditto what the other person said. Clearly he's a world famous researcher. His teaching though is incomprehensible. Didn't learn a thing from 113, took 114 with Milgram, and everything suddenly made sense.
Stanford University	Yitzhak Katznelson	1.0	0	Mathematics	113	1	1	1	3	366791	10/20/05	This was one of the hardest classes I've taken. His lectures are worthless cause you can't understand anything he says. Supposedly he is a genius- but in the research field. I don't doubt that. As an educator, he stinks.
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History	101	3	5	5	4	12873	8/18/06	Even for a Stanford professor, this dude is very smart.
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History		3	5	5		12873	7/5/04	One of the very best on WWII and Great Depression. Thinks highly of himself, but he's earned it.
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History		2	5	5		12873	9/19/03	Very good lecturer who managed to keep most people awake during IHUM. Knows his stuff and explains it well, too!

Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	0	History		1	1	2		12873	8/12/01	This man is egotistical -- stay away. his books suck too.
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History		3	5	5	4	12873	12/28/04	He is a great lecturer and definitely knows what he's talking about inside and out. I just saw him on a public television documentary on President Wilson - his knowledge of that period is extensive. Definitely recommended as a prof!
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History	165	3	3	4		12873	3/9/04	very interesting guy; he could really explain a coherent theory of 20th c. american history. however, he assigned WAY too much reading and the paper topics weren't very good.
Stanford University	David Kennedy	4.0	2	History		3	4	5		12873	4/22/03	Aw, I thought the cheezy humor in his book was awesome! Cool guy, knows his stuff.

Stanford University	Miranda Kershaw	2.0	0	French & Italian		3	2	2	3	1742172	8/19/12	Awful teacher, inconsiderate of student's differing learning styles, and apparently with a very weak understanding of the logics behind French grammar.
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	1	Engineering		2	2	3	3	132638	10/28/05	He doesn't teach well at all. Expects you to read most material out of the book, but goes at a snail's pace in class. That's not what a prof is supposed to do. Avoid him
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	2	Engineering		1	5	5		132638	4/6/04	The Nobel Prize will be his soon.
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	2	Engineering		3	2	5		132638	2/18/03	I think he's going after nobel prize
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	0	Engineering		2	1	1	5	132638	10/3/05	this class sucked
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	2	Engineering		1	3	4		132638	2/19/03	Jeez, his homework are tedious
Stanford University	Chaitan Khosla	3.4	2	Engineering		3	5	5		132638	2/17/03	I really enjoyed my time in the lecture. He's funny, and knows everything.
Stanford University	Paul Kim	4.5	2	Education	308	3	5	4	5	1123756	5/19/11	Lots of examples and industry connections.
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	2	Law		2	4	4	3	133712	8/17/10	Very laid-back. Knows what he is doing from real-world experience. The powerpoints are very good. You can skip class and just follow along on the ppt slides and get the gist of things (although probably not a great grade). Hot daughter.
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	2	Law		2	5	4	4	133712	2/15/08	My favorite professor!
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	2	Law	101	3	5	5	2	133712	2/18/06	Excellent teacher. I love the way he utilizes Powerpoint slides to enhance our learning experience. Not too bad looking either ; ).
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	0	Law	301	2	2	2	2	133712	7/8/08	Not recommend at all. Poor teaching skill, too laid back, does not prepare well for the class,
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	0	Law		4	2	2	3	133712	2/22/06	disorganized; not very compelling lectures.
Stanford University	Michael Klausner	3.4	1	Law		3	3	3		133712	2/18/03	Poor classroom presence, too laid back & way too reliant upon powerpoint slides
Stanford University	Matthew Kanan	5.0	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	1647913	5/9/12	great
Stanford University	Terry Karl	4.3	2	Political Science	203	2	5	5	5	136843	12/27/09	She teaches oil politics and a research seminar. I strongly recommend her because of how intelligent, informed, and articulate on a multitude of political issues. Her instruction was particularly helpful in helping me to state my ideas clearly. I admire her and I would tell anyone to take her class.
Stanford University	Terry Karl	4.3	0	Political Science		2	2	1	2	136843	9/28/05	Just an average instructor. Seems good just by comparison with the rest of the bunch

Stanford University	Terry Karl	4.3	2	Political Science	141	1	5	5	2	136843	3/2/09	One of the best professors at Stanford. If you don't take a class with her you missed out.
Stanford University	Terry Karl	4.3	2	Political Science		2	5	5	5	136843	3/28/05	great!
Stanford University	Terry Karl	4.3	2	Political Science		2	3	5		136843	8/24/04	good, insightful lectures. awesome class. LOTS of reading. if you study hard and write papers well, you'll get an A.
Stanford University	Mark Kasevich	3.6	2	Physics	107	1	5	5	3	542949	6/18/08	Great teacher, really likes undergraduates, but he's super busy so he often doesn't have time outside of class. But, hey, that's what the section leaders are for, right? Just make sure you get a good TA.

Stanford University	Mark Kasevich	3.6	1	Physics	201	3	1	4	5	542949	12/25/04	Not very accessible for extra help - but a decent lecturer
Stanford University	Patrick Keating	5.0	2	Film		3	5	5	4	832366	4/19/06	Patrick Keating is a fantastic lecturer - he explains difficult readings clearly and concisely, uses interesting and pertinent film clips, and is very willing to help students with papers (he'll read your first draft and give feedback). He is also hot. I'm sad he's leaving next year.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		1	5	2	2	133699	1/15/09	Confusing, but helpful outside of class.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	1	Law		3	4	1	4	133699	3/28/08	Kelman is a great professor, if you understand his teaching methodology. He assigns readings that present the black-letter law very clearly. He then uses his lectures to provide scholarly elaboration upon the readings. This often makes it a chellenge to understand him. However, he clearly recognizes this and tests mainly on the black-letter law.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	1	Law		3	4	1	4	133699	5/3/07	A mixed bag. Kelman is a gifted intellectual-conversant in philosophy and economics, as well as law-with a fertile and analytical mind. Deep, with many interesting ideas and insights. But he also is a poor communicator, using lots of jargon and convoluted sentence structures. Some students connect with him; others become hopelessly lost.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		3	5	2	3	133699	4/21/06	very nice guy -- but you'll do best in his 1L classes if you learn the material by focusing on the black-letter law in the reading.

Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		1	4	3		133699	8/3/04	he'll bring you nightmares.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		2	4	4		133699	2/18/03	Very dedicated, very intellectually stimulating, excellent command of material
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	1	Law		2	3	3	4	133699	6/18/08	One of the reasons I went to law school. He is a great synthesizer and plays off the black letter well. While not a danger in the classroom, he comes sometimes close because his desire for objectivity is undercut by the politics. So the message is confusing. A structuralist thinker that makes him a reactionary on race/gender.
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	0	Law		1	1	1	4	133699	6/8/07	a real reactionary posing as a lefty - a total negative on race-gender
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	0	Law		2	1	1	5	133699	1/14/07	Really unclear - does he even understand what he says?
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		3	5	2	3	133699	2/22/06	nice guy, approachable, but confusing. he's just too smart!
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	0	Law		1	2	1	5	133699	12/23/05	spectacularly confusing. reveals the dangers of tenure - that such an "osfuscationist" could be teaching at this level
Stanford University	Mark Kelman	2.6	2	Law		3	4	4	3	133699	9/9/05	Very smart. Nice guy. Old-school liberal. Was surprised but pleasent that a conservative was giving him flak. People complain that he's confusing but he does a great job of flow charting the entire material, so I don't get their problem.

Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	106	1	4	4	2	618987	11/11/11	He likes to make jokes, and he often completely changes the problem when explaining it so students are forced to think outside the box.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	4	5	4	3	618987	12/25/10	Funny. Humor is a bit on the dry side, but it's quirky good. Lectures are really really helpful. Really willing to stay after and answer your questions. Makes psets hard but tests easier. AMAZING at teaching a concept, really receptive towards you interrupting and answering questions. Definitely taking him for future classes.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	455	1	4	4	3	618987	12/4/09	Great teacher. Hard class, but very good.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	104	3	4	4	3	618987	11/12/09	Great lecturer, clear and well-paced. Funny without effort.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	106	3	5	5	5	618987	7/23/08	One of the best courses I have taken at Stan so far. And that too taught by Vadim is like an icing on the cake. He explains in such a way that even the most "difficult" topic is easy to understand
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	1	5	4	3	618987	3/17/07	Nice.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	1	5	5	5	618987	12/12/06	His classes are the hardest I've ever taken, but they really are the most rewarding. You will walk out of that class knowing all the material, and it will stay with you

Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	0	Engineering	104	1	2	2	5	618987	5/13/05	There's this theory among Stanford profs that they're not doing a good job unless their teaching is completely incomprehensible. Also, they must give at least 20 hours of homework a week. This class has made me want to graduate and never do engineering again.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	106	1	3	4	3	618987	2/2/11	Funny professor but difficult class. Be prepared to devote at least 8 hrs a week to one problem set
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	3	5	4	3	618987	2/17/10	Great class. The workload is very intense, but very rewarding in the end. The teacher is very nice and helpful. I look forward to having him as a professor for my upcoming math classes.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	3	5	4	4	618987	11/16/09	Awesome teacher. Looking forward to taking the next few classes he teaches in my math series.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	106	3	5	5	5	618987	7/23/08	One of the best courses I have attended at Stan so far is CME 106 and the fact the Prof Vadim teaches it is the icing on the cake. He makes the class real fun to learn. And has the ability to explain the difficult stuff in simple terms. Overall a great Prof teaching a great course!
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	104	1	4	3	3	618987	5/14/08	Too Hard! Good sense of humor but too much work...it dominates my life! However, a very good professor, his material is very real-world and he is very comprehensive in lectures.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering	100	1	4	5	4	618987	12/25/06	Very Good.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering		1	5	5	3	618987	11/28/05	Vadim gives a heavy workload, but his lectures are very comprehensive and he is always willing to help students get a better grasp of the materials. He definitely showed me the application of mathematics in engineering in the real world.
Stanford University	Vadim Khayms	4.3	2	Engineering		1	5	5	4	618987	7/13/05	Vadim is awesome! His class is really hard, but everything you do is useful and helps you learn, and he's very clear at explaning things, and quite funny in a deadpan way too!
Stanford University	Pierre Khuri-Yakub	3.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	94610	3/6/12	Amazing
Stanford University	Pierre Khuri-Yakub	3.5	2	Engineering		5	5	5	3	94610	5/25/05	I took his class last year and I just had to respond. If you thought it was hard, you probably didn't put in any of your own work. This guy "is" the man, he's always available at office hours and he knows his stuff. If you thought he was a bad prof, I'm willing to bet you didn't put in any time or effort on your own. Good luck in the future.
Stanford University	Pierre Khuri-Yakub	3.5	2	Engineering		1	5	3		94610	8/4/03	Not an easy class or material to learn but he knows his stuff.

Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	0	Computer Science	228	1	2	2	5	138111	3/6/09	I must say CS228 was way over my head and I decided not to do AI as a field based on the class. The weekly assignments took 8-9 days to do on average (at least to my team). From what I could gather (before dropping the class) Daphne is a decent teacher for people who have the brainpower and background to follow her.
Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	2	Computer Science	228	1	4	5	5	138111	4/18/06	Friendly but deadly.
Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	2	Computer Science	228	3	5	5	4	138111	3/29/05	Makes her course interesting

Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	2	Computer Science	228	2	4	5	4	138111	11/19/07	Daphne is awesome. She likes what she does, and makes you like it too! By the way, I think she's hot too ;)
Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	2	Computer Science	221	2	4	4	4	138111	1/13/06	clear teaching style but tendency to drastically overload coursework.
Stanford University	Daphne Koller	4.1	2	Computer Science	228	2	5	4	3	138111	10/24/04	The bottom line is you learn a lot.

Stanford University	Christos Kozyrakis	3.8	0	Engineering		2	2	2	2	730002	2/17/09	Lab handouts are not clear. Problem sets are full of typos, and unreasonably long. Lecture content will bore you to tears. Unless you are a robot.
Stanford University	Christos Kozyrakis	3.8	2	Engineering	282	3	4	5	5	730002	10/19/05	He is thorough in his teaching. Study hard and you will do well. Ladies: he is Greek, young and attractive!
Stanford University	Christos Kozyrakis	3.8	2	Engineering	108	2	5	5	4	730002	10/4/07	Good knowledge of the subject and explains well. Helpful during office hours. Quizzes aren't easy, but quiz grading is fair.
Stanford University	Jon Krosnik	2.5	1	Communication		3	2	3	2	1711742	4/18/12	His summer Political Psychology program is a complete rip-off. You have to live on campus and it's ridiculous how much housing, internet usage, etc. all costs. Speakers were really boring for the most part and it had the feeling of an undergrad session with an hour of discussion in the middle of the day. Another way to make money for Stanford.
Stanford University	Sanjay Lall	2.8	2	Engineering	207	3	4	4	4	424827	6/2/08	Excellent. I still keep his lecture notes for reference. What he teaches is not particularly simple, but he does a great job!
Stanford University	Sanjay Lall	2.8	0	Engineering		1	1	3	2	424827	4/25/07	very soft spoken and hard to hear in lecture. would be better if he taught at a more prestigious school like one of the uc's. but since he is teaching here, dont take him.
Stanford University	Sanjay Lall	2.8	1	Engineering	207	3	3	3	3	424827	5/5/05	Hmmm. Don't really like him as a prof. Nothing in particular. tests are usually 24hr take home. Difficult but doable. Gives a lot of homework solutions in problem sessions. Always easy to talk to.
Stanford University	Sanjay Lall	2.8	1	Engineering	207	2	2	3	4	424827	6/6/07	Hard to understand. Unnecessary stress on math while too little useful material covered. Can be fun if you love math, otherwise it is way too much pain for the material learnt.

Stanford University	Sanjay Lall	2.8	2	Engineering	207	3	3	5		424827	6/18/04	Excellent course notes. Good lecture style. Generally friendly. E207A & B highly recommended.

Stanford University	Pete Klenow	5.0	2	Economics		2	5	5	4	329680	1/19/07	The best Econ prof I had in my 4 years at Stanford. Extremely personable, down to earth, smart guy. Loved the lectures and learnt a lot. Wish he taught more classes here.
Stanford University	Pete Klenow	5.0	2	Economics		3	5	5		329680	1/1/04	Wonderful course, very well taught.
Stanford University	Pete Klenow	5.0	2	Economics		2	5	5	2	329680	9/7/05	tough class, but well taught. much more interesting than I thought it would be.
Stanford University	Jennifer Kohler	3.2	1	Chemistry		3	3	3	3	553961	6/18/06	Pretty hot, I guess
Stanford University	Jennifer Kohler	3.2	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	3	553961	6/30/05	SO HOT RIGHT NOW!!!!

Stanford University	Nancy Kollmann	5.0	2	History	201	3	5	5	4	1288933	5/20/09	Professor Kollmann is one of the leading scholars in her field, and it is easy to see why. A great lecturer, kind person, and knowledgeable instructor. I really learned a lot in her class and she also helps students with writing and presentations. Highly recommend to anyone.
Stanford University	Tom Kosnik	4.5	2	Engineering	145	2	5	4	5	1094185	5/1/09	Energetic, inspiring, talkative, Digresses with stories.
Stanford University	Momoyo Kubo	3.6	2	Languages		3	5	4	3	155537	11/14/10	Awesome professor who continued to teach well in the second quarter. She is both a teacher and friend in class.
Stanford University	Momoyo Kubo	3.6	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	155537	2/16/09	By far the fastest Japanese speaker in the JLCC program. Lots of grammar points. Seems tough but is really willing to help out students who go to office hours.

Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	5	5	4	136971	5/22/12	Years ago I took a sophomore seminar from him. Amazing class. Came back here 13 years later just to rave. I can't recommend him highly enough.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English	202	2	5	5	4	136971	7/26/10	He was my prof of modern American poetry at Tufts. I thought he was absolutely extraordinary and now, years later, I realize how great his influence was on me and what a wonderful teacher he was. I still remember how well he read Yeats.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	0	English		3	1	3	5	136971	11/25/05	I think that this professor tends to be biased in his treatment of students and quite narrow-minded. If the student writes in a style that appeals to his ego, he encourages, if not, disparages. A terrible judge of character and potential.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	4	5	3	136971	12/19/04	Brilliant and witty - our class seemed to amuse him. Graded generously but was still hard on ideas.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	5	5		136971	9/11/04	He gave me personal help with my writing, and taught me how to analyze literature. A really caring and accessible teacher.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	5	5		136971	2/20/03	brilliant, witty and cynical
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	0	English		3	1	2		136971	2/19/03	John L'Heureux was the single most unfair professor I encountered at Stanford.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English	101	2	5	5	3	136971	8/29/10	Great teacher with a good heart.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	5	5	4	136971	5/13/10	Took a sophomore seminar on contemporary American short fiction. One of the best classes I've ever taken. Very hard, but the expansion of my views on literature was amazing. Extremely challenging, in a good way.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		4	4	4	5	136971	10/21/05	He's completely different one-on-one than he is in lecture, and still great. Doesn't take himself too seriously. Take his classes.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	4	5	5	136971	10/29/04	You're either going to love him or hate him. He's witty, a great educator who takes no prisoners!
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	2	English		2	4	4		136971	4/29/03	Tough but helped me improve my writing.
Stanford University	John L'Heureux	3.9	0	English		3	2	1		136971	2/19/03	Pretentious in the extreme.

Stanford University	Teresa Lafromboise	3.0	2	Education	245	4	5	5	5	627763	6/1/12	Cute
Stanford University	Teresa Lafromboise	3.0	0	Education	245	3	1	2	4	627763	3/2/10	Dr. Lafromboise barely taught this class - every session there was a student presentation. I thought the readings were disconnected, boring, and not helpful. There was barely an overall class structure or any strong themes or messages. I would not take this class if I could go back and do it again.
Stanford University	Teresa Lafromboise	3.0	2	Education		4	4	4	5	627763	6/1/05	Great role model
Stanford University	Teresa Lafromboise	3.0	1	Education	101	3	3	3	3	627763	6/1/12	Smokin hot
Stanford University	Teresa Lafromboise	3.0	0	Education	240	2	2	1	2	627763	12/16/06	I found much of this class a waste of my time. We are asked to read about a dozen different theories of adolescent development and force fit them to a case study student. Prof Lafromboise did a poor job of linking the various theories together and a terrible job of explaining how the material might be useful to us as future teachers.
Stanford University	Norbert Lain	4.8	2	Classics		2	5	5	2	928912	8/1/10	Bert is incredibly knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects. I still meet with Bert occasionally and ask him for advice (about academics as well as life in general). And even though I'm now pursuing degrees in economics and statistics, Bert is still more helpful than any academic advisor. I recommend taking as many classes as you can with him.
Stanford University	Norbert Lain	4.8	2	Classics		4	5	5	5	928912	12/19/08	Bert is an incredible person. He genuinely cares about his students and he will go above and beyond to make sure you are learning. He has a tendency to digress, but his digressions are always super interesting so it's worth it and he always makes sure you learn what you you need to know.
Stanford University	Norbert Lain	4.8	2	Classics		5	5	5	2	928912	6/18/09	He's a great teacher and very interesting. He genuinely cares about his students, and really, when you're a student, you cannot ask for anything more.
Stanford University	Norbert Lain	4.8	2	Classics		3	4	4	3	928912	12/5/06	Very nice guy. Weird and off topic at times but he is a good teacher and you learn the latin he teaches...
Stanford University	Monica  Lam	4.0	2	Computer Science	191	3	4	4	2	1801552	3/11/13	Very passionate about her research
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages	181	3	5	5	5	137640	1/13/10	Brilliant. Articulate. Generous. Funny. Basically, Landy's everything good.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		1	5	5	5	137640	4/14/08	Stimulating *intellectual* experience!
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	137640	3/23/07	Landy is probably the most charismatic professor I've ever had. He's funny in a witty, self-deprecating kind of way, and seems genuinely interested in what students have to say. This makes him very approachable. He's also obviously very smart, and his views on the interaction of philosophy and literature are interesting.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	4	5	4	137640	11/28/06	Very clear lecturer who has interesting things to say about all the texts. Highly recommended.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	4	4	2	137640	11/19/05	right on. i'm glad i'm not the only one. he has the most amazing blue eyes. i seriously want to bring him to a state of existential transcendence, if you know what i mean. oh, and the class is good too.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5	2	137640	10/18/05	great guy, super smart, hot accent--a little pretentious, but what do you expect, he's british.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5		137640	5/28/03	an awesome guy. extremely nice.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	137640	1/13/10	Wonderfully illuminating course. It changed the way I think about the world. After taking the course, everything aesthetic seemed more engaging, complex, and analyzeable. Landy and his co-teacher, Lanier Anderson, are lovely both individually and together.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		2	4	4	4	137640	4/14/08	Joshua Landy is a wonderful professor. Unfortanetly, his recent praise has made him a wee bit arrogant, with a tendancy to swagger.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	4	5	2	137640	12/8/06	Very clear. This class was required and I really am not interested in it but he made it much more bearable.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	137640	2/24/06	I love this man.
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	137640	11/17/05	Where do I start?.. Prof. Landy is wonderful in so many ways, and I sincerely hope that, just because I find him extremely attractive, it won't minimize his professionalism, his excellent teaching, his great scholarship, or the fact that he's just a wonderful human being. Unfortunately, I have to stress again: he is HOT!
Stanford University	Joshua Landy	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	5		137640	7/14/04	who else can motivate you to actually go to IHUM lecture? And he is a really great guy who actually cares about individual students

Stanford University	Diamond Larry	5.0	2	Political Science	147	2	5	5	5	723474	11/29/06	Incredible professor. Very knowledgeble and helpful. Best scholar at Stanford PS. His class is a MUST.
Stanford University	Diamond Larry	5.0	2	Political Science	147	3	5	5	5	723474	3/7/06	There's a lot of reading, but it's worth it, because Diamond's passion for the subject (democracy) makes everyone in the room want to know more. If you ever have a question, he'll take the time to answer it (sometimes so much time that he doesn't finish his lectures because he answers so many student questions!). Brilliant professor, great class.
Stanford University	Ben Lee	2.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	894978	1/7/09	I don't know. I really liked him. I think he really did care about helping students to understand the material. If you told him you needed help he was very accommodating. I was grateful to him. I wish I could have him for math51 as well. He made sure everyone in the class understood before moving on.
Stanford University	Ben Lee	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	894978	9/28/06	Awful, rude and completely condescending. Opt for Math 42 if 19 is only offered by Lee. Truly appalling how little he cared about students.
Stanford University	Joel Leivick	3.0	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	144572	4/10/08	This guy is super smart and funny. Not much structure though if thats what you need. Not good if you are a total ametuer. Highly recommended if you are a serious photographer.
Stanford University	Joel Leivick	3.0	1	Fine Arts		3	2	3		144572	2/22/03	engaging, but arrogant. not as great as he thinks he is.th
Stanford University	Joel Leivick	3.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2		144572	3/9/04	An ego with clay feet. what a pity: he could have been good.
Stanford University	Lester Lawrence Lessig	2.5	2	Law		3	2	5	4	813422	8/17/10	Not the most personable guy, but very smart, and he really teaches you about how the Supremes go about assessing cases (based on his knowledge as a former clerk an a very close observer of the caselaw).
Stanford University	Lester Lawrence Lessig	2.5	0	Law		2	1	1	5	813422	5/25/06	Terrible. The worst professor I've had in law school. Brilliant, but arrogant and should not be teaching large classes. Unhelpful, won't meet with students, and cares only about teaching HIS theory.
Stanford University	Lester Lawrence Lessig	2.5	1	Law		4	1	4	4	813422	2/22/06	rude and obnoxious to students-- even in class. He's entirely self-absorbed. still, his lectures are interesting even if he's scary.
Stanford University	Lester Lawrence Lessig	2.5	2	Law	355	2	3	4	3	813422	7/6/08	I disagree with the others; I think they should consider the whole package, and walk a mile in his shoes. His contributions to law, policy and society are unparalleled. He cares deeply about his students. He cares deeply about the subjects. His lack of slickness (ala Grundfest) or pomposity (ala Brest) are attributes, not limitations.
Stanford University	Lester Lawrence Lessig	2.5	0	Law		5	2	2	3	813422	5/8/06	Felt like he read the material the night before, and was blessing us with his insights.
Stanford University	Pavle Levi	4.3	2	Film		5	5	5	5	815504	4/6/11	Professor Levi is what makes the film department come alive (although Stanford technically has no film department). He is probably the best film teacher I have ever encountered. Expressive like a preacher on the pulpit, he will make you inspired, and even nervous, as he is super smart and yes sexy too.
Stanford University	Pavle Levi	4.3	2	Film	180	1	5	5	5	815504	7/7/08	No Comments
Stanford University	Pavle Levi	4.3	2	Film	100	3	5	5	4	815504	2/28/06	Extremely captivating and passionate lecturer -- he chooses apt film clips, and makes the subject come alive. He is also EXTREMELY enthusiastic and personable if you come to his office hours -- he really encourages it. Plus, his accent is really hot and he's just generally super sexy. I want to marry this man.
Stanford University	Pavle Levi	4.3	0	Film	180	5	2	2	3	815504	3/16/11	nice guy. confusing rambles.
Stanford University	Pavle Levi	4.3	2	Film	230	4	5	4	4	815504	12/27/06	A fantastic lecturer and discussion leader who demonstrates a thorough knowledge of film theory/history/philosophy. Very helpful in conferences. I would highly recommend any class taught by him. Cool accent doesn't hurt. :)
Stanford University	Marc Levoy	5.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	3	358251	3/17/07	Awesome class. Take it. Everybody. Best was to get through the engineering/appscience GER EVER. SO COOL.

Stanford University	Michelle Landis-Dauber	2.0	0	Law	410	2	2	2	2	1150635	6/29/08	Poor, and unrepresentative of both Stanford and the legal profession generally. Obsessively foul-mouthed and extraordinarily closed-minded to anything but her world-view. Acolytes praise, but she is affirmatively _not_ a teacher.
Stanford University	Graham Larkin	4.0	2	Art History	295	3	5	3	5	797878	8/14/08	Nicest guy ever
Stanford University	Michel Latombe	5.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	353414	5/10/07	Awesome teacher... very clear and helpful

Stanford University	William Leben	2.5	0	Not Specified	110	5	3	1	3	262517	1/18/07	I took this class in the early 90s and his hearing was already shot - I cannot believe that he could still be teaching! A really nice guy, but he's gotta let it go.
Stanford University	William Leben	2.5	0	Not Specified	110	3	2	1	4	262517	2/28/06	I was going to declare in Linguistics until I took Leben's phonology course -- it was horrible! He was unclear, unhelpful, and, ironically, hard of hearing. In a LINGUISTICS class. That, and he talks like the Mad Hatter in Disney's "Alice in Wonderland". His class was a terrible experience.

Stanford University	Robert Leeson	2.0	0	Economics		5	2	2	3	882284	8/29/06	super super easy going. Econ 1 was kind of a joke with him. doent teach much so dont expect to learn anything from lectures. great way to boost your GPA and satisfy your Social Science GER
Stanford University	Jure  Leskovec	5.0	2	Computer Science	224	2	5	5	4	1801551	3/11/13	Fantastic teacher. Very enthusiastic.
Stanford University	Steven Levandosky	4.1	2	Mathematics	220	2	5	5	3	216860	11/28/05	great teacher
Stanford University	Steven Levandosky	4.1	2	Mathematics		1	3	4		216860	8/4/03	Very dry lectures but solid. Knows what he's talking about.
Stanford University	Steven Levandosky	4.1	2	Mathematics	103	3	5	4		216860	10/18/03	Very nics professor, though he could help out more with homework questions....
Stanford University	Steven Levandosky	4.1	2	Mathematics	103	3	4	3		216860	5/28/03	Levandosky is a solid lecturer. Definitely one of the few in the math department here.
Stanford University	Doron Levy	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	928942	7/10/07	Awesome teacher, definitely the students' favorite out of all the 51 lecturers. Very energetic, helpful, and is a great explainer.
Stanford University	Doron Levy	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	928942	12/27/06	No Comments
Stanford University	Doron Levy	4.4	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	4	928942	4/3/07	This guy is good for people with a strong mathematics base, but if you're coming into a class like 51 as a normal kid trying to fulfill a requirement, he sucks. He doesn't explain concepts in depth (to the point where you get that 'OH!' and understand) or explain the why or how behind concepts.
Stanford University	Doron Levy	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	928942	12/5/06	Great teacher who explains concepts clearly and effectively.
Stanford University	Martin Lewis	4.5	2	History	106	3	4	5	3	1146906	1/23/11	This guy is the best. Funny as hell and incredibly knowledgable. Definitely one of the most thought-provoking classes I've taken. Really useful too.
Stanford University	Andrei Linde	1.5	0	Physics		1	1	2	3	1346600	10/31/09	The subject is hard enough as it is, but he makes does a TERRIBLE job at teaching, after a few lectures I found it useless to attend. Pretty much I had to teach myself by reading the book. His tests are RIDICULOUS - the avg on the midterm was 49% and everyone was complaining
Stanford University	Rachel Lotan	4.5	2	Education	246	4	5	4	5	937031	12/16/06	Prof Lotan is clearly committed to teaching and supporting future teachers. This course was a hodge-podge of state-required content. Even so, it was usually interesting and relevant. The resource fair, particularly so. The atmosphere is a little too politically correct and more traditional/conservative viewpoints are muffled, if not silenced.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	578110	2/17/09	Best Math teacher I have ever had, and one of the best professors I have had at Stanford. He explains things in a way that makes it easy to understand.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	578110	3/13/08	Funny, interesting, generally awesome! He was really good at explaining stuff, even integrals. 52 didn't seem quite as hard as I thought it was going to. Take him if you can!
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	1	578110	3/6/07	super easy, super hot and super helpful. I love Marc. He's so easy going and clear. If you are not techie enough to start with 51 right away, you want to take math 40 series with him for sure.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	578110	5/17/06	Awesome, funny. Made a lot of jokes, which made the class fun.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	1	Mathematics		4	1	4	3	578110	3/29/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	578110	11/18/08	Mark is hilarious. He has some hilarious comments during lectures. I attend mostly for his jokes. Very clear and great teacher overall.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	578110	4/3/07	Amazing prof, can explain complex topics like they're obvious and logical, the textbook just confused me but he was incredible. Great guy.
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	578110	6/9/06	Confusing and goes off topic too much
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	3	578110	8/24/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Marc Lucianovic	3.9	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	3	578110	3/9/05	I've already had some calculus classes in the past, and if you have past experience, then these courses will be very easy. He goes through everything in lecture; if you don't understand, go to lecture! But if you do, then it's just coasting.
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	2	Engineering		1	5	5	5	463175	2/13/12	I attended Bruce's Systems Engineering Classes in 1968 ansd 1969 and it was the best course I ever did ever (graduate of Cambridge in agriculture, post grad economics, project evaluation and stats). His approach is what I have used during the whole of my professional life as a consultant working for leading agencies... and still going strong.
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	2	Engineering	279	3	5	5	5	463175	3/5/07	One of the best professors I had during 4 years at Stanford!
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	463175	6/26/06	Best professor I ever had!
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	0	Engineering	235	1	1	1	1	463175	9/22/04	the WORST ****ING TEACHER EVER. WORST CLASS, WORST PERSON. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ANYTHING, DOES NOT KNOW ENGINEERING FROM THE HOLE IN HIS ASS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, AT ALL COSTS!
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	0	Engineering	297	5	1	1	3	463175	6/23/07	Bruce is a flaming liberal. Be prepared to get a low grade if you try to make a conservative argument. This class is known as an easy A for jocks, but I got a B since I tried to propose social security reform. Unbelievable.
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	0	Engineering	235	5	1	1	3	463175	12/8/06	I would advise against taking any classes with Bruce. He has only the most limited understanding of course concepts, and when someone points out that he's done something wrong, he often says that students are "too stupid" to understand the material.
Stanford University	Bruce Lusignan	3.3	2	Engineering	103	3	5	5	5	463175	4/5/06	I disagree, Bruce Lusignan is willing to go to considerable lengths to help his students, truly a caring professor amidst self-absorbed colleagues who could care less about a student.
Stanford University	Jeannie Lythcott	4.5	2	Education	267	2	4	5	5	937017	12/16/06	Prof. Lythcott is an excellent teacher and is dedicated to making science education effective and fun. The lessons are very well organized and presented. Course expectations are a little unclear; it is absolutely required to meet with her during her office hours to do well in the class (something only suggested in the course outline).
Stanford University	Hari Manoharan	2.5	1	Physics	272	3	3	2	4	681408	9/14/06	Lectures were pretty much the same as just reading the textbook.
Stanford University	Nina Lin	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	236140	7/13/05	Lin lao shi is awesome! She's very cute and funny, and obviously cares about and can connect with her students. Her homework is difficult, but it keeps you up to speed and on your feet, and it's not difficult with the purpose of wanting you to do badly, its just so you learn what you need to.
Stanford University	Nina Lin	5.0	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	236140	12/28/04	I took this class with Nina and it was GREAT. Her fun teaching is the reason why attendance is always high in her classes. She makes you want to learn Taiwanese. It may seem easy but it takes some work to adjust to the language so be prepared to put in some time-it's not bad at all though. 5 stars!
Stanford University	Nina Lin	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5		236140	8/4/03	Nina teaches Taiwanese (listed as Southern Min, I think) and she's one of the best teachers I've had. The course material may not be incredibly hard but you can tell she cares about what she teaches and her students. Tries to adapt to her students' needs.
Stanford University	Nina Lin	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	4	236140	6/13/05	I took bilingual chinese with Lin Lao Shi. I thought it would be hard, since there was a quiz everyday in class, but the structure of the class kept me on track and I learned a lot. She's really nice and accomodating. Take her classes!
Stanford University	Nina Lin	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	4	236140	10/30/04	She so nice! Very helpful and understandable. Makes the language fun.
Stanford University	Tai-Ping Liu	1.2	0	Mathematics	104	1	1	1	3	957212	3/10/09	The most negligent professor I have ever had. Does not care about teaching. Does not care about students. Just read the ee263 course reader and skip this class.
Stanford University	Tai-Ping Liu	1.2	0	Mathematics	220	2	1	1	3	957212	2/8/07	Doesn't show up for office hours; not responsive to student needs; unlcear homework and exam questions. Seems uninterested in teaching anymore. I recommend against his course.
Stanford University	Tai-Ping Liu	1.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	957212	4/17/08	Incomprehensible during lecture, although definitely entertaining in a ridiculous way. He grades the exams himself-- with anal retention.
Stanford University	Garrett Logan	5.0	2	Economics	197	2	5	5	2	80254	1/19/06	One day he wore a 3 hole punched shirt to class. This guy puts the 'con' back in economics. He's such a great professor. He is currently a visitng Emeritus at UC Santa Barbara, but i hope he comes back to the Stanford homeland.

Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	2	English	243	3	5	5	5	313557	4/26/06	Dr Lunsford cares about her students, especially if you care to make an appointment with her. She's one of the rare professors who replies promptly and attentively to emails. Besides, she believes in the critical role of teachers in our schools today.
Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	2	English		3	5	5	4	313557	10/14/05	I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking; Andrea Lunsford is without a doubt one of the best professors at Stanford: wise, understanding, extremely knowledgeable, and very open-minded. And she's genuinely kind, caring, and unassuming--which I haven't found around so much. She's awesome. Andrea's like a breath of fresh air.
Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	0	English		3	1	2	2	313557	3/25/05	worst. advisor. ever. nice woman, but she didn't even remember that i was her advisee. that's not dedication.
Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	2	English		3	4	5	4	313557	11/18/05	Anyone who has a problem with Andrea Lunsford has a problem with me. Simply the most engaged, brilliant and helpful professor I've ever had - she's like the high school English teacher who first got you to believe in yourself, but in Stanford professor form.
Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	0	English		1	1	1	1	313557	9/6/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Andrea Lunsford	3.7	2	English		3	5	5	5	313557	3/22/05	Andrea is one of the best professors I've had. She's engaging and interested, passionate and brilliant. I heart Andrea.
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	2	Economics	102	2	4	5	1	291531	1/20/10	Despite the complaints about him, I thought he was extremely thorough, meticulous, and methodical in his teaching. The material isn't easy but he says everything at least 2 or 3 times. Some things like the OLS assumptions he went over almost every lecture. Loved the class, despite being frightened coming in.
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	2	Economics		5	5	5	5	291531	11/15/08	fantastic
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	0	Economics	102	1	3	1	2	291531	9/10/07	He cares about his students, he wants us to learn...but I could not for the life of me understand anything he was teaching.
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	0	Economics		2	2	1	1	291531	3/7/07	Terribly boring. Class was from 11:00-12:50, and he never even gave a moments thought to ever letting us out early or giving us a break in the middle. Problem sets are long and not graded in any timely fashion. Anything I learned in this class I learned from the textbook.
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	2	Economics	102	2	5	5	2	291531	3/14/09	Rocked my world
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	0	Economics	102	2	1	1	4	291531	4/27/08	Incomprehensible. The worst class I've been in.
Stanford University	Aprajit Mahajan	3.4	2	Economics	102	3	5	5	5	291531	3/12/07	He's the coolest prof on campus--and the most brilliant man I've met. He's gentle, helpful, and very thorough. In response to the comments above: do we need a break for a class that meets for UNDER 2 hours?
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History	273	3	5	5	5	13889	1/29/09	Mark is the most helpful and kindhearted professor I've had at Stanford. We will miss him when he leaves to Bhutan for good.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	0	History		3	1	1	4	13889	11/21/07	He's arrogant and full of himself. He's a great research prof, but in terms of teaching, he's terrible.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		3	4	2	2	13889	10/2/07	Dominates the conversation; right means to agree with him; awfully cute.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History	100	5	5	5	5	13889	2/24/07	GREAT TEACHER.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	0	History		3	1	3	3	13889	11/1/06	No Comments
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		3	2	4	5	13889	9/22/05	He's full of himself. definitely prefers male students, over female students. I'm a guy and I def felt the favoritism. His breathing always bugged the hek out of me... That said, he knows the material very well--he should, hes been teaching SLE for 20+ yrs! and there are always worse section leaders...
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		3	1	4	4	13889	12/30/04	oh, what a ****! Seems to enjoy the sound of his own voice. Liked, I think, more for his radical opinions than the quality of his teaching.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		2	3	2	4	13889	12/19/04	Agree he is highly intelligent but seems to prefer farming the hands-on teaching off to others.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		1	5	5		13889	8/15/03	The previous comment is a lie. Mark prefers highly intellectual students, and is the best SLE section leader.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		1	4	5		13889	1/26/03	No Comments
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		4	5	5	3	13889	9/25/08	honest and kind hearted. I think people who are scared or feel disassociated with him are probably only taking classes as a means to an end. the most helpful teacher I had at Stanford in my whole career.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		3	4	4	5	13889	10/30/07	Generally he's very helpful, but seems to be getting a little tired and/or bored at this point. Still love him though, he's a hottie!
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		4	4	3	4	13889	3/1/07	Mark has decades of experience but seems weary by now. In section when he asked qns, he usually had an answer in mind and would shoot us down until someone got the right answer. Most people were too intimidated to talk in section. At one-on-one meetings he was surprisingly kindly and grandfatherly. Just be respectful and he'll be good to you.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		5	5	5	5	13889	11/13/06	Mark is the best. He is seriously the most knowledgable person I've ever met, he's had so much life experience, it's amazing. I started the "I'm a Marksist" facebook group, check it out for Mark quotes, pictures and stories.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		4	5	5	4	13889	9/23/06	His home was always a home for his students. Underneath that unapproachable big and seemingly impatient man is a kind hearted and noble gentleman who is selflessly dedicated to his profession. He has saved a lot of troubled souls, and taught not only history, philosophy, art, psychology, sociology..., but more importantly lessons on life.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		3	3	4	5	13889	9/5/05	THE BEST SLE section leader by far. I've never learned so many alternate perspectives to what I believed were 'set in stone' historical/philosophical stances.
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		3	2	3	3	13889	12/26/04	I knew Mark over 25 years ago, and from the comments above, it sounds like he hasn't changed, Sycophantic male students: exactly!
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	2	History		2	5	5		13889	9/8/03	Immensely knowledgeable, and definitely approachable (just try! he's a ****cat, really)
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	0	History		2	1	3		13889	2/21/03	Unkind, unapproachable, uninterested, seems to prefer sycophantic male students
Stanford University	Mark Mancall	3.6	1	History		2	3	2		13889	9/4/01	A fascinating SLE prof, but not a terribly great teacher.
Stanford University	Horn Margo	3.5	2	Women's Studies		5	2	5	2	791404	2/7/06	A lovely person; she gives you a lot of space to express and discuss your own ideas
Stanford University	Lewis Martin	5.0	2	Geography	106	4	5	5	5	723469	3/13/07	Classes are very interesting and laid back. Lewis is a good prof, and makes the material especially engaging by drawing out student input. Even sections aren't bad at all, as you just talk about current affairs for 50 mins with a demographic expert.
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History	101	4	5	5	4	433670	12/27/11	Great professor! You'll be glad to take her class
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History	102	2	5	5	5	433670	3/19/09	Jody Maxmin is the single best teacher I have EVER had. Whether or not you like Art History, take her class! You will doubtlessly walk away a better person for having done so. Jody's enthusiasm and passion for her subject is contagious, and she really cares for her students. She is absolutely amazing, end of story.
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History		3	5	5	5	433670	2/2/05	jody maxmin is fabulous. she takes a great deal of interest in her classes, and her main goal is instructing undergraduates. she can inspire you like no other professor i had at stanford.
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History	102	2	5	5	5	433670	8/3/09	Most. Amazing. Teacher. Ever.
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History	203	2	5	5	5	433670	12/19/08	Jody Maxmin is the best teacher ever.
Stanford University	Jody Maxmin	5.0	2	Art History		3	5	5		433670	7/14/04	Most amazing professor I ever had, she is passionate and cares a lot about the students...she also brings in vitamins to class for the students!
Stanford University	Doug McAdam	5.0	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	2127	1/8/07	McAdam is amazing! He is very engaging because he is totally devoted to the material. In Soc. 1 we actually got to read works that he'd written. How interesting to go to class and hear from the author himself about how and why he wrote the material!
Stanford University	Doug McAdam	5.0	2	Political Science	110	1	5	5		2127	6/10/00	Great prof! Great class!
Stanford University	Doug McAdam	5.0	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	2127	11/29/06	SUPER SUPER SUPER GUY! Take his class, it's absolutely amazing. He is SO FUNNY. His grading is fair, and class is not too hard. SOC 1 is extremely interesting.
Stanford University	Alessandra McCarty	5.0	2	French & Italian		3	5	5	3	1547673	3/9/11	the teacher made this class so much fun! v. enthusiastic, always available and willing to help.

Stanford University	David Mease	5.0	2	Statistics	202	1	5	5	4	1160601	8/2/08	David is very knowledgeable about the subject area, and keeps the class interesting. Plus he's pretty cute, so coming to class is easy.
Stanford University	Daniel Medin	4.8	2	Humanities		3	5	5	4	823213	11/2/08	No Comments
Stanford University	Daniel Medin	4.8	2	Humanities		5	5	4	1	823213	3/23/06	Medin is bloody amazing. He's so enthusiastic. If you can get him for section leader, do it, no matter what ridiculous time it's at.
Stanford University	Daniel Medin	4.8	2	Humanities		4	5	5	5	823213	8/24/06	I had him for two different IHUM classes. So far he is my favorite teacher at Stanford! He is supportive and enthusiastic in every class. He tries to get those who are normally quiet to speak up because he wants everyone involved. Very fair grader. All negative comments he put on my papers I would have said myself. Really nice person. Approachable.
Stanford University	Christina Mesa	4.8	2	Humanities		3	5	4	5	627771	5/16/06	Christina is both brilliant and hilarious.
Stanford University	Christina Mesa	4.8	2	Humanities		2	5	5	5	627771	6/1/05	Christina is a wonderful teacher. She is very dedicated to her students and is willing to help them in any way she can.
Stanford University	Marina Marcos	4.5	2	Languages		3	5	4	5	1051007	6/18/09	She's a great teacher, but yes, she does tend to put students on the spot. She does it to everyone, though. Marina is willing to work outside of office hours and class, and she is more than willing to reconsider grades and whatnot.
Stanford University	Marina Marcos	4.5	2	Languages		3	5	4	3	1051007	11/8/07	First year Russian class. Marina puts students on the spot a lot, but it is actually very effective. She is a Native Russian speaker, which is also really great.
Stanford University	Ellen Markman	2.0	1	Psychology	141	2	2	4	5	627768	12/7/08	great lecturer, very knowledgeable
Stanford University	Ellen Markman	2.0	0	Psychology		1	1	1	5	627768	1/19/06	Avoid at all costs!
Stanford University	Ellen Markman	2.0	0	Psychology	141	1	2	2	3	627768	11/17/06	I don't know how this Professor manages to make child development boring/tedious, but she does.Lectures drag by.Tests seem unfair: Mostly covered journal articles, which she doesn't cover in class. A few questions from book readings, but they were random and didn't relate to what we learned in class--study the italicized vocab & you should be ok.

Stanford University	Christine McBride	4.5	2	English		2	5	4	3	1007876	7/12/07	She was awesome! We had her for a summer program on the Renaissance, and it was amazing!
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	2	5	4	5	363648	3/31/12	Moral Foundations of Capitalism was a great class! Professor McCaskey is very passionate and engaging. But be warned: he will cold call on you and if he suspects that you haven't kept up on the reading he will send you an email entitled "Are you keeping up?" Very very worth it though.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	3	5	5	3	363648	6/23/11	Professor McCaskey has lots of energy and enthusiasm for the class, which made me much more excited about the subject. He is incredibly helpful and always willing to work with students outside of class to make sure they understand the material. He also gave great essay feedback and helped us outside of class to improve our writing.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	3	5	5	4	363648	6/1/11	Moral Foundations of Capitalism with Prof. McCaskey is an excellent class.

Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	158	2	5	5	4	363648	3/19/10	Professor McCaskey opened my eyes to an entirely new world of that that I had not previously explored.

Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	220	1	5	5	5	363648	12/3/09	Professor McCaskey is by far and away the best professor at Stanford university. I have never taken such an enjoyable and interesting class. He is thoroughly devoted to teaching and every section is an exciting opportunity to hear his brilliant insights and learn from excellently lead discussions with your peers.

I would recommend this to anyone regardless of political persuasion.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	3	5	5	3	363648	6/8/11	Phenomenal teacher. I learned more in this class than I have in any other class at Stanford.

Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	3	5	5	5	363648	3/21/10	Professor McCaskey is everything a college class needs. His course provides a variety of viewpoints on ideas that are important to students and demands nothing but the best thinking from all. Best professor at Stanford thus far.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	3	5	5	5	363648	3/19/10	Professor McCaskey is an amazing professor. I took Moral Foundations of Capitalism, and it helped me formulate my own beliefs much more coherently. He handles discussions well, he brings a lot of passion to class, and his explanations are crystal clear. It was the best class I've taken so far, and I recommend that everyone try his classes.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	157	2	5	5	5	363648	3/12/10	Professor McCaskey's enthusiasm for course material was contagious. The course was well designed with a clear progression and development of central themes. I took a lot away from the course and highly recommend Dr. McCaskey to other students. He's one of the best professors I've had at Stanford.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	220	2	5	4	4	363648	12/4/09	This class was great. McCaskey knows his subject, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Even students who had no prior interest in 19th century philosophy of science seemed engaged and excited. Overall, a great experience. Take a class from this guy.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	154	4	5	5	4	363648	4/15/09	Prof. McCaskey is amazing. This class was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and most of that is due to his way of teaching and engaging students in meaningful and insightful discussions. Awesome!
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	154	2	5	5	5	363648	3/13/09	this man was enthusiastic and passionate about the course. the course covered 2500 years of the history of science and logic, and he was versed in every topic of discussion. he is as likable as he is intelligent. if you like the history of science and want to read Newton, Galileo, Aristotle, Heisenberg, Copernicus, and others, this is the course!!
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	154	3	5	4	3	363648	1/2/08	Prof McCaskey was awesome, especially with the small discussion class we had he was great at leading our talks and really emphasized student involvement. The class got really passionate, in large part because he relayed his own enthusiasm to us. I'd love to take another class with him, or just the same one again!
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History	154	3	5	5	4	363648	12/17/07	Prof. McCaskey is extremely knowledgeable, and his class was really cool and interesting. His standards are high but fair. His real strength in class is leading excellent discussions which are engaging and informative and, most of all, really bring the readings to life.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History		3	5	5	3	363648	3/12/05	He's a great teacher and makes you really care about what you're learning. Much more exciting than most history classes. Workload can be heavy at times, especially when there's a paper due. Papers are graded hard but fair; the class grading system is nicely structured. Be prepared to participate!
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History		3	5	5	4	363648	5/16/05	Excellent teacher. Very excited about the material, very interested in what the students have to say. The best class I have taken here.
Stanford University	John McCaskey	4.9	2	History		3	5	5		363648	3/12/04	Excellent Teacher. Inspires learning and curiousity. Eager to help each individual student.
Stanford University	Robert McGinn	3.8	2	Not Specified	115	3	5	5	3	463818	10/17/07	He's good!
Stanford University	Robert McGinn	3.8	0	Not Specified	115	5	1	3	1	463818	11/28/05	What a waste of time! McGinn is so pompous and awful. But hey, it is easy!
Stanford University	Robert McGinn	3.8	2	Not Specified	110	3	5	4	5	463818	8/31/06	He was also my advisor. This class was one of my favorites. Prof. McGinn does goes off on tangents sometimes, but they are always interesting. Very, very dedicated to teaching, his students, and the STS program.
Stanford University	Robert McGinn	3.8	2	Not Specified	103	3	3	4	5	463818	9/5/05	Very enthusiastic, energetic.... vague and confusing at times, entertaining always. Very interesting course material.
Stanford University	Zena Meadowsong	4.5	2	Humanities		4	4	5	4	944880	12/6/07	Highly recommended. Her sections are work-intensive, but very helpful in clarifying the lectures. AND there are snacks at every section (student provided). Yum. AND she's the quirkiest and cutest TF ever.
Stanford University	Zena Meadowsong	4.5	2	Humanities		3	5	5	3	944880	1/7/07	After hearing many horror stories about IHUM TFs and how miserable they can make section, I loved having Zena as my TF. Very interesting, intelligent, relaxed, and fun. Also quite helpful out of class. I would highly recommend her.

Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	4	574511	8/31/06	The only examples he does in class are directly from the book, and ridiculously easy. Therefore when you do the hard problems on the problem set or on the test, you are completely underprepared. The TA's are generally bad, though a few are good. Meckes is pretty helpful if you come in for office hours, though.
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	574511	3/1/06	Mark Meckes is not only an excelent professor, but also funny and hot as hell. All of us girls think he is sexy with his sneaky tricks.
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	574511	9/10/05	Meckes was the best teacher I had all year. He made math super easy and his exams were impossibly easy. The practice exams he gave right before exams were exact replicas of the real exams, only the numbers were changed. It was impossible to get anything but an A in his class. And he was super nice and helpful!
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	1	Mathematics		1	2	4	5	574511	2/27/05	Meckes seems nice, but really he's the DEVIL. He only explains the basics in class and expects you to figure everything else out yourself. Exams are completely different from homework and practice exams. His curve is awful-- the average grade is a C. He blames all problems on students, not him.
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	1	574511	3/12/06	You don't have to go to lecture if you read the book. That's all he does. Take the text and write on the chalk board, and explain in verbatim from the textbook. You just take more notes. (He also likes to write periods after everything.) The TAs do suck. All of them have thick accents.
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	574511	12/6/05	An awesome teacher. Explains essentials in class, but that is why you buy the book. More than willing to help during is office hours and is very approachable. His TAs do suck, especially Manuel
Stanford University	Mark Meckes	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	574511	3/24/05	I agree with everything said in the other rating... Meckes expects you to learn everything yourself, and he is not open to the fact that maybe he does a poor job teaching the class... we hardly saw any examples in lecture... also, his TA's were terrible, especially the one I had (Ian)
Stanford University	Peter Michelson	1.2	0	Physics		2	1	1	1	440100	10/27/10	Hes horrible. Awful. Practice exams have no relation to actual exams. probably because he typically teaches the 40s series. Also extremely dull.
Stanford University	Peter Michelson	1.2	0	Physics		3	2	1	4	440100	12/20/06	Not the most interesting guy... class is hard to sit through.

Stanford University	Peter Michelson	1.2	0	Physics		2	2	1	3	440100	9/5/06	None to good. Good for insomnia.
Stanford University	Peter Michelson	1.2	0	Physics		2	1	1	4	440100	3/5/06	A horrible teacher, just sits there and clicks through inscrutable powerpoint slides. Avoid him at all costs.

Stanford University	Todor Milanov	3.2	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	2	946193	1/9/07	An interesting professor. Sick Russian accent. Incredibly neat - almost to the point of obsessive compulsive. Teaches quickly, even when students' eyes have glazed over. But that may be every Math 51 professor.
Stanford University	Kimberly Moekle	4.2	1	English		4	3	2	3	881810	12/7/12	She's your typical California save-the-world tree hugger who has lost touch with reality. Her class is very politically biased- she can't even hold a rational discussion about clean coal,natural gas solutions, or economic incentives. Profitable business are evil. If you think we can power the world with windmills, you guys will get along.
Stanford University	Kimberly Moekle	4.2	2	English		5	5	5	2	881810	8/29/07	She is AMAZING. Nicest teacher I have had by far. She is a great teacher and grades very fair.

Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry	130	3	1	2	2	503861	2/16/09	He as a resource was completely unhelpful. TAs didn't seem to know what was going on either. His tests tend to be almost exactly the same, so check previous terms' tests. This was the first science class I'd ever been in where the entire lecture hall unanimously responded "NO" when a professor asked, "Did that make sense?"
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	2	Chemistry		2	3	4	2	503861	10/19/07	If you listen in class, do your work, and have half a brain, you'll do fine in Moylan's class. Many of my classmates were whiny pre-med students who wanted to learn ONLY what's on the exams and nothing more. If you're so lazy and want everything spelled out and spoon fed to you, why the hell did you apply to Stanford??? A's are EARNED,you whiners!
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry		3	1	2	3	503861	8/29/07	Moylan is extremely high on himself and was didn't seem to care at all about the students in this class.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	2	Chemistry	174	2	3	4	1	503861	4/1/07	Way too many assignments: 3 10pg lab reports, 4 20min orals, 2 midterms, 2 5pg lab tour reports. One or two assignments due per week - made it hard to keep up in other classes. On the plus side, he is a better teacher than our other chem profs, and the grading wasn't impossible: the curve was: 1 A+, 7 A's, 1 A-, 7 B's, 1 C, 1 F.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry	130	1	1	3	4	503861	8/23/06	Moylan is the worst teacher the world has ever seen. He gets pissed off if you ask him a question.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry	130	3	1	2	4	503861	12/16/05	Avoid this teacher AT ALL COSTS.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	1	Chemistry	130	2	3	3	3	503861	10/5/05	Although did do this cool Snape-impersonation thing at the beginning of Chem 36 last year, he's annoying.

Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry		1	2	1	1	503861	12/14/04	The chem labs are very very bad classes, and Moylan's a terrible lecturer. The lectures make no sense and are basically useless. Don't even go. If you get a bad lab TA, you're screwed. I worked my ass off in Chem 36 and still got a B. Then I learned and took Chem 130 CR/NC and did almost no work.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	3	503861	8/28/08	this class is pretty alright. the lectures by moylan are really great, but the lab TAs are confused and there are extremely unclear directions and expectations for the lab period. they grade the labs way too tough, but know what you're doing and you'll be fine.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry		2	1	2	2	503861	9/9/07	By far, the worst professor that I have had at Stanford. I am no longer interested in chemistry at all as a profession.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	1	Chemistry	174	1	2	3	4	503861	8/16/07	The class is too much work. You do learn a lot though and in the end it is worth it. I liked it. This must be taken with a grain of salt because I also enjoy dressing up in latex and being whipped. He is not a bad lecturer. Unfortunately he does not lecture on everything you need to know to complete the lab reports, the rationale being that you nee
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry	174	1	1	1	1	503861	3/10/07	Moylan is a terrible teacher; avoid him and this class if at all possible. First, the class is a ridiculous amount of work - more like 10 units, not 4 - and second, he doesn't teach anything. So you're expected to teach yourself all the theory for everything. And you're at a major disadvantage if you haven't taken 153 - so be warned!
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	0	Chemistry	130	1	1	1	5	503861	6/18/06	CHEM 36 isn't that bad, but 130 is hell. Moylan is the worst teacher I have ever had. If you try to ask him anything he will get pissed off.
Stanford University	Chris Moylan	2.0	2	Chemistry		5	4	5	2	503861	10/21/05	This class was pretty easy. I did my work and got an A period. The exams are super easy. Great lecturer, dressed up as Harry Potter first day.

Stanford University	 Michaelson	2.6	0	Science		3	3	1	5	13886	3/29/06	Michaelson is probably the worse professor in the world. He's knowledgable and smart yet not made for teaching.

Stanford University	H. Lyman Miller	4.5	2	Political Science	140	4	3	5	3	544632	12/28/04	Prof. Miller knows his stuff on China. He's a Hoover Fellow too. During class, he even bust out with some Mandarin from time to time to emphasize what he was lecturing on. His class was based on essays but that doesn't make it a piece of cake-he expects quality. Recommended class! :)
Stanford University	John Mitchell	3.0	2	Computer Science	242	4	5	4	4	268252	9/29/05	Funny anecdotes from research work. His textbook on programming languages does a good job of giving you a taste of many different styles of language, something most undergrads never get. Lectures are okay, but you have to do the reading to really get it. This class got me interested in learning more about the languages.
Stanford University	John Mitchell	3.0	0	Computer Science	242	3	2	2		268252	10/26/03	His slides suck, he's boring, and the book he wrote sucks too.
Stanford University	John Mitchell	3.0	1	Computer Science	149	4	2	3	4	268252	11/24/04	Uber-boring. Dry monotonous lecture reading from equally dry monotonous slides. He's brilliant and knowledgable, no doubt, but that sadly does not come out in his lectures.

Stanford University	Andrew Ng	4.0	2	Computer Science	229	2	5	5	5	545784	11/8/12	Professional Ng is an amazing lecturer, absolutely top notch. His notes are extremely detailed and refined. But going to his class is still a plus, he's clear, to the point and extremely good with giving examples for anything that might be fuzzy in the notes. The class is not easy however - at least for me, the homework really requires a lot work.
Stanford University	Andrew Ng	4.0	2	Computer Science	229	3	4	5	4	545784	12/20/11	Absolutely amazing! Genuinely interested in the subject, explains concepts with clarity, uses excellent examples and focuses on what's important. Usually you'd need to meet a professor in person to iron out problems and understanding. He managed to teach via lecture videos and STILL got through to most people. Absolutely amazing!
Stanford University	Andrew Ng	4.0	2	Computer Science	229	1	5	5	5	545784	1/11/11	Very well-organized class on a hard topic. Great lecture notes. Freedom to work on a cutting-edge project.
Stanford University	Andrew Ng	4.0	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	545784	1/7/09	This guy's a legend!
Stanford University	Andrew Ng	4.0	0	Computer Science	229	1	2	1	5	545784	12/4/06	His lecture notes are very clear, but he's a terrible lecturer in person. He mumbles and writes equations on the board without differentiating useful ones from algebraic derivations. I'm very serious when I say that he draws arrows labeled "magic" when he gets tired of explaining things.

Stanford University	Dragos Oprea	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	3	1072458	12/11/07	One of the best math professors I've had yet. Explained concepts so clearly that it made going to class 5 days a week worth it (I have a tendency of skipping math lectures since most teachers are incomprehensible). However, he does not go by the textbook since the text for this class is utterly incomprehensible to students without a PhD in math.
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	4	5	5	5	1038150	3/29/11	He's an outstanding teacher.
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	5	5	4	5	1038150	7/8/10	good prof
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	3	5	5	5	1038150	2/24/08	Excellent instructor with a great writing style. His notes bring great clarity to the subject of signal processing. Also has a good sense of humor.
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	3	5	5	1	1038150	12/30/10	Very good big picture explanations. Great notes. Good sense of humor.
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	1	5	5	5	1038150	6/10/09	Great Lectures!!!
Stanford University	Brad Osgood	4.8	2	Engineering	261	3	4	5	5	1038150	10/15/07	really cool prof. clear teaching. intresting classes, but lots of homeworks.
Stanford University	Ozalp Ozer	5.0	2	Management	260	3	5	5	3	483110	5/19/06	Most handsome. I am in love with him
Stanford University	Rina Panigrahy	3.5	2	Computer Science		1	3	4	3	862184	6/29/06	A tough teacher! I had trouble understanding through his accent. He will make you work hard!
Stanford University	Boris Murmann	4.3	2	Engineering	214	2	4	5	4	970115	9/30/08	I took ee214, ee215, and ee315 with Boris as an audit student. I work in industry and wanted a refresher on all things analog. Boris is such an excellent teacher and teaches things relevant to the real world, not just from theory or textbook point of view. Boris is one of the few, and I mean very few, profs who could excel in industry.
Stanford University	Boris Murmann	4.3	2	Engineering	214	2	4	4	4	970115	3/27/07	Prof Murmann emphasizes practical design methods that can be used in practice. I really learnt a lot in EE214 and his explanations are pretty good on the whole. My only grouse is that too much material is cramped into the class; but that is typical of many classes in Stanford EE anyway.
Stanford University	Boris Murmann	4.3	2	Engineering	315	1	5	4	4	970115	6/13/08	Instructor is very organized and interesting, but the grade you got but be very disappointing. Even if you do well in homeworks and midterm project, you will get a B if you score 50% in the final.

Stanford University	Oyekunle Olukotun	3.8	1	Computer Science	315	3	1	4	3	1230567	5/26/10	Knowledgeable and completely apathetic. I would ask him very fundamental questions via email and he would never reply. The only way to get a response seemed to be call or walk to his office directly. His lectures were good but then he was off the clock. He is probably tenured.
Stanford University	Oyekunle Olukotun	3.8	2	Computer Science	315	5	5	5	5	1230567	12/17/08	He is really really great.
Stanford University	Richard Ontiveros	4.8	2	Music	121	1	4	5	2	1074826	9/8/10	I thought this was an easy "A", boy was I wrong. He kicked everyone's butt and was very good. He could be more detailed but I guess if he did it would be a long class.
Stanford University	Richard Ontiveros	4.8	2	Music		5	5	5	5	1074826	12/13/07	He is great. I have never had so much fun learning music history. I didn't I would like it and it was a blast. He was strict but he earned everyone's respect.

Stanford University	Richard Ontiveros	4.8	2	Music	112	1	4	5	2	1074826	8/21/08	Doc O. was awasome. He was very harsh sometimes but he did the job. I was not sure about him because he was so young but he lived up to the expectations.
Stanford University	Richard Ontiveros	4.8	2	Music		5	5	5	5	1074826	12/13/07	He is great. I have never had so much fun learning music history. I didn't I would like it and it was a blast. He was strict but he earned everyone's respect.

Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	2	Science		3	4	3	3	105632	6/12/06	Really nice. His enthusiasm in lecture makes physics actually bearable. He loves doing demos and gives u lecture notes every class, huge bonus.

Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	1	Science		1	2	3		105632	8/4/03	His lecture notes are kind of illegible and his lecture can wander off. Likes to mention his award in class a lot. Approachable, though.

Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	0	Science		1	2	1	1	105632	8/20/08	he's a grandfatherly professor who means well, but he's totally incomprehensible and his lecture is just babbling/regurgitating lecture notes. at least for me, it was really rough, plus 43/e&m is the toughest of the 40s series... i'd really avoid him if you can
Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	2	Science		5	5	5	5	105632	8/8/06	Very nice, caring, helpful person--very smart--thank you
Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	0	Science		2	1	1	4	105632	8/10/05	Notes are incomprehensible. Did not make sense in any of the lectures at all. The class only made sense once I did my problem sets, otherwise was completely useless. Has a strange sense of humor though, has a flair for being theatrical and goofy. The final was suprisingly easy, said it was his "christmas present" for us.
Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	2	Science		4	4	3	4	105632	1/4/05	he reminds me of my grandfather. i loved it
Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	2	Science		2	5	4		105632	4/1/04	Shows a lot of concern for students if you approach him, though that's made rather difficult by the horde of students fawning over him during office hours... dare I call them Nobel groupies?
Stanford University	Douglas Osheroff	3.1	0	Science		2	2	2		105632	11/16/03	difficult class, made more so due to confusing, diffuclt, arrogant professor.

Stanford University	John Pauly	4.2	1	Engineering	102	2	3	2		236143	8/4/03	Prof Pauly basically straight from the lecture notes. He tends to be a soft spoken lecturer so it can lull people to sleep. Nice guy overall though.
Stanford University	John Pauly	4.2	2	Engineering	469	5	5	5	4	236143	8/7/06	Best Class I've ever taken from the best prof.

Stanford University	B. Howard Pearson	4.5	2	Law		3	4	4		133764	2/18/03	Fair, could be more enthusiastic in class
Stanford University	Otila Perales	3.2	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	887640	11/13/06	Chelo is the best. I love this woman. She is the long lost Peruvian aunt I never had. I stayed with the 2nd year Spanish track to have her all year and when my section got cancelled 3rd qtr she did a 4 unit independent study with me w/o pay! And she got it to count for the 2 year IR requirement. We regularly had dinner together, she's amazing.
Stanford University	Otila Perales	3.2	0	Languages		2	2	1	5	887640	9/6/06	Class was about culture, but she teaches a poli sci spanish course and focused on that. Not focused on learning language (speaking, understanding) but more on reading/politics. Very intense/intimidating. VERY inaccessible as an individual and is very inflexible. Only take if you are planning on doing poli sci in spanish and are not intimidated.
Stanford University	William Petig	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	694498	12/17/09	Petig is one of the finest teachers I've ever had. He keeps class extremely entertaining, but keeps you on your toes and makes you work hard. Very clear explanations.
Stanford University	William Petig	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	694498	3/17/08	Amazing teacher, funny and entertaining but also the best teacher in the German Department. You will learn your stuff without even noticing it. Not hard or strict but you still learn and have fun. Its never hard going to class, there is never a dull moment. Very good at explaining. Best Professor at Stanford.
Stanford University	William Petig	5.0	2	Languages		2	5	5	4	694498	8/31/06	Continuing studies course (not sure it is actually '01'): very friendly and approachable, planned gatherings outside of the class too, really liked it.
Stanford University	William Petig	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	694498	2/22/09	Petig is the most helpful and understanding professor I have ever met. Not only is he a great teacher, but he also has a great sense of humor.
Stanford University	William Petig	5.0	2	Languages		2	5	5	4	694498	8/18/07	One of my favorite profs!!! Insanely funny, and always very helpful. Willing to meet, plans out of class events for fun, and always has hilarious stories and sayings. If you see the name Petig, take the class. Grading is very fair, not easy, but def. not hard. If you give effort, you'll earn your A.
Stanford University	Peggy Phelan	4.0	2	Theater		1	3	4	4	698483	1/3/07	Class scared me; my limitation, not Prof Phelan's. V. competitive, difficult, invitation to philosophicasl extremes, knew I was not up to it. In the end. I want a simple life. I want my mind to stay attached to my body. We have -- after all -- and if we are lucky -- "three scores years and ten" -- unless we live in Zambia (life expectancy = 37 yrs)
Stanford University	Peggy Phelan	4.0	2	Theater		3	4	5	5	698483	9/15/05	exhilerating, exhausting, encyclopaedic. don't go into this class expecting an easy ride. but you never know, it might just change your ilfe.
Stanford University	Serge Plotkin	2.6	2	Computer Science	261	3	4	4	4	450003	3/1/13	He is a good Professor. He knows the material and he cares to teach them right. The material itself is not easy though.

Stanford University	Serge Plotkin	2.6	0	Computer Science	161	1	2	2	2	450003	12/4/12	Belittles students' questions during class.
Stanford University	Serge Plotkin	2.6	2	Computer Science	261	2	5	5	4	450003	3/28/06	One of the best theory classes I have ever had (and I had quite a few). Though material is not trevial, he managed to retain my attention throughout entire class. I took the follow-up class as well. Very, very good!
Stanford University	Serge Plotkin	2.6	1	Computer Science	161	2	3	2	1	450003	11/11/04	An ok teacher, doesn't really sympathize with students.
Stanford University	Richard Powers	5.0	2	Theater	156	4	5	5	5	658932	8/31/06	Very helpful, very involved in dance history, great teacher. Has a big "following" on campus - partly responsible for vibrant social dance community at Stanford.

Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	108	3	4	4	5	247367	4/2/06	He tells a horrible pun every lecture to break the monotony, never phased by the pained reactions of the students in the class.

Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	101	2	5	5	2	247367	5/22/12	Hats off Teach. You are extremely well at what you do. Keep it up. Course I took was CS101 from coursera.com
Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	101	4	5	5	3	247367	5/21/12	Really fun instructor and you can tell he is passionate and loves what he does for a living.
Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	108	1	5	5	5	247367	4/19/11	I took CS108 and also a java seminar on internet programming with Nick. Great teacher. CS108 is very hard.

Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	108	2	5	5	5	247367	12/19/05	Very enthusiastic teacher, even when the material sucks. And he writes a lot of the very helpful and clear CS 106/107/108 handouts/assignments.
Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	247367	8/30/05	I rate Parlante as the best instructor I've had. His classes and teachings made me choose my profession, and have shaped my programming philosophy

Stanford University	Nick Parlante	4.4	2	Computer Science	108	1	5	4		247367	9/9/03	I love Parlante's classes. He is an excellent teacher just like the other lecturers, but he has a quirkiness and bizarre humor that makes his lectures all the more fun.

Stanford University	John Pencavel	1.5	0	Economics		1	2	1	4	864027	7/7/06	His lectures are as boring as they get.
Stanford University	William Perry	4.0	2	International Studies	193	5	3	5	5	620775	3/20/07	2 Take Home Exams (super easy wikipedia style). 1 essay which you turn in twice for regrade. All lectures online! Speaks clearly. Famous guest lecturers. Second half of quarter not as interesting as the first half. Very popular class. Has a huge staff working for him. he or guest lecturer grades your essay personally
Stanford University	William Perry	4.0	2	International Studies	193	3	3	5	3	620775	5/16/05	It's hard to rate his helpfulness or easiness, because he wasn't really involved in grading. But he's the FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE! Great lecturer, amazing experiences, very willing to share what he knows. As far as I can tell, the man is responsible for modern US military strategy.
Stanford University	William Perry	4.0	2	International Studies	193	3	4	4	5	620775	5/21/06	Prof. Perry tells very good stories of his past, although his interpreations of modern political strategy and military affairs are skewed at best. In particular, his interpretation of the 'Agreed Framework' with N.Korea is particularly biased. However, all-in-all a great course and fantastic resource.

Stanford University	Joel Peterson	4.5	2	Business		3	5	5	3	551220	1/9/05	Mr.Peterson is a incredible teacher. He is funny, kind and intresting. I have met his kids and they just seem to love him so much. He is a active Mormon. Most of his family lives in utah.
Stanford University	Dmitri Petrov	4.0	2	Biology		3	4	4	4	680902	12/27/06	He's really insightful and dedicated to his teaching..all around wonderful prof...be sure to take notes in his class

Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	103	4	4	4	4	203922	12/3/10	He's clear, enthusiastic and super likeable. I loved his course.
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203922	3/6/09	Great professor, extremely clear in presentation and very likable in person. However, it wouldn't hurt if he made his students break a sweat once in a while -- his classes are too easy.
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	4	2	203922	1/16/08	i loved Bob he was awesome!!!
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	103	4	5	5	3	203922	12/19/05	Groovy guy, fun to watch.

Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5	4	203922	9/23/09	One of the best classes I took at Stanford. Bob was a great!
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	0	Computer Science	103	2	1	3	5	203922	2/15/08	I learned nothing from him. He went through a problem, explaining each step in clear detail & the reason behind each step so I remembered them, until getting to the final "answer". The next day after class, he said, "by the way, the answer we got was wrong because the steps we took were wrong". He wouldn't explain further. Not a good teacher.
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	103	2	4	5	3	203922	3/27/06	I really liked this class and Plummer is really good, however I got a bad grade. Make sure you do all the hw's . . .
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	4	203922	5/1/05	He's called Easy Bob for a reason, but nevertheless, an excellent lecturer and very approachable.
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5		203922	6/9/03	How could you not like Bob? He's awesome.
Stanford University	Robert Plummer	4.3	2	Computer Science	106	3	4	5		203922	5/3/03	Plummer is awesome, and his slides are so clear and concise.

Stanford University	Rush Rehm	4.5	2	Theater		1	4	4	1	542948	3/10/11	You will learn a lot from Rush Rehm. He has radical ideas and discussions are always heated, interesting, and enlightening. Although he assigns a large workload and grades hard, I learned more in his class than in all my other classes combined that quarter. Therefore, I will never regret my decision to take the class.
Stanford University	Rush Rehm	4.5	2	Theater		2	5	5	5	542948	9/8/06	Awesome. Rush is brilliant. Any chance you get, take his class.
Stanford University	Rush Rehm	4.5	2	Theater		1	5	5	4	542948	12/15/09	Rush is a very interesting prof, and he taught an interesting class. He is very helpful and a nice guy. But there is an extreme amount of work (a book assigned per class) and he grades hard. People say that fuzzies have it easier and have less work that techies, but Rush tries to make that not true.
Stanford University	Rush Rehm	4.5	2	Theater		3	4	4	5	542948	12/25/04	Awesome class - Rehm knows a lot about liberal interpretations of the media, gov't etc. - highly recommended
Stanford University	Veronika Reinhold	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	962977	3/4/07	Veronika is a great spanish teacher. She is very helpful and nice. She explains everything very clearly and she tries to plan fun activities to keep us interested. I liked her so much I took her class for Spanish 1A and 2A.
Stanford University	Deborah Rhode	2.7	2	Law		4	3	4	2	133752	8/17/10	Lazy. Basically turns the class over to students to teach and uses student final papers to supplement her casebook. The cliche of a liberal who means well, but is hopelessly stuck in her white, middle-class world view. Also, thinks very highly of herself.
Stanford University	Deborah Rhode	2.7	1	Law		5	2	3	3	133752	1/26/05	brrr...
Stanford University	Deborah Rhode	2.7	2	Law		2	3	4		133752	2/18/03	Not very approachable
Stanford University	Deborah Rhode	2.7	1	Law		4	2	4	1	133752	3/28/08	Boring, and quite enamored with her own accomplishments (she loves to cite herself).
Stanford University	Deborah Rhode	2.7	0	Law		5	1	1		133752	2/28/03	She is awful
Stanford University	Cecilia Ridgeway	1.7	0	Sociology	120	4	2	2	2	631468	12/6/06	She is a terrible lecturer. It is difficult to hear her at times, and it is difficult to discern what is really important. She doesn't use the board enough. Reading is dense and superfluous. I do not recommend a class with her.
Stanford University	Cecilia Ridgeway	1.7	0	Sociology	142	3	2	1	4	631468	6/10/05	Spectacularly poor lecturer; stutters and stammers. That would all be fine if the curriculum was not so full of indoctrination in an ultrafeminist agenda. I consider myself a feminist, but the readings cited in the class have such a blatant anti-male bent that made this the most biased class I've taken at Stanford. Avoid Professor Ridgeway.
Stanford University	Cecilia Ridgeway	1.7	0	Sociology	142	2	1	2	5	631468	10/14/05	Reading material is not updated, and studies revolve around white participants--not enough diversity. For exams, you have to write the way she or her "grad assts" want you to write--but you don't know what that is until you get your paper back! I don't recommend a class with her.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	601	2	5	5	3	203930	4/6/13	Reason why I understood recursion and algorithm!!
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	5	203930	1/18/07	Smart guy! Very passionate about teaching and you can really sense he actually likes teaching undergrads. Programming assignments are fun - they can get rather time consuming towards the end of the quarter.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5	3	203930	8/31/06	Loved this class! Very dedicated to teaching, willing to help students. Also took 201 - Computers, Ethics, and Social Responsibility from him, loved that as well.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	203930	10/5/05	I took his "visions of utopia" introsem and it was tons of fun. there was a lot of reading, but eric is really cool and always structured class well. not to mention, he invited us over to his house to watch the movie of 1984 and eat a full home-cooked dinner. it was greatly appreciated, especially as a rest from dining hall food. he's just a really cool guy.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	2	203930	3/16/05	Eric Roberts is an amazing professor!
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	3	3	5		203930	3/5/04	His lectures are very clear and helpful. Class wasn't a transformative experience or anything, but was reasonably fun and interesting.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5		203930	7/20/03	What a crazy beard
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	0	Computer Science		1	1	1		203930	5/11/03	Has sung with the New York City opera. Ask him
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	203930	4/19/11	Eric Roberts is a great teacher, and his textbooks are top notch.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	203930	12/26/06	Eric Roberts really did a good job in this class. He managed to make the class fun and interactive and I enjoyed his lectures. He tought me the IHUM Technological Visions of Utopia.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	4	3	203930	4/13/06	Extremely nice man - interesting lecturer with a warm personality.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5	4	203930	9/29/05	Great professor, committed guy. The reason I'm a CS major.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	0	Computer Science	106	3	2	2		203930	3/9/04	terrible course once you get past a certain point; for me it was like hitting a conceptual wall, and he just couldn't explain it anymore. he's a really nice guy tho.
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	1	Computer Science	106	1	1	5		203930	8/7/03	He lectures well, but when you ask him for help, he talks in metaphors and high-level language. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO MY ASSIGNMENT
Stanford University	Eric Roberts	4.1	1	Computer Science	106	3	3	3		203930	5/28/03	Decent, but overrated.
Stanford University	Channing Robertson	4.8	2	Engineering		4	4	4	3	132743	12/20/11	I watched his lectures on youtube. I'm not a stanford student, but looking at what he does in class, he loves to mess around with people, but he's good.
Stanford University	Channing Robertson	4.8	2	Engineering		2	4	5	5	132743	8/31/05	Amazing professor. Take Intro to ChemE even if you aren't majoring in engineering.

Stanford University	Channing Robertson	4.8	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	132743	3/3/05	Probably the best professor at Stanford. After taking his class, I am completely dedicated to the Chemical Engineering major. His teaching style is exceptionally engaging, his lectures are laced with lots of funny stories. I can't wait to TA for him this spring.
Stanford University	Channing Robertson	4.8	2	Engineering	120	2	5	5		132743	4/6/04	Best Teacher at stanford!!
Stanford University	Michael Predmore	5.0	2	Humanities	336	2	5	5	5	886901	9/5/06	Dr. Predmore is one of the most knowledgeable and engaging professors I have encountered during my years @ Stanford. He loves Spain and its literature and it comes across in his lectures. He is also an extremely considerate and kind professor with students, because he truly cares if they are learning or not.
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History		3	4	5	3	28392	8/17/11	One of the two best professors I had at Stanford. Rakove is a great lecturer, and a very good writer. Take his classes.
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History		4	4	5	5	28392	12/24/06	Dr. Rakove is really one of our best resources at Stanford University. Between him and Dr. Lawrence Friedman at the Law School, Stanford offers wonderful opportunities for studies in US legal history. This class was my first inn history, and also a major change of direction in my academic career - persuaded me to abandon chemistry.
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History	150	2	5	5	3	28392	10/21/05	Excellent, conversational, engaging lecturer - makes the material really interesting. Clearly very passionate about what he does.
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History		2	3	4		28392	7/5/04	Very sharp, fair, but "his way or the highway"....

Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History	165	1	4	4	5	28392	5/21/06	Prof. Rakove is arrogant, self-aggrandizing, and indulgent. However, he is brilliant, and only subtly reminds you of his Pulitzer every now and again. He's a phenomenal resource on the Revolution and Constitutionalism. In class, don't just bend over and take it, put up a fight and you'll have a great time.
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History		2	5	5	3	28392	7/8/05	He was my advisor during his first year (1980). My only two C's came from him. The most articulate lecuture I've ever heard. Just the lectures are worth the prices of admission. Kind of caught of in grammar and kind of stuffy -- fits that "east coast prep" stereotype. But then again, that's the charm! Easily my favorite at Stanford.GoCubs RW R
Stanford University	Jack Rakove	4.4	2	History		3	5	5		28392	2/19/03	Unbelievable retention of names and comments
Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	247	3	5	4	4	693288	6/12/10	weird how these keep getting deleted, but as with my rating for jurafsky in the same seminar -- great class, great prof, great learning experience. why does stanford always let the good ones go?
Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	205	2	5	5	3	693288	10/24/08	He has a brilliant mind, and genuine soul, he is funny, kind, and a generous, caring teacher, he is also so humble and honest, and this is so refreshing from the ususal professors at stanford, I really hope he gets tenure.
Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	205	2	5	4	3	693288	7/16/07	awesome prof. smart, quick, enthusiastic. great accent.

Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	137	3	5	4	3	693288	11/22/08	currently taking birds to words, and it's a great class. fernald and ramscar don't always get along, but they complement each other's teaching styles very well. he talks fast sometimes, but the content of the lectures is great and you can learn a lot from them. it's nice to have a psych class that isn't a re-hashing of psych-1 material...
Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	205	2	5	4	3	693288	4/12/08	Inspiring class. Pace was fast.
Stanford University	Michael Ramscar	4.2	2	Psychology	137	3	4	5	5	693288	1/30/07	Very interesting class. The Prof is a cool guy, or bloke, I should say.

Stanford University	Janine Reed	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	1	960394	6/23/11	In fact, I found Dr. Reed extremely helpful, caring, and bending over backwards to help people who seemed to have chips on their shoulders about having to take this writing course. She was extremely fair and agreeable and only a few people in the class objected - those people with chips worked hard to make it difficult for her. She changed my life
Stanford University	Janine Reed	3.5	0	Writing		2	2	2	1	960394	2/22/07	While on interesting topic, Dr. Reed undermines the course. The PWR course is supposed to be on developing writing, but her course really becomes a critique of globalization. Her bias against globalization is also evident. In fact, her bias is so great that the student is afraid to write in opposition to her stance.
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science	133	4	4	5	4	160530	12/9/07	actually cares about teaching. class really influenced me
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science	133	3	5	5	5	160530	7/4/06	a must take! great prof, helps you think critically, incredibly smart and remembered everyone's name on day 2!
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science		5	5	5	4	160530	1/19/05	Even though this turned out to be a class full of jocks, Reich kept it smart and engaging enough for even the nerdiest of public service peeps not to drop.
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science	133	3	5	5	5	160530	1/9/07	absolutely amazing.
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science		2	5	5	5	160530	10/2/05	This class made me think critically about volunteering and public service-- and made me better prepared to do it as a results. A must take for anyone involved in public service and/or ethics. Reich is engaging and challenging while stanying available and helpful.
Stanford University	Rob Reich	4.9	2	Political Science	133	3	5	5		160530	4/22/03	Great guy, and an awesome class.
Stanford University	Jeff Reynolds	5.0	2	English	187	1	5	5	5	1236288	12/28/08	Jeff was tremendous. So helpful. So thought provoking.
Stanford University	Condoleeza Rice	5.0	2	Political Science	249	2	5	5	5	769448	4/28/12	Amazing professor.
Stanford University	Condoleeza Rice	5.0	2	Political Science		3	5	5	5	769448	12/2/05	I Love this professor. I think she could run for president if she wanted to.
Stanford University	Jessica Riskin	5.0	2	History		3	5	5	4	1146669	10/9/12	Fantastic professor, encyclopedic knowledge, brilliant, helpful, and enthusiastic. Pretty sure her mind works twice as quickly as your average mortal, but that's why she's a Stanford professor.
Stanford University	Richard Roberts	4.0	2	History	245	3	4	4	5	971388	4/1/07	Hist 245G was organized well. First we read accounts of the colonial encounter in Africa. Then we read Dr. Roberts' "Households and Litigants," a legal history that made use of the previous accounts. Finally, we composed our own histories based on actual court cases. Roberts is very understanding and helpful, and generous with the grading.
Stanford University	Steve Rock	2.3	0	Engineering	205	3	2	2	5	308685	12/10/05	I was hoping to learn a lot from this class but trying to get clear explanations from this guy is next to impossible!
Stanford University	Steve Rock	2.3	1	Engineering	271	3	4	2		308685	12/3/03	Well-meaning, but not very clear. Ironically, has difficulty teaching the fundamentals on which he likes to focus. Tests are OK.
Stanford University	Steve Rock	2.3	0	Engineering	242	3	3	1	5	308685	5/5/05	I have to agree with the other guy. Its weird he makes simple topics like conservation of momentum or energy seem way harder and complex then they should be. Grading in fine and fair...but don't expect to be wowed by him
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		3	5	5	3	651090	9/17/12	Dr. Roman's PWR2 was great! She taught me how classical rhetoric could improve my speaking and writing skills and in the process gave me a new appreciation for film music. No complaints.
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		3	5	5	4	651090	4/8/07	Dr. Roman's class on rhetoric and film music is so far one of my favorite classes at Stanford. She is totally brilliant and passionate about the subject. She let us research what we wanted and gave us the appropriate guidance at the same time. She's a really fun person and also totally hot - I think I am in love with her . . . I highly recommend th
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	651090	11/3/06	Roman is awesome. Her class activities were usually fun and always useful. My speaking and writing improved greatly in her class!
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		2	5	5	1	651090	8/22/06	Roman went out of her way to help me improve.She graded my work based on where I am now in my learning process.She did not expect me to write like Shakespeare to get a good grade.She is an OUTSTANDING TEACHER.She represents the VERY BEST at Stanford!!!She is kind as a person and teacher.She wants her students to excel, learn, and have fun.
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		3	4	4	4	651090	9/29/05	Dr Roman is a very accomplished woman and her PWR 1 class really improved my writing. We had some class jokes and, contrary to common conceptions about PWR 1, the two-hour sessions were very enjoyable.
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		2	5	5	4	651090	9/18/08	Roman is one of the best professors I will ever have. Her course is hot, and she's hot. She taught from her research (including a 1-1 personal interview she conducted with Francis Coppola)and managed to combine that with Quintillian and classical Rhetoric. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Stanford.
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	651090	12/9/06	Dr. Roman's PWR 2 class on film music totally rocked. I learned so much about the subject and totally go over my fear of pubic speaking. Dr. Roman is energetic, brilliant and totally fun - her classes were always interesting snd her expectations realistc. I stronly recommend this class!
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	0	Writing		1	1	2	1	651090	10/5/06	She's very strict with her rules. Not a fun person, but she feel very good about herself. The atmosphere in class is OK, which is mostly due to the students us who strive to make discussions more fun. On the other hand she will usually swirl us back to the serious discussions (Rome, Greek and oratory).
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	0	Writing		4	1	1	3	651090	2/11/06	In our first meeting she told me how much her class would help me improve my writing and speaking. So far I have not learned one single thing in her class except that she's a mean, conceited person who doesn't know how to use quotation marks. I haven't learned anything about writing or speaking, or about film music (the subject of my pwr)
Stanford University	Laura Roman	3.8	0	Writing		5	2	1	1	651090	8/10/05	Well, my expectations for PWR were low, but at first I found her teaching near intolerable. Her style of speech is very affected, as are her staged gestures and stiff lesson plans. As I got to know her, I realized that she was nice, and I bet as she continues teaching, she'll loosed up a bit... but overall, the class wasn't terribly fun...
Stanford University	Nathan Rosenberg	4.5	2	Economics	224	3	4	5	4	55284	8/31/06	Liked the class. Liked that he graded all of our final papers himself - he did not have the TAs do it.
Stanford University	Nathan Rosenberg	4.5	2	Economics		3	5	4		55284	6/10/02	No Comments
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	0	English		5	1	2	2	105542	12/12/11	This class tried to incorporate both the CWP and CCR formats. This wasted a ton of time and Ms. Ross was herself very disorganized. She never evaluated anyone's work, nor provided any feedback, she simply provided a grade at the end of the quarter. Avoid taking a class from her at all costs. Avoid CWPs at all costs, for fear of getting a dud!
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	2	English		4	4	4	4	105542	12/21/05	great
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	2	English		2	5	5	3	105542	10/29/04	Carolyn Ross is the most amazing writing teacher. She definitely made me look at community service in a whole new way- the topic of her writing course became an object of analysis in its own right. I can actually say her class changed my life!
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	2	English	219	3	5	5		105542	8/28/03	good
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	0	English		1	1	1	4	105542	1/20/09	so frustratingly bad- horrible time management- blabs on and on
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	0	English		1	1	1	4	105542	3/9/05	Don't ever take a class from this woman. Straight up.
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	2	English		4	5	4		105542	11/16/03	Good teacher, helpful, approachable, friendly
Stanford University	Carolyn Ross	3.3	2	English	311	4	5	4		105542	12/28/02	great teacher! I loved her class
Stanford University	Christopher Rovee	5.0	2	English	369	4	5	5	5	864446	9/19/08	A very popular professor in the English department, and rightfully so. Always interested in what students have to say, available for consultation and encouragement, and has a good sense of humor about literary figures. He has a following of loyal students who take many of his classes.
Stanford University	Christopher Rovee	5.0	2	English	120	4	5	5	5	864446	7/9/06	By far the best teacher I've ever had at Stanford. Lectures were fun and interesting. Always available for office hours. Tests /papers graded very fairly.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	161	5	5	5	5	858899	6/1/08	Prof. Ruffinelli is a very good professor. He is knows his criteria extremely well. Also, he is really a very nice person and has a great sense of humor, which can be seen in his lectures. The class was not difficult at a all. He makes it so easy for you, and grades very fairly. Highly recomend him.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	255	3	5	4	4	858899	9/8/07	Professor Ruffinelli has an engaging, fun, & charismatic teaching style. His knowledge of Spanish and Latin American literature and film is truly one of a kind and it's obvious he is passionate about the subjects he teaches. He always makes time to meet with his students. I loved being in his class & hope to take more of his classes in the future.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	358	2	5	5	5	858899	9/5/06	Dr. Ruffinelli is an institution all by himself! From Latin American theory and literature to aesthetics and Film Studies, he is a bona fide expert. His course on the contemporary Latin American novel of the 90s was incredible. Dr. Ruffinelli has a lot to offer in his courses and he cares about his students. Highly, highly recommended.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	246	3	5	5	5	858899	6/18/06	No professor can possibly know more intimately the subject matter of this course! While his political tack is certainly left-leaning, Professor Ruffinelli knows most of the authors and filmmakers personally, so his insight is invaluable and interesting. He also takes careful note of his students and is muy simpatico.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	358	3	5	5	5	858899	5/21/08	Professor Jorge Ruffinelli is an outstanding teacher, scholar and thesis advisor. The breadth of his scholarship, his expansive knowledge of literature and film, and his life experience as a leading literary and cultural critic make his classes and guidance indispensable for students interested in Latin American culture, literature and cinema.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	254	5	5	4	5	858899	11/29/06	Jorge is extremely kind and always available. He is infectuously excited about the material he teaches, and he is always willing to make time for students. However, he sometimes gets off topic and does not always allow enough class discussion. Nonetheless, I very much enjoyed his class.
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	254	2	5	5	5	858899	9/4/06	We had to switch classrooms, because so many students came on the first day - we all wanted to take a class on censorship from someone who has lived it. Yet, despite his own views, Ruffinelli promoted discussion on both sides and, for many of us, altered our existing geo-political notions forever. Don't pass up an opportunity to take this class!
Stanford University	Jorge Ruffinelli	4.9	2	Languages	246	4	5	5	5	858899	6/16/06	This professor has thorough knowledge of the material and it shows. Picks great readings one can really get into. Gives class an interesting spin with personal anecdotes. Stimulates conversation and encourages student participation in class. Very approachable and helpful. Overall, one of the best Spanish Lit professors I've had at Stanford.
Stanford University	Helle Rytkonen	5.0	2	English		4	5	5	4	919232	6/20/07	Very helpful and fun. Great at teaching techniques etc.
Stanford University	Helle Rytkonen	5.0	2	English		4	5	5	5	919232	11/15/06	Supper helpful, always reachable via email. Doesn't mind explaining things for you, and she's funny/nice.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	3	203927	2/8/13	Awesome guy. Was extremely funny , helpful, and clear in describing the subject.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203927	7/25/12	I discovered this class on itunesU and got hooked. He has a very engaging style and is interesting to listen to. I wish my university had people like this!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	203927	4/26/12	Mehran is a bright and interesting lecturer who keeps his audience in mind. My only criticism is his use of pet phrases (e.g. Rock On) which amuse at first but become tiresome by the 10th lecture.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	5	203927	2/17/12	Perfect.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203927	1/23/12	Mr Mehran is simply a brilliant teacher.

Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	4	5	203927	12/21/10	Oh how I love Dr. Sahami! He's funny, smart, and LOVES to teach! I'm on video 7 of his CS 106A class (I don't attend Stanford); he's THE BEST EVER! Now I can say I UNDERSTAND Comp Sci! I took 2 CS classes at my own alma mater and HATED it each time. Now I LOVE IT! THANK YOU Mehran! YOU TOTALLY ROCK! (I added a hot chili pepper for bonus lol :))
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	4	203927	7/16/10	I just watched the lectures online and found them so interesting! I am not even taking this course yet, but was just intrigued by the lectures!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	5	203927	12/6/12	The most inspiring professor I've ever had. Helpful, funny (i mean extremely funny), and clear. He does his best to entertain students. I have never took any CS class before and now I am in love with computer programming because of him. Class is of course not that easy, and there are always at least 500 students, but it is all worthwhile.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203927	5/24/12	saw his lectures online, this guy is amazing!! wish my college had teachers like him. his lectures made my first year so much easier. amazing guy!!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	203927	3/10/12	I stumbled upon the CS106A lectures on iTunes U and found that professor Mehran Sahami really teaches brilliantly! His clear, structured, uncluttered explanations, and the very apt examples are a huge help in understanding and retaining the concepts in ones mind. I loved the lectures and learnt a lot. Such teachers make a difference. Thank you!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	5	203927	1/31/12	He makes learning a joyful , fun experience!! I wish even my college had teachers like him.

Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203927	8/17/10	I am a computer science student, but do not attend Stanford University. I have seen most of his online lectures on programming methodology and i have been blown away. By far the best professor/instructor/teacher/lecturer i have EVER seen in front of a class doing what they do best.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	4	203927	6/7/10	I didn't go to Stanford either, but am listening to his lectures on Java on my commute to and from work. A fantastic teacher with a very engaging style.

Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	1	203927	12/21/07	Awesome teacher. Make sure you fill your CS requirement with Mehran.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5	4	203927	10/1/07	This guy is unbelievably good!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	4	203927	4/18/06	What a nut. He's awesome.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	4	203927	5/18/10	I don't even go to Stanford. I watched Mehran's Programming Methodology lectures online. He's awesome.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	203927	4/7/10	He re-engineered our interests in CS again. I am addicted to his lectures.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	5	203927	9/30/09	his is a genious

Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	4	203927	2/18/09	the best i've ever seen
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	4	5	2	203927	5/3/08	Best Teacher I've Had At Stanford
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5	5	203927	10/23/07	take his class, enough said.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	4	203927	8/31/06	I went into CS106A thinking I just needed to fulfill a requirement. I left and got a CS minor. Very engaging. Very user friendly introduction to CS. True quote from a classmate: "I'm so fuzzy I shed. I love this class. I can't believe I love this class."
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	5	203927	12/19/05	Baller.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	5	203927	10/29/05	This guy was freakin amazing. If you've got to take CS106A and you're not too keen on it, you should definitely take it from Mehran. Seriously. He even passes out candy in class, so you can't go wrong by going to lecture.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	3	203927	1/7/05	Awesome CS teacher who makes everything clear, and wears costumes and funny vocabulary to boot. He works for Google and if you go to one of his Google talks he just may give you a free Google flashlight keychain.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	4	203927	11/14/04	Mehran rocks my socks off.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5		203927	9/8/03	Tough class, but an amazing lecturer. Definitely gets concepts across.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	103	2	5	5		203927	5/3/03	Mehran is an excellent teacher, and his problem sets are designed to retain knowledge.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	103	5	3	4	5	203927	5/1/05	All my friends raved about how great he was, but I just didn't think he was that funny. Attending lecture was certainly not necessary.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	4	5	5	5	203927	12/22/04	Hired as a lecturer, he does the job well. Cheerful, friendly, and fun.
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	2	5	5		203927	4/12/04	Mehran is the rockin-est CS prof since Stuart Regis!
Stanford University	Mehran Sahami	4.9	2	Computer Science	106	1	5	5		203927	8/4/03	Awesome lecturer who knows his stuff. Funny guy too!
Stanford University	Victoria Rodrigue	5.0	2	Music		5	5	5	5	1662703	9/26/12	Awesome TA. I never cared about musical cultures of the world until she awakened something in me. She can play my bansuri flute anytime.
Stanford University	David Rogosa	2.7	0	Education	252	1	2	2	5	70197	2/14/07	Rogosa is about as clear as mud. He has a serious attitude and is extremely UNhelpful to students.
Stanford University	David Rogosa	2.7	2	Education		3	5	5		70197	10/14/02	Rogosa is the coolest, most barefooted guy in Stats/Education.
Stanford University	David Rogosa	2.7	0	Education	141	1	1	1	3	70197	11/30/06	Rogosa fails to engage the attention of his students because he fidgets the whole time he is lecturing. His lecture material is not helpful when applied towards the take home assignments.
Stanford University	Richard Rorty	4.5	2	Philosophy	110	2	5	5	4	67574	4/20/06	curmudgeonly-hot. it's unnerving how charismatic he is.
Stanford University	Richard Rorty	4.5	1	Philosophy		1	4	2	3	67574	1/20/05	He told me that the coloring puzzles at Denny's held the key to eternal happiness. All you have to do is hold them upside down. Mind boggling!!
Stanford University	Richard Rorty	4.5	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	5	67574	3/28/05	No Comments
Stanford University	Richard Rorty	4.5	2	Philosophy		3	5	5		67574	10/7/02	Richard Rorty holds the key to understanding western thought. I'm not kidding.
Stanford University	Mendel Rosenblum	3.9	2	Computer Science	240	3	4	4	5	583269	11/13/09	He clearly knows his stuff. A little bit mumbling in speech.
Stanford University	Mendel Rosenblum	3.9	2	Computer Science	140	2	4	4	5	583269	4/4/06	Good at answering questions via email and after class, but not in office hour. Lecture is not interesting but clear enough. He speaks fast. His tone is too flat to make you sleepy. Final exam questions are interesting.

Stanford University	Mendel Rosenblum	3.9	2	Computer Science	140	4	5	4	4	583269	8/3/07	he liked to wear crocs before they were cool
Stanford University	Mendel Rosenblum	3.9	1	Computer Science	140	3	3	2	2	583269	3/22/06	Could be more enthusiastic, not the best teacher, but not the worst.
Stanford University	Tim Roughgarden	4.8	2	Computer Science	101	4	5	4	5	1037619	6/28/12	wonderful teacher
Stanford University	Tim Roughgarden	4.8	2	Computer Science	161	2	5	5	5	1037619	4/20/12	Awesome!
Stanford University	Tim Roughgarden	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	5	1037619	6/20/12	He taught me on coursera. He teaches nice
Stanford University	Tim Roughgarden	4.8	2	Computer Science	364	1	5	5	5	1037619	10/14/09	awesome
Stanford University	Yu-Hwa Rozelle	4.9	2	Languages		5	4	5	4	13888	2/16/09	Very funny and very caring prof. Her sense of humor makes classes go by very quickly. Taught very relevant vocab and phrases for elementary Mandarin conversation.
Stanford University	Yu-Hwa Rozelle	4.9	2	Languages	678	3	5	5	5	13888	5/8/07	great and enthusiastic.

Stanford University	Yu-Hwa Rozelle	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	13888	8/21/08	extremely nice prof, easygoing class.
Stanford University	Yu-Hwa Rozelle	4.9	2	Languages		2	5	5	5	13888	8/20/06	Really friendly and always willing to help & understand students!
Stanford University	Yu-Hwa Rozelle	4.9	2	Languages		3	5	5		13888	9/4/01	A very empathetic chinese prof who cares about her students!
Stanford University	Merritt Ruhlen	3.5	2	Languages	111	4	4	3	3	899870	10/12/06	Merritt has a slight stutter, and his book is written to be readable by the layman, so the class comes across as rather low-brow at first. However, things do get more interesting, Merritt has decent answers for most counter-arguments to his claims, and the internal flame wars in the field of historical linguistics we read in class can be amusing.
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	2	Political Science	120	3	5	4	4	671900	5/3/11	He is very good and I enjoy going to class. I would highly recommend taking a class from him.
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	2	Political Science	124	3	4	4	5	671900	10/17/07	These other people just can't appreciate Rutten's teaching methods. He tries to connect overall themes in Political Science to everyday occurrences, shedding new light on why exactly the machine functions the way it does. Definitely a professor you need to take more than one class to get appreciation for.
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	0	Political Science	124	2	1	2	3	671900	1/4/07	Horrible. He has one of the biggest egos and doesn't have a clue about what he's trying to teach. He spends most of his time picking on students...
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	2	Political Science		3	4	4	2	671900	1/12/06	I can't remember what the exact name of the class is, but Rutten rocks, hes extremely eclectic and kind of out there but he's def. entertaining
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	2	Political Science	120	3	5	5	4	671900	12/11/07	As other posters have noted, Rutten's teaching methods are unique, but very effective. What really sets him apart, though, is that he actually cares that his students are learning. He is always available to meet outside of class, and takes a true interest in students. I've learned more in Rutten's classes than my other PoliSci classes combined.
Stanford University	Andy Rutten	3.2	0	Political Science	124	2	1	1	2	671900	3/14/07	While I think he has good intentions, Rutten probably shouldn't be a professor. The entire quarter consisted of discussions about nothing substantive. While they were interesting, they ultimately led nowhere. I don't know what I learned this quarter. Not recommended.

Stanford University	Scott Sagan	3.2	0	Political Science		1	2	2	3	264149	6/17/06	Prof. Sagan is knowlegeable but suffers from scholastic hubris. Like many others I am sure that he would like to be the next Kissinger or Condi.
Stanford University	Scott Sagan	3.2	0	Political Science		1	1	1	1	264149	9/28/05	Professor Sagan is quite knowledgeable and seriously committed to international security.However,he is like other policy wonk types who belong to the CFR--namely, full of hubris and set in his ideological ways.
Stanford University	Scott Sagan	3.2	1	Political Science		3	3	3		264149	10/19/03	A serious professor with a low level of tolerance for student error. Kind of arrogant despite his knowledge of the material and certainly not too keen about Bush or the Republicans.
Stanford University	Scott Sagan	3.2	2	Political Science	114	3	5	5	5	264149	2/22/06	Brilliant lecturer, very clear, well-structured presentations, good insight. He expects analytic rigor from his students. It is unsurprising that some people bear a grudge when they don't get to coast through the class. The ratings don't really reflect how good an instructor he is. Better to trust the high enrollment for non-required classes.

Stanford University	Brajesh  Samarth	5.0	2	Languages	154	4	5	5	5	1789039	1/13/13	He's great - learning the language, the culture, the history and lots of other interesting stuff along the way. Really incorporates what is pertinent to current events and our lives to make the class very interesting. Definitely my favorite class ever.
Stanford University	Brajesh  Samarth	5.0	2	Languages	154	3	5	5	5	1789039	1/3/13	Truly amazing teacher. Incorporates the culture, history, and literature of India with language learning. Listens to each student, facilitates just what is needed for comprehension (but lets you get there yourself), is unfailingly supportive, and has a great laugh too.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology		5	5	5	5	362964	11/8/12	Best. Lecturer. Ever.

Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	3	5	5	5	362964	1/3/07	Best teacher I've had --- hands down. And probably the best class I've taken at Stanford. There are simply no words to describe the experience. He is funny, animated, approchable, makes materal accessable for understanding, and just blows your mind by the connections he makes between different fields. You are literally on the edge of the seat..
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	4	5	5	3	362964	6/18/06	Best class. Period.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	4	5	5	5	362964	4/5/06	you must take the class before leaving Stanford. One of the best at Stanford.

Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	4	4	5	4	362964	9/22/04	Human Behavioral Biology is the best course I have taken at Stanford and Sapolsky is by far the best lecturer I've ever had here.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	4	4	5		362964	5/7/04	Sapolsky is simply the man.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology		5	5	5	1	362964	9/7/12	he's the best teacher I've NEVER had, I saw all his lectures on youtube and he is freaking awesome, too bad I can't afford stanford otherwise I would take his class regardless of my major.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	3	5	5	5	362964	11/25/08	Best teacher in the Biology department by far

Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	3	5	5	5	362964	6/13/06	There should be a portal into Spolsky's head. Freakin. Great.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	3	5	5	5	362964	3/11/06	One of the best classes I've taken at Stanford (no wonder it always has 500+ students). Sapolsky's amazing.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology		2	5	5	4	362964	12/15/04	Took this some years ago when I was on campus. Sapolsky managed to mix amygdalas, hormones, and stories from africa to make a class with 100s of students feel like it was a class of ten.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology	150	3	4	5		362964	5/11/04	One of the best lecturers at Stanford.
Stanford University	Robert Sapolsky	4.9	2	Biology		3	4	5		362964	3/8/04	Actually, I don't know if he's easy as we haven't taken the exam yet, but this professor is awesome! His lectures are entertaining as well as informative. Very knowledgeable and makes material come to life. I actually look forward to Bio Core lectures!
Stanford University	Priya Satia	2.6	2	History	333	2	4	4	4	291530	3/21/10	I took a graduate-level class with her and three other students. She's good at shepherding discussion along. I don't know that she always added too much to the discussion, but that was cool because it made us talk to each other instead of to her. She could have been a little clearer about assignments though.
Stanford University	Priya Satia	2.6	2	History	139	2	5	4	3	291530	3/6/08	excellent course overall. the lectures were very clear and did a good job of unifying the (substantial) course readings. learnt a lot in the course, changed my view of the relationship between britain and its colonies. definitely recommended for anyone with an interest in britain or colonial history.

Stanford University	Tony Seba	2.0	0	Business		5	2	2	5	1723545	5/14/12	Very slow lecturer. Condescending and unhelpful when questions are asked. Course materials are way to vague to be helpful. I joined because I'm in high tech marketing, which was the focus of the course. Unfortunately, it was more full of cliches than practical advice.

Stanford University	Kenneth Schultz	4.7	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	962978	3/4/07	He is an amazing professor! His lectures are interesting and easy to understand. He's funny and very approachable. PS1 was one of the best classes I've ever taken and he's one of the best professors I've had at Stanford.
Stanford University	Kenneth Schultz	4.7	2	Political Science		4	4	4	4	962978	2/16/08	He genuinely cares about his students and he makes learning fun. Unlike a lot of professors, he is not pompous. He is a nice guy, and quite handsome. I could look at him all day. :)

Stanford University	David Siegmund	3.0	2	Mathematics	310	2	5	3	3	899869	6/9/09	I took him years ago. He was very kind and helpful and always tried to answer everyone's questions. His lectures tended to emphasize details; you had to construct the big picture on your own. Could have been more clear, but a good prof and a good guy.
Stanford University	David Siegmund	3.0	2	Mathematics	116	2	4	4	3	899869	10/12/06	Prof. Siegmund is very patient, teaches at a decent pace, and is very willing to be interrupted and asked questions. Stats116 is still hard, but Prof. Siegmund may be a good professor to take it with.
Stanford University	David Siegmund	3.0	0	Mathematics	310	5	1	1	1	899869	2/8/08	He tells students that homework scores are not taken into account for the final grade, but...... His surly attitude takes away joy from the learning process.

Stanford University	Tanya Shasko	4.9	2	Languages		3	5	5	4	824986	11/6/07	Probably the coolest, most supportive teacher I have ever had. Was as awesome to run into Moonbean's with for a random chat as she in the classroom. She was happy to give extra help to the panicked student and also listen to boyfriend woes. And the best part? Two years later, I haven't given up with French. Because she didn't let me.

Stanford University	Tanya Shasko	4.9	2	Languages		5	5	5	1	824986	7/7/06	Great teacher and she's pretty, what more can you ask for?
Stanford University	James Sheehan	4.3	2	History		2	5	5	4	138156	1/8/10	He's incredible. He has this gift for making these pithy comments that get at the heart of things and really help you out. If you can take a seminar with him, DO IT.
Stanford University	James Sheehan	4.3	0	History		3	2	1		138156	12/11/03	Imperious. Kaiser James. Occasionally deigns to speak to mortals, including gifted former high school students who somehow were permitted to pollute his beloved Stanford.
Stanford University	James Sheehan	4.3	2	History		4	4	5		138156	4/22/03	This guy goes though an entire lecture as though it's a rehearsed speech - amazing.

Stanford University	James Sheehan	4.3	2	History		3	5	5		138156	8/4/03	One of the most amazing lecturers I've ever heard. He's engaging and doesn't need to constantly refer to notes. Very few people ever fall asleep when he's talking.

Stanford University	Edward Solomon	2.5	0	Chemistry	253	3	1	1	4	1017906	4/2/08	Goes way way way fast, but funny to watch sweat up there. Good for a laugh, not good for learning
Stanford University	Edward Solomon	2.5	2	Chemistry	153	4	4	4	4	1017906	8/16/07	He teaches ok. He sweats a lot though. I wish the tests were a little harder. And I wish the book wasn't so overpriced.
Stanford University	Melody Spradlin	4.0	2	Engineering	224	3	5	3	5	967715	3/21/07	Mrs. Spradlin is such a great teacher. Her industry experience is outstanding and inspiring. She is a very helpful and her lessons are interesting. She teaches this master's class with one of her collegeues. It's great to see two successful women teaching an engineering course.

Stanford University	Alison Stine	4.1	2	Writing	150	3	4	3		244460	11/24/03	Gives bad essay topics. It is hard to find a writing style that she likes. Fair teacher, needs some more experience, but good job for your first sememster.

The textbook was good and had good examples which helped a lot. The midterm was fine but the final was perhaps too difficult. If you have an open book open notes test be prepared for a very long 3 hours.
Stanford University	Lenny Susskind	3.6	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	738631	12/1/05	He's an entertaining maverick; impressive, some would say.
Stanford University	Lenny Susskind	3.6	1	Physics		1	3	2	5	738631	11/28/05	this guy might as well be speaking chinese during lecture. the very few people who understand him, I suspect, have been exposed to the materials before.
Stanford University	Lenny Susskind	3.6	2	Physics		4	4	5	5	738631	10/4/09	If you don't like Susskind, you don't like objectivity being spread clearly. Everybody entitled to their opinions, nobody entitled to their facts.
Stanford University	Lenny Susskind	3.6	0	Physics		1	1	2	5	738631	7/25/06	Although the subject material itslef was difficult, the difficulty of the class wasn't helped by the fact that there was no syllabus, and office hours were frequently cancelled. Yes, he is very smart, and for those students who wish to go beyond the material he is very helpful. But to the rest of the class he is dissmissive and condecending.
Stanford University	Lenny Susskind	3.6	2	Physics		1	5	5	5	738631	11/30/05	Everyone agrees that the class is very hard. But I think it's the class, not the prof. I like Susskind a lot; I find his lectures very interesting and helpful. He approaches the material from unique and interesting perspectives (at least in 60 series) that are good for learning the reasons behind the way physics works.

Stanford University	Mary Sprague	2.7	2	Political Science	120	4	5	5	5	887806	8/26/07	Great teacher/lecturer. Have taken two classes from her and enjoyed them both very much.
Stanford University	Mary Sprague	2.7	0	Political Science	123	1	1	1	1	887806	9/6/06	Horrible lecturer. Relies too much on PowerPoint. Students essentially have to teach themselves because the professor certainly isn't doing it. Worst professor I've had at Stanford. I'm surprised that Stanford would employ someone of such low caliber.
Stanford University	Mary Sprague	2.7	0	Political Science	120	5	2	2	5	887806	4/8/07	Does rely on powerpoint too much
Stanford University	Balaji Srinivasan	4.8	2	Biology	110	1	5	5	3	1067874	12/18/09	Best. professor. EVER. I took Stats from him in 07. Amazingly made statistics not boring, could be a standup comedian for all the jokes he put in. Works out all the time, pretty cut for a Stanford prof. Very HARD course though.
Stanford University	Balaji Srinivasan	4.8	2	Biology		4	4	5	3	1067874	12/5/07	Awesome
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	4	580291	5/4/10	Excellent teacher!
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	2	Chemistry	151	2	5	5	1	580291	12/6/06	I had no desire to take 151, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes at stanford. Stack is a really great professor; he explains things very well. Problem sets and exams are hard; but he's fairly lenient on the final grades. If you've only had organic chem, then you should definitely take this class.
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	0	Chemistry	151	2	1	2	5	580291	3/29/06	Dr. Stack knows there's something seriously wrong with the chemistry department, and as director of undergraduate studies, he does all he can to discourage students from majoring in chem. I wish I'd been turned off by his outright rudeness - I wish I hadn't majored in chemistry, since the teaching quality in the chem department is terrible.
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	1	Chemistry		3	2	3	3	580291	3/18/05	Very uptight about rules; Sort of annoying in class although very energetic. Tries to make the class engaging and interesting, but fails in my opinion.
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	2	Chemistry		2	4	3	3	580291	7/13/07	I think..he puts forward his ideas quite clearly.And he tries to make the lectures more interesting . However,dunno whether it's his selection of timing of class , early in the morning like 9:00 ,listening to 2 hours of lecture is definitely not very enjoyable...That's the reason why I drop to 31X which is a relatively a more flexible class .
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	4	580291	3/29/06	Chem 33 is hard, that's for sure. One thing though, Stack is cool. Lectures are fun and engaging and very easy to follow. I dont really like his teaching with slideshow but other than that, extremely helpful and friendly. One thing to note is that his exams are tricky, pay attention in class!
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	1	Chemistry		3	3	2	4	580291	4/25/05	The lectures are not bad - although I have certainly encountered better. The worse aspect of this class is that the book, lecture, problem sets and tests do not have anything to do with one another. The profs hate the book - and tell you that it's crap: talk about encouragement.
Stanford University	Dan Stack	3.4	1	Chemistry		3	1	4	5	580291	3/14/05	An alright lecturer. Too bad the tests aren't about the lectures & that he's patronizing to students.
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		1	5	5	3	1474184	3/4/13	She's really good at helping you articulate your own ideas, but make sure you do all the writing assignments, esp the daily ones, these add up a lot and really affect your grade
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		1	5	5	5	1474184	12/18/12	Rumored to be super chill, she even tells you it's easy to get an A if you revise and pay attention, but if you slack even the slightest, she's will let you know EXACTLY why your work was subpar and then some. BEWARE!
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	1474184	11/22/12	Awesome professor! Classes with her are always fun and inspiring!
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	1474184	6/18/12	The best professor I have had, ever.
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	1474184	9/2/10	Dr. Starkman is a wonderful teacher, who makes the great books of political philosophy accessible and fun to talk about. The reading is hard, but it's stuff you always wished you knew. She's got a wicked sense of humor and a great sense of style too!
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	3	1474184	1/15/13	brilliant, hilarious, and yes, totally in your face, she wants you to learn and do something in the world!
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	5	1474184	12/5/12	She's super smart, cultured, laid back. But intense too, makes you to revise, revise, revise until you do A work.
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	3	1474184	11/22/12	Starkman the merciful, helpful, and awesome, unless bring doom on yourself
Stanford University	Ruth Starkman	5.0	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	2	1474184	10/13/11	I was dreading pwr, I used to hate writing, but now this is my favorite most useful, course! Starkman is super helpful, nice, smart, funny and very cool. The best introduction to Stanford I could have!

Stanford University	James Frank Strnad	3.3	2	Law		3	4	3	4	133725	9/9/05	Smart. Friendly. Can get unfocused. I enjoyed studying tax - so thats a thumbs up.
Stanford University	Hannah Sullivan	4.5	2	English		2	4	5	5	1310416	6/1/10	She's absolutely amazing. I would take a million classes with her if I could get away with it.
Stanford University	Lisa Surwillo	3.3	2	Languages	218	2	5	5	4	997956	3/4/10	I've taken two classes with Lisa. She is GENUINELY interested in what her students have to say and doesn't want to just lecture. Participate when you have something insightful to say. DO THE READING, as nothing will help you more. Great teacher. Brilliant, caring, and amazing! I'd definitely recommend her classes for a truly rewarding experience.
Stanford University	Lisa Surwillo	3.3	1	Languages	320	5	1	5	1	997956	5/31/07	She's lazy. Lisa is never prepared for class, and the student has to do all the work, while she's just supervising and hanging around.
Stanford University	Lisa Surwillo	3.3	0	Languages	320	5	1	3	1	997956	6/4/07	Her teaching approach is not very useful and practical to the students. She is never prepared for class, and relies all the work on the students.
Stanford University	Pantipa Tachawachira	1.0	0	Management	500	1	1	1	1	884705	8/30/06	Dont take any class that this lady teaches. She is the devil. She will tell you that a 20/100 is good. It does not really matter how you do on the test, because she like to think she should decide your grade. She loves the SWOT analysis. P.S. I probably hate her more than anyone on the face of the earth.

Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	0	Economics		5	2	2	3	216856	6/12/09	Prof. Tendall teaches you the mathematical steps to solve very specific types of problems. Of course, no one actually learns what anything means, but at least you can get a good grade without understanding "hard" concepts!
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	1	Economics	102	4	4	2	4	216856	5/18/09	Mark is a nice guy and is clearer than many professors, but his teaching style is terrible. Rather than helping students understand concepts, he focuses on simple computational rote learning. If you want a very straightforward class where you *don't really learn anything*, you will like this class.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		3	5	4	4	216856	1/14/08	Wonderful Professor. A brilliant academic whose enthusiasm for economics is contagious. He is interesting, funny, and nice. He genuinely cares about his students and their success. I am happy to have taken a class from him.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		3	4	4	3	216856	9/18/07	Solid professor, and a good guy too
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	0	Economics	102	1	1	1	1	216856	12/14/06	very confusing. i understood this stats in 9th grade but can't remember any of it now.. his lectures are sleep-inducing and perplexing.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		4	5	5	4	216856	9/6/06	Such a nice professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to learn. Psets and exams are generally straightforward. No surprises there.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		2	5	4	4	216856	3/28/06	very funny, lectures were good, exams fair, but problem sets were intense
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		3	5	5	4	216856	1/9/06	Great professor. One of the best I've had so far.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	0	Economics		5	2	1	1	216856	8/30/05	Has weird speech delivery. Should be more direct.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		2	5	5	4	216856	5/27/05	Funny, articulate, and clear.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	1	Economics	102	2	3	2	2	216856	2/8/05	Lectures are a bit convoluted and his patronizing delivery is even less appealing. Sure, he wants you to learn, but when you are struggling, he is not the most helpful or encouraging.
Stanford University	Mark Tendall	3.7	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	216856	10/4/04	Mark Tendall is always friedly and explains the content in a very simple & straight-forward way. One of the best professors I ever had! Felix Engler-Hamm

Stanford University	Kenric Theslikai	4.8	2	Languages	124	1	5	5	5	497787	8/28/07	Kenric is a FABULOUS teacher of French, who is undoubtedly in love with the language and aspires wholeheartedly to pass this love on to his students. He's one of the TOUGHEST graders around, but trust me--a class with him is absolutely worth it!
Stanford University	Kenric Theslikai	4.8	2	Languages	124	3	5	4	4	497787	3/28/06	he truly cares about the students and always puts their needs first. he is very flexible with your schedule and understanding to your needs, as long as you accomplish all the work. very friendly and nice, great teacher.
Stanford University	Kenric Theslikai	4.8	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	497787	8/31/06	Kenric is really nice, helpful and a good teacher... the only problem is that his classes are pretty boring.
Stanford University	Kenric Theslikai	4.8	2	Languages		3	5	4	5	497787	11/13/04	Teaches his french class with lots of flexibility and encourages students to ask about and discuss anything dealing with French that they are curious about.

Stanford University	Rob Tibshirani	1.5	0	Mathematics	315	4	2	2	1	1079463	12/4/08	He doesn't seem very interested in teaching the class. Good research is what gets you recognition at Stanford. He recognizes this and that's why he doesn't spend as much time with the course as he should. Only the students would benefit from doing this, not him unfortunately........
Stanford University	Rob Tibshirani	1.5	0	Mathematics	306	5	1	1	5	1079463	12/26/07	can't teach
Stanford University	Rob Tibshirani	1.5	0	Mathematics	306	5	2	2	5	1079463	1/27/08	didn't really like the class
Stanford University	Rob Tibshirani	1.5	0	Mathematics	306	3	1	1	3	1079463	12/19/07	Tibs is the worst teacher I have ever had. I think his preparation is lacking as evidenced by the fact students notice mistakes in his slides midway through the lecture. Friends with some of the students outside of class. Not right because the questions on midterm are quite subjective. Profs shouldn't be friends with students who aren't advisees!!!
Stanford University	Victoria Szabo	4.8	2	Humanities		5	4	5	2	544816	12/20/05	Though my IHUM sucked testicles, Victoria was an awesome TF. Best one I've ever had or heard about.

If you apply yourself *a little*, you will lean a *whole lot* from him. What I like most about his classes, both the undergrad and the grad, is that you learn how to practically apply the skills that you learn.

Stanford University	Ewart Thomas	4.7	2	Psychology		3	5	5	2	242820	5/25/05	If you need to take Stats, be sure and take it with Prof.Thomas.

Don't be afraid to get help from him if you're finding things confusing. He is a great teacher.

Stanford University	Fouad Tobagi	1.5	0	Engineering	284	5	1	2	2	796614	6/30/09	Very poor, uninspiring.
Stanford University	Fouad Tobagi	1.5	1	Engineering	284	1	3	3	3	796614	12/6/07	He's much more of a "discovery" method teacher. He will give you partial information and then homework assignments which force you to "discover" the answer. In other classes, teachers probably tell you this is why this method is better than that and then do the math proof for you. In this class you figure it out yourself.
Stanford University	Fouad Tobagi	1.5	0	Engineering	284	2	1	1	1	796614	7/3/09	Boring classes. Good at telling stories but not at teaching. A waste of time.
Stanford University	Fouad Tobagi	1.5	0	Engineering	284	3	1	1	3	796614	10/19/08	He was a person who didn´t care at all about his Teaching Assistants...
Stanford University	Claire Tomlin	4.3	2	Engineering	205	4	5	4	3	266426	9/1/05	Excellent notes. Lecture sometimes gets boring. Fortunately the classes are online as well. The labs are a joy to do.
Stanford University	Claire Tomlin	4.3	2	Engineering	205	3	4	4		266426	10/23/03	Excellent instructor - wonderful notes. Highly recommend E205. E209A isn't quite as good.
Stanford University	Claire Tomlin	4.3	2	Engineering	205	3	4	5	4	266426	5/5/05	Probably one of the best instructors at stanford. Not interesting or entertaining. Lecture is actually somewhat boring. BUT she is great at conveying topics and presenting what material is important.
Stanford University	Barbara Tversky	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	4	627769	6/1/05	Professor Tversky is a great teacher. She loves cognitive psych and makes it very interesting.
Stanford University	Leo Tzou	4.0	1	Mathematics		1	2	4	3	1177858	3/17/09	Drawing from previous comments. He can be quite an interesting character but rather obnoxious at the same time. He taught the class, rather well, but perhaps disregarded the pace of the class. It depends on your preferences.
Stanford University	Leo Tzou	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	1177858	2/1/09	Leo Tzou is one of those love or hate professors. If you don't mind having a little fun in class, you'll probably like him. If you like the more interesting parts of multivariable integration--that is, you'd rather think about the geometry of space rather than arbitrarily hard integrations--then you'll probably like him too. A very memorable class.
Stanford University	Ravi Vakil	5.0	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	759564	11/22/12	very inspiring professor! You can feel in every class that he loves his field and enjoys sharing his passion for mathematics with his students.

Stanford University	N Vanderkindren	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	1068225	6/15/10	She's really friendly and interested in helping students understand. It's challenging but the class is totally fun, easy if you actually go to class and do the work. I would totally take this class again!
Stanford University	Keith Waldron	3.0	1	Engineering		2	4	2	3	861371	6/26/06	The material in E15 is quite difficult. That being said, this professor makes it much harder by not really teaching during lecture. He relies too much on PowerPoint to show concepts and examples. When he does use the board he actually does teach decently. Homework is hard but tests are okay. Engine project is difficult but really cool.
Stanford University	Sarah Walters	3.9	2	Engineering	274	3	5	4	2	1459206	7/19/11	She is good. Clear communicator and very caring. Makes you learn.
Stanford University	Sarah Walters	3.9	2	Engineering	274	3	5	4	1	1459206	2/2/11	Dr. Walters did a fine job of making an otherwise uninteresting topic (to an engineer) interesting. She genuinely cared about her student's success. Her lectures were well organized and she seemed very well informed of the lecture topics. She has a great sense of humor and is a fair professor.
Stanford University	Sarah Walters	3.9	2	Engineering	274	3	5	4	3	1459206	2/2/11	Professor Walters is a compassionate professor. I have not seen many professors who care about their students success as she does. She took the time to clearly explain concepts during lecture and was thorough in relaying important information. She encouraged critical thinking and gave an oral final exam which was very useful.
Stanford University	Sarah Walters	3.9	0	Engineering	274	4	1	3	4	1459206	7/8/10	Overall a very poor professor. Lectures were disorganized, and it was clear that Prof Walters was not prepared for them. There were many cases where she'd stop for an awkwardly long amount of time to read a slide to herself when it appeared on-screen, as if she'd never seen it before. She often spoke with a condescending tone.
Stanford University	Mike Tomz	4.5	2	Political Science		3	5	5	5	67582	10/15/10	Awesome teacher. When I first took this class, I thought I would be turned off from IR. How wrong I was. Besides that he's an influential guy in the field, he's extremely clear and helpful. The tests are hard and you have to do a lot of work, but it's worth it.
Stanford University	Mike Tomz	4.5	1	Political Science	101	3	3	3	3	67582	12/22/08	test
Stanford University	Mike Tomz	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	67582	12/13/06	Excellent class; its painful during the process but it provides a foundation for any PoliSci class you'll take after it.

Stanford University	Mike Tomz	4.5	1	Political Science		3	3	3	2	67582	2/22/06	Arrogant weasel, writes 'gotcha' exams (relevance of Annie Oakley to international relations? if she'd accidentally shot some German politician, WWI might not have happened.... Is this really something that should be on a test?), uses and abuses his research assistant gophers.

Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	249	5	1	2	2	658957	11/1/11	Very easy classes overall. Smart students should look for someone else with real content and solid educational theories that could enlighten us in the real world of public education. Easy grader 'cz she does not want to make waves. But it would be better to make waves and teach something challenging ro begin with.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	249	5	2	1	2	658957	9/18/11	I'm not impressed with this prof, because her theories of education are based on anecdotes or personal stories. There is not anything scientific that as educators we can use when we go to the real world of educational leadership. A real disappointment.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	241	5	1	1	2	658957	8/22/11	She isn't that bad, but she could be better if she could impress smarter students. Her thing is about English and learning or not learning it. A real disappointment.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	2	Education	101	5	5	3	2	658957	11/25/08	Very knowledgeable about her field of study, she knows everything about the Spanish language. Also, she is extremely articulate in both English and Spanish. However, sometimes her lecture are too verbose.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	2	Education	249	4	4	5	5	658957	3/21/06	Great class, great professor - very knowledgable, friendly. Easy grader
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	264	5	1	2	1	658957	1/14/12	One knows more about a class after several years. In the end some courses are useless in real life and work. I have to begin to de-learn what I thought was inspirational but it isn't
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	249	5	1	1	2	658957	10/24/11	I was not impressed with the content of this class. Theories of education are neither solid nor persuasive. Readings are way too easy for grad students who have more potential than what prof. Valdes has perceived. If you don't have to take this instructor, please don't.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	0	Education	242	5	1	1	2	658957	8/22/11	She talks and talks and talks, and it is hard to get the gist of what she said in one whole hour. If you don't have to take this class, please don't. It's a major waste of time.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	2	Education	249	4	5	5	4	658957	2/22/09	One of the best profs I had at Stanford!
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	2	Education	264	3	5	5	5	658957	11/26/06	Wonderful professor. Very experienced and thought provoking. Dr. Valdez keeps it real.
Stanford University	Guadalupe Valdes	2.7	2	Education	115	3	4	5	5	658957	11/30/05	Very interesting class, especially for those who are interested in exploring the future of Spanish in the US and in the language angle of Latin culture. Only thing that keeps me from rating it higher is lack of free student discussion. Some, not enough.
Stanford University	Andras Vasy	4.0	2	Mathematics	113	4	4	4	4	899864	10/12/06	Andras is teaching m113 with a new book, so it's much easier now (2006-07) than last year (2005-06). He pretty much covers the book proof by proof in lecture - miss a class and you can just review the book to see what you missed. Both the lectures and the book are fairly easy to understand.
Stanford University	Anthony Wagner	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	1060530	11/24/07	He is an awesome professor. Very approachable, knowledgeable, and excited about his area of study: Learning and Memory. Youll enjoy interacting with him,  he has a humble attitude too. BTW, hes hot!

Stanford University	Tom Wasow	3.4	1	Languages	150	3	4	2	4	247301	12/11/06	not bad, just not terribly interesting. he gives dull power-point lectures, usually sticks to outlining text-book material, and handles everything through his TAs. he is also very willing to talk about the material outside of class, and office hours are much more informative than classtime.
Stanford University	Tom Wasow	3.4	2	Languages	120	3	4	3	2	247301	8/30/05	none
Stanford University	Tom Wasow	3.4	2	Languages		4	5	5		247301	9/8/03	Unexciting, but extremely nice.
Stanford University	Tom Wasow	3.4	1	Languages		3	3	3	2	247301	11/28/05	the class wasn't too great, b/c Tom was at such a much higher level of understanding than everyone else -- conversations were very one-sided, or when he chose to let us take over, very uninteresting and uninsightful.

Stanford University	Thomas Weber	2.5	0	Engineering	241	2	2	2	4	1032579	3/16/11	He has a preoccupation with notation that I felt was not necessary for this level of course (save it for 341!). His lecture notes were inconsistent at times with his board writing, and there was no text to reinforce the concepts, which were explained poorly in class. I will avoid Weber for any future classes unless they're required for my degree.
Stanford University	Thomas Weber	2.5	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	1032579	9/26/07	One of the worst professors I've had. His final was so hard and poorly written, that he said "If you understood it completely, you should be teaching the class"
Stanford University	Thomas Weber	2.5	2	Engineering		2	5	4	4	1032579	3/13/09	This was a cool course. Lots of practical applications! I would recommend this if you are willing to put in some time. Prof has funny stories. Drawback: course only offered for 3 units.
Stanford University	Jeremy Weinstein	5.0	2	Political Science		1	5	5	5	936804	12/11/08	Great teacher
Stanford University	Jeremy Weinstein	5.0	2	Political Science		1	5	5	5	936804	1/3/07	Amazing professor, excellent at guiding discussion, incredibly intelligent, friendly, currently involved in the material he teaches, personally knows most authors used, and genuinely cares about helping people through his work. However, he assigns hundreds of pages of reading per week and difficult papers.
Stanford University	Jeremy Weinstein	5.0	2	Political Science		1	5	5	5	936804	2/22/07	Absolutely amazing professor! He cares about the subject and about his students.
Stanford University	Brian White	4.8	2	Mathematics	205	3	5	5	3	651084	12/15/10	Crystal clear teacher. Never saw a teacher with such clear teaching in class.
Stanford University	Brian White	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	651084	2/28/06	Professor White does a good job of clearly explaining mathematical concepts from a technical perspective, taking care to prove each of his theorems as he teaches. Easily one of the most popular professors of introductory math classes. Plus, he wears crazy Hawaiian shirts.
Stanford University	Brian White	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	651084	8/10/05	Best teacher I've had in the math department--no surprise he's the only lecturer you're allowed to have if you're in ACE (accelerated calculus for engineers.) Clear, fair, and makes it interesting
Stanford University	Brian White	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	651084	6/23/07	Prof. White is the BEST. Incredibly smart and can lecture without using any notes. His speaking style is such that you're always engaged. I took his class as an EE major and almost switched to math. He's really friendly in office hours and very personable too if you ever invite him to faculty night. Prof. White is a real treasure.
Stanford University	Brian White	4.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	651084	2/25/06	absolutely amazing. Everyone in every other lecture for math 51 this term ended up in professor white's lecture because he is simply that good.

Stanford University	Wojciech Wieczorek	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	3	4	899867	11/20/07	A bit difficult to understand, but definitely worth it. Very theoretical, but interesting guy.
Stanford University	Wojciech Wieczorek	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	2	899867	10/12/06	W. does a good job explaining everything he teaches. He has a slight (polish) accent, but it doesn't detract from his ability to elucidate concepts. He likes to assign really long and complicated problem sets.
Stanford University	Jonah Willihnganz	4.8	2	Writing		2	5	5	3	706008	4/13/06	Jonah is very clear in his expectations for each assignment. His classes are often very work-intensive, but he puts a lot of care into helping each student complete projects and papers successfully. He is especially helpful in individual conferences.
Stanford University	Jonah Willihnganz	4.8	2	Writing		1	4	4	3	706008	9/23/05	Jonah is frankly a bit of a hardass. He is incredibly smart, and a very good teacher in general. His one-on-one conferences are so very helpful, and he surprised me with his willingness to help. However, he is a very hard grader, and it often seems that his low grades are unwarranted for the work put in, and the direction he gave.
Stanford University	Jonah Willihnganz	4.8	2	Writing		1	5	5	3	706008	3/30/06	Extremely difficult course -- Jonah is a challenging professor, but chooses his assignments carefully and makes the drafting process very organic and helpful. He's also enormously approachable during office hours, and his suggestions are very helpful. For what it's worth, I thought his grading process seemed absolutely fair -- an amazing prof.
Stanford University	Jonah Willihnganz	4.8	2	Writing		2	5	5	3	706008	9/22/05	Jonah, though slightly stoic, is very clear and articulate in his lessons, assignments, and conferences. He has provided the most feedback on my papers more than any other teacher, but is particular and pretty difficult grader. Student conferences are extremely helpful and he will teach you to improve your writing but YOU must put in extra effort.
Stanford University	Jonathan Wise	2.0	0	Mathematics		3	3	1	3	1180337	12/9/08	Not a clear lecturer, but helpful in office hours. Reading the Levandovsky book (and the solutions to problem sets) is a better way to learn linear algebra than trying to understand lecture, which seems off the cuff and is riddled with errors.

Stanford University	Robert Waymouth	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	4	4	3	756856	8/16/07	He is good and clear but not nearly as interesting as Boxer. He can make you learn but he can't make you care.
Stanford University	Robert Waymouth	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	4	756856	11/28/05	Waymouth is a very clear and organized lecturer. He is also very helpful in office hours. Too much weight is put on each question on the tests in this class though.
Stanford University	Robert Waymouth	4.5	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	756856	3/14/06	Great lecturer (much better than Boxer). Provides great in-class examples that he works out step by step. If you can understand his examples and work out the book problems on your own the tests won't be a problem. I agree that each question counts for too much of the grade on midterms.
Stanford University	Robert Waymouth	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	4	4	5	756856	11/15/05	This class is most defintely NOT a repeat of AP Chemistry. Boxer and Waymouth go out of their way to make the testing material above and beyond rote calculation. Don't expect to see problems of the test's difficulty at any time before examination day.
Stanford University	Robert Weisberg	4.6	2	Law		4	5	5	5	852911	12/29/11	One of the best professors at SLS; only caveat is an occasional tendency to ramble and then have to rush through material to make up for it, but the rambling is almost always entertaining and informative in it's own right. Extraordinarily approachable both in and out of class- a must-take for anyone interested in criminal law.
Stanford University	Robert Weisberg	4.6	2	Law	123	3	5	5	5	852911	12/18/06	he's great
Stanford University	Robert Weisberg	4.6	2	Law		2	4	4	4	852911	6/18/08	Look up mensch in the OyED to find his picture. Old School in the sense that his progressive politics masks a reactionary streak. But what a great intellect and fine person even if he is caught up in the institutional politics. Great teacher but sometimes too disparaging of economics in attempt to uplift law and humanities.
Stanford University	Robert Weisberg	4.6	2	Law		2	5	4	4	852911	5/25/06	Great professor. Funny, really into the material. And cares about students and teaching a LOT. Not always the clearest at explaning things, and assigns a lot of reading. But more than makes up for it with his intelligence, wit, and dedication to teaching.

Stanford University	Jeffrey Wine	3.2	0	Psychology	121	2	1	2	4	67387	6/9/07	Professor Wine is a really nice guy, but this class was useless. Everyone in the class will get an A or a B (he told us this), but the exams are hard to anticipate and the readings are dense and incoherent at times. I would avoid this one.

Stanford University	Alex Woloch	2.6	2	English		1	5	5	5	352205	2/22/06	I've been in a few classes with Woloch and he's amazing: possibly the best close reader I've ever seen, and with a rare ability to formulate questions that get right to the heart of complex issues. (And, since you happen to mention hotness: SCORCHING.) Woloch's very hard, but you learn a lot.
Stanford University	Alex Woloch	2.6	2	English	300	2	5	3	4	352205	7/4/05	Try to take a class from Professor Woloch. He's a little shy, but he knows the 19th-century novel (and the novel form in general) better than any professor I've encountered so far. He requires you to think critically, so do all the reading and pay attention.

Stanford University	Alex Woloch	2.6	0	English	300	3	1	1	5	352205	9/26/05	Woloch is a very boring, long-winded mutterer. He is a minor character in his own existence.
Stanford University	Alex Woloch	2.6	0	English		3	1	1	1	352205	4/29/05	Boring, horrible atmosphere, very stuffy and unpleasant. Did not get the feeling that he had actually read the books or knew anything about literature. His knowlege of French is risible. AVOID
Stanford University	Susan Wyle	4.5	2	Writing		5	5	4	2	1230529	8/3/09	Susan is SUCH a character. She is an awesome teacher and makes class heaps of fun!
Stanford University	Sylvia Yanagisako	4.0	2	Anthropology		2	4	4	3	779766	12/14/05	Really hard exams, I seriously studied for days and still got a C+ on the Final. Pretty interesting course though, everything is based lectures. She looks a lot like Yoko Ono too =).
Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies		2	2	5	5	12875	10/19/10	My favorite undergrad prof. In Religious Studies. Also my advisor. He can be a bit intimidating because of his wealth of knowledge, and at times elusive and difficult to get ahold of...however his style and mere presence can enthrall even non-RS students. A great man if I might, an inestimable influence to me personallym. Check out his seminar!
Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies		3	4	4	5	12875	8/22/06	Fantastic in a seminar, very intelligent. Shows a genuine interest not only in your learning the material but also in your development as a person (may be a good or bad thing for you depending on what you want out of a professor)
Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies		4	5	4	2	12875	12/12/05	One of the wisest men you will ever meet.

Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies	271	4	5	5	5	12875	11/22/06	Simply amazing; personally, my favorite professor of all time. Brilliant, astoundingly well-read, skilled pedagogue, a little arrogant, but whatever. You will not only learn a lot about the subject of the class/seminar, but probably about yourself, too. You owe it to yourself to take at least one of his classes.
Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies		3	4	5	3	12875	4/4/06	extremely intelligent and knowledgable, but can seem to be extremely arrogant and cynical. dont let my personal feelings put you off however, cos he's a great professor.
Stanford University	Lee Yearley	4.2	2	Religious Studies		3	5	4	3	12875	11/15/05	Articulate and thoughtful, makes IHUM enjoyable (which would seem to be a paradox).

Stanford University	Patrick Young	4.4	1	Computer Science	108	4	1	4	5	824987	8/24/10	Took CS108, the intro to object-oriented programming. The first few lectures put me to sleep. The rest weren't necessary, apparently; I didn't go. I got an A in this otherwise useful project class, and my only interaction with Prof. Young worth mentioning was a question he couldn't answer.

Stanford University	Patrick Young	4.4	2	Computer Science	105	5	5	5	5	824987	4/12/07	Dr. Young is way cool. CS105 changed my life. Made me want to drop out of school and just design webpages.
Stanford University	Patrick Young	4.4	2	Computer Science	105	5	5	5	5	824987	11/9/06	Really enjoyed this class, Patrick really makes sure that you understand the material. He wrote the book, so he lectures in a similar "straight forward" manner. Very nice guy, more people should laugh at his dry humor.
Stanford University	Patrick Young	4.4	2	Computer Science	106	5	5	5	4	824987	4/4/06	Extremely friendly once you get to know him. Come to his office hour and chat with him. Knowledgable and understand what it's like to be an undergraduate. Great lecturer. His exams can be challenging but study and you'll be fine.

Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	0	Languages	204	1	1	1	1	227578	1/2/13	Terrible. Horrible personality. Impossible to work with
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		5	5	5	4	227578	12/18/11	Tough but you learn a lot from her. Keep up with her high expectations and both you and Zeng laoshi will be happy with the results.
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		1	5	5	3	227578	5/5/08	Best teacher ever- she is very committed to student success and wants every student to do well. Tough, but her high expectations pay off with how well you'll be able to speak Chinese at the end...
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		1	5	4	4	227578	4/11/07	Firm and fair. She's not afraid to tell you that you were lazy on a homework assignment, but she'll go out of her way to answer questions if you ask. She's no nonsense, exactly how a good language teacher should be. A phenomenal teacher!
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages	123	4	4	4	5	227578	6/26/06	She's very strict and yells at students so many times, but she's indeed very kind and helpful. She wanted us to get serious about learning Chinese. If you do the work and get serious, she will be very kind to you. otherwise, you might get killed in class.:-)
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	227578	3/9/06	a good teacher, but she expects a lot from you. you'll do well in the class if you work at it consistently every day, but if you're not prepared, watch out. She's strict and won't hesitate to scold you in front of all your classmates.
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		2	5	5		227578	12/29/03	She's a very good language teacher, but a tad harsh. She yelled at a senior for being late to the oral.
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		1	4	5	2	227578	7/12/12	I had Zeng Laoshi when I studied Chinese 1 my senior year at Stanford. I live in China now and constantly get compliments on my clear pronunciation and solid grammar, which I credit to the solid foundation I received in her course. She's tough, but the results are amazing.
Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		1	4	3	4	227578	7/22/10	SO MEAN. SWTICH out! you have options, get out quick!

Stanford University	Hong Zeng	3.9	2	Languages		1	3	4	5	227578	4/1/06	pretty much made coming to class a torturous experience. i think i cried after class on a weekly basis because she's so harsh. if you're not brilliant (or you dont have parents who speak chinese) expect to get chewed out regularly. i regret to say that her harshness sort of killed my interest in the subject.

Stanford University	Tobias Wolff	4.2	2	English		3	4	4	5	12871	3/13/07	His lectures were interesting, and original. While he was kind, he had a bit of an ego. Overall, I would take another class with him.
Stanford University	Tobias Wolff	4.2	2	English		2	5	5	5	12871	11/10/05	I took this class spring 1999. Prof. Wolff was the kindest teacher I've ever had; he helped me through a really rough time. He showed me that it doesn't take much to connect with another human being. I have since graduated and teach English at another college. He is my role model. I will always remember his kindness to me during that time.

Stanford University	Gavin Wright	3.5	1	Economics		4	3	2		154231	7/7/03	Avoid Econ with Prof Wright. The lectures have little relation with exams

Stanford University	Haipeng Xing	1.5	0	Mathematics	243	1	2	1	5	1010075	7/23/07	My god the WORST at explaining concepts, very unclear. Not enough rigor, makes huge leaps in derivations. Very thick accent also, overall a poor experience.
Stanford University	Dimitry Yandulov	3.2	2	Chemistry	203	3	4	3	4	803088	10/30/08	He is a good person that lives for his work. He needs to enjoy life more. He is very caring under his serious look.
Stanford University	Dimitry Yandulov	3.2	2	Chemistry	136	4	5	3	2	803088	4/18/07	Dima is one of the best three professors in the chem dept. His social skills are lacking, and he has trouble retaining graduate students, but he does show serious concern about whether his undergrad students are learning. He came to lab for a couple hours every day, and personally instructed us on lab technique. A real asset to Stanford chem.
Stanford University	Dimitry Yandulov	3.2	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	2	803088	1/23/06	this guy is a jerk.
Stanford University	Dimitry Yandulov	3.2	2	Chemistry	136	1	5	4	3	803088	8/16/07	He is the most useful of all the Professors.

Stanford University	Dimitry Yandulov	3.2	1	Chemistry	136	4	4	2	1	803088	12/6/06	Dima was really good; He really cared about how students were doing.He stayed around lab usually to answer any questions we had; he was really helpful in teaching us technique and lab skills. Assignments were reasonable; they weren't too hard and didn't take too much time.People I know like him a lot; he was by far the best lab prof. we'v had.

Stanford University	Julie Zelenski	4.2	0	Computer Science	107	1	1	1	4	183250	12/2/11	She can be a bit much with her fake enthusiasm and like the guy before me said is not very helpful if you have any questions.

Stanford University	Julie Zelenski	4.2	2	Computer Science	106	3	5	5	4	183250	1/30/07	Awesome lecturer, fun lectures
