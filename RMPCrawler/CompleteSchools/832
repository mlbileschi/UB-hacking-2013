St. Bonaventure University	Mary Adekson	4.1	2	Education	510	2	5	5	5	516784	1/17/07	Dr. Adekson is a very engaging and well informed Counselor educator with a wealth of applicable experience that she utilizes in this class. I also admire and enjoyed the diversity and cultural back ground that she has to offer. This intro class was very comprehensive and worth every dime that I paid to take the course.

Great lady but her classes are elementary and her teaching style is dry and non-engaging. She reads us sentences out of our textbooks for the entire class and then wants us to write notes, it's in the book!
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Adekson	4.1	2	Education		4	5	4	5	516784	3/28/05	Dr. Adekson was a great professor. She was very caring about her students and making sure each of understood the material. She was willing to work with each of us 1:1 to further our understanding.

She is a jewel of a teacher because you don't realize how valuable she is until she is no longer under your skin, prompting you to do it this way...

St. Bonaventure University	Mary Adekson	4.1	2	Education		5	5	3	4	516784	1/20/05	A simple yet informative class. Professor brings true like experience to class.

St. Bonaventure University	Susan Anders	3.9	2	Accounting	202	2	4	5	3	97045	1/18/05	Teaches accounting well because she is very knowledgeable and teaches everything clearly. However, she does not make it fun or interesting in any way. She does use enough examples and when she does, they are never good. She is a nice lady though who is willing to help you if you stop by her office.
St. Bonaventure University	Susan Anders	3.9	0	Accounting	201	1	1	1	1	97045	11/14/04	Worst teacher I've ever had. For her notes, all she does is re-write what you can find in the textbook. Nothing is explained with any clarity whatsoever. Our last test average was a 73% and she said she was pleased with that. I'm changing my major because, if accounting is like this, it sucks.

St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	2	5	4	2	92174	3/24/10	He is a great teacher and explains the work very well. Class can be sometimes boring but participation is key to passing his Int Jorney class.
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	0	Theology	101	3	2	2	1	92174	10/24/08	Terrible professor. Thinks that his views are the only views. If you are an arrogant liberal then take his class, but even so your opinion won't matter anyways.

St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	2	4	3	2	92174	4/4/07	Classes may be boring, but he knows what he is talking about. I learned quite a bit in his class and he is passionate in his teaching. It may seem like he is mad at the world, but I believe he truly enjoys what he does. He is there for one reason: to teach what he knows. Plus, he gives many chances for students to get extra credit.
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	3	4	4	1	92174	12/22/06	Class is very boring but is also easy. Can easily get a B without doing most of the readings. Very helpful during office hours
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	3	4	5	4	92174	5/4/06	All you people that gave Dr. A a bad rating are dumb and should kiss an ass. Dr. A, although challenging, prepares us for other difficult courses, and he is demanding how a UNIVERSITY professor should be, unlike some of the jokes teaching here. Dr. A is an excellent teacher.
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	0	Theology		1	1	1	1	92174	12/12/05	hated having him in class. BORING, DULL, Not an ideal teacher
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	0	Theology		1	1	1	1	92174	9/17/05	This "man" was the worst prof i have ever had. he never listens to what your opinion is and when you don't participate, he gets pissed off. i would never recommend him to everybody and if you do happen to get him, get wasted before every class so that its easier to pass out during it.
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	3	4	5	3	92174	5/16/10	Very boring! easy to pass the class who ever get lower then an A is because they REALLY DID NOT TRY. his point system is crazy easy [unlimited extra credit midterm easy final easier!!]the only bad thing is that you do read the whole book! but on the other hand his class discussions are very interesting and he loves to argue![specially wen reading S
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	2	Theology	101	5	4	4	3	92174	3/17/10	Apczynski has a bad rep but isn't that bad. There's not a whole lot of work involved in his class and you can get by with not doing the readings some of the time. If you have conservative political views you probably should not take his class. If you're not easily offended his class is a peace of cake and he's a cool guy
St. Bonaventure University	John Apczynski	2.3	0	Theology	101	1	1	1	1	92174	4/2/08	if you're looking for a bad grade, by all means sign up for his class.

St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance		1	5	4	4	775891	5/24/11	Giles is an excellent professor. He is very smart and does his best to teach a really difficult Stats-II class. I really enjoyed his funny stories and interesting trivia. Overall try to take Giles, because although it might be tough you will be benefited in the long term.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	212	2	5	5	3	775891	4/30/10	Giles is the shi! He was my favorite prof at Bonas. Everyone should have to take a macro/micro econ class before they can claim adulthood.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	1	Finance	211	1	4	2	2	775891	11/11/08	Giles is the man, hes never made us buy a single book, however, he has no respect for idiots and slow learners, so if you cant teach yourself things like simple economics and statistics dont take his classes
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	1	Finance	102	2	3	2	3	775891	12/14/07	SO FUN to be around... dont go to class. print every single note and memorize it front to back.. then you will do fine. class lectures seem irrelevant to what's actually on tests.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	322	2	5	5	5	775891	5/11/07	Giles Bootheway is easily one of the top professors at SBU and is my personal favorite. Giles is so funny he could make you laugh at a funeral. But don't let his joking hide his intelligence, a true genius. Bootheway for Prez.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	322	3	5	5	5	775891	5/10/07	Giles is a good man and a great professor, even though he did like making fun of me during class every day. He is a great story teller, and loves letting the class know when Barry Gan and other mischievous professors are wandering about. If you have an interest in penny stocks, take him, as I am sure you'll have a fun time.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	1	Finance	322	2	3	3	4	775891	5/8/07	Tests are all regurgitatating lists and memorizing weird calculations. Class is usually quite fun though, but tests do not accurately reflect knowledge of material.

St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance		3	5	5	2	775891	5/8/06	For such a difficult class he really couldn't have made it more fun. He is truly an awesome teacher and a hell of an interesting guy!
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	102	3	5	5	3	775891	2/8/06	Giles is the man. I would take him again in a second. His lectures are amusing and he gives examples for almost all the material he covers. I actually liked going to his class. Take him if you can- hes awesome.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance		4	5	5	5	775891	2/1/06	great man! loves teaching, tells the best finance stories about his old days on the floor.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	1	Finance		2	3	2	4	775891	1/31/06	Funny, but can be offensive. The class is interesting, yon't be bored. Has you buy a $140 book that will actually hurt you if you use it. It wastes your time to srudy from the book. If you can find him he'll spend time to help you out.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	321	4	5	5	5	775891	1/27/06	awesome teacher, take him if you get a chance, he's a lot of fun
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	0	Finance	102	1	1	1	5	775891	12/9/05	Does not test what he teached in class. Very educated, but doesn't know how to break the material down to students. Very unwilling to help after class. believe you should understand everything in class the first time.
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance	321	4	5	5	5	775891	2/1/06	Great teacher who really knows his stuff...Tells great stories about his pet racoon and his POS mazda....Bootheway is the man
St. Bonaventure University	Giles Bootheway	3.9	2	Finance		5	5	5	5	775891	1/30/06	Giles is a great professor, the kid that had him for ECO 102 down there must have been dumb as rocks and of course Bootheway has no respect for total idiots.. But seriously, he's not that hard because he's excellent at explaining everything with stories and humor... I've learned a lot from him. 5 stars. *****

St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Borgeson	4.3	2	Sociology		4	3	5	5	175602	11/10/04	awesome teacher... always a good timein his class

The tests are extremely hard but if you read the assigned chapters you will get a decent grade for the class. He's a nice guy, but he makes you feel dumb sometimes. If you put work into his classes, you'll get a good grade, but you have to go above and beyond for an A.

St. Bonaventure University	Susan Abraham	4.1	2	Theology	401	3	5	5	4	201468	4/9/05	Susan is the best professor I've had. She will challenge you to do the best work you've done, and she will introduce you to new possibilities and points of view. If you're willing to work, she'll put all her energy into helping you - and you'll come out of her class shocked at how much you know.

St. Bonaventure University	Bob Amico	4.4	2	Philosophy	108	5	5	4	4	8310	11/11/07	Some people say Amico is brain washing, but that's a really harsh way to put it. If you're open to different idea's, it won't seem that way. He doesn't push his own thoughts on you at all. There are quizzes every day, but honestly there's not hard. Even if you don't read you'll probably do fine just using common sense. It's an easy and fun class.
St. Bonaventure University	Bob Amico	4.4	2	Philosophy	108	4	5	5	5	8310	11/8/06	Amico is the best teacher. He gives students a chance to think outside of the box.

St. Bonaventure University	Bob Amico	4.4	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	2	8310	3/15/06	He is very passionate about the class and tries to get students to be passionate about the subject as well. The class is overall very easy but slightly boring due to its repetitiveness.

He's no so much a brainwasher as he is completely unwilling to take anyone else's opinion into consideration.

St. Bonaventure University	Bob Amico	4.4	0	Philosophy	108	5	2	2	1	8310	3/27/07	He is an easy grader, but pushes his views down your throat and if you do not agree or stand up to him in class and challenge him, your grade reflects that. Class is easy, but repetative.
St. Bonaventure University	Bob Amico	4.4	2	Philosophy	108	4	4	4	2	8310	10/16/06	Like said before, this teacher uses his class to brainwash the students. He is a hardcore liberal, so if you are liberal I would recommend his course. If you are Republican, like me, I can not stand it. A lot of the things he PREACHES are inaccurate, misleading, or lies.

St. Bonaventure University	Steven Andrianoff	3.8	2	Computer Science	131	4	5	4	5	174766	12/19/07	VERY anal about documenting and indenting... Always asks if someone has a question... Sometimes seems to expect a lot out of students but is a very fair professor and sociable. If you show up to class and do homework he'll like you and you'll be fine.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Andrianoff	3.8	2	Computer Science		5	3	5	1	174766	12/13/04	Absolutely no personality, makes you want to fall asleep. Teaches material very logically, going very slow so that everyone understands. As long as you take notes and look them over before tests and quizzes, very easy.

St. Bonaventure University	Laurie Branch	5.0	2	Finance	301	4	5	5	5	1670595	12/17/11	Laurie is by far the nicest, most wonderful teacher I've ever had. If you don't take her during your tenor at Bonaventure, you're missing out. I mean, who doesn't like free giftcards?

St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	3	4	5	3	92183	3/24/13	I am in a class where it is mostly people who are retaking the class, and I can see why. He makes sure that you know everything after you are done with the class. If you do not understand something just speak up and he is willing to explain it so you do understand it. He loves pop quizes so the best thing to do is review your notes every day.
St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	2	5	5	5	92183	12/17/12	Great teacher. Highly recommended. He will teach a lot of material and it's a lot to learn, but in the end you actually retain quite a bit of knowledge. He's pretty crazy, but a whole lot of fun too. One of the smartest men you'll ever meet. And do the Journals! Not the Paper!
St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	2	3	4	5	92183	11/14/11	Dr. Brown is an amazing professor who does want you to succeed but he also wants you to learn the material necessary for a future career in education or psychology. You'll learn a lot as long as you focus and study what you need to. Also, don't let his cockiness get in the way of learning because it just might!

At first you will hate him, but you'll learn to love him and eventually he will be your favorite teacher. He knows what he is talking about and whatever he tells you will be on the test. The tests are easy if you study for them and pay attention in class. It's really a pretty easy class if you actually put effort into it
St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	1	4	4	4	92183	12/17/08	Brown is amazing! He is an intense man but he does care about what he does. Brown does not put up with a lot but if you are on his good side, your golden! He is one of my favorite professors here.

St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	3	4	5	4	92183	12/23/12	Brown is a really good teacher. He is quite arrogant but he has a reason. If you go to class it is impossible not to learn the material. Take good notes, review them before class, and DO THE JOURNALS and you won't have any problem getting an A.
St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	500	2	5	5	3	92183	12/17/12	He can be a little intimidating at first but once you get to know him he's a lot of fun and makes you want to come to class. He's a tough grader, but that was a nice change, I felt that I earned my grade. Very honest but helpful, I never felt intimidated asking questions in class or by email. Great guy, very passionate and intelligent. Must take!
St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	2	3	5	3	92183	11/18/10	This is an amazing class and you don't have the option of not learning a lot because he is such a good teacher of drilling the materials into your brain.

St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology	210	2	3	5	4	92183	10/23/08	This by far was the most amazing class I have ever taken at Bonaventure! Everyday I learned amazing fact I never Knew before. Make sure you take notes and review them every day before class because you never know when he is going to give you a pop quiz! Do the journals as your project it sounds like more work but in the end it's easier!

St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	0	Psychology	210	1	1	2	2	92183	3/21/08	HE IS THE MOST ARROGANT AND SHALLOW PERSON I HAVE HAD AS A TEACHER. IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH IS SARCASM. HE IS USELESS WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING.

St. Bonaventure University	Adam Brown	4.1	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	92183	9/8/05	Human Development was one if the best classes I have taken, and Prof. Brown has been one of the best teachers I have had in my two years there... Keep up the good work prof.

St. Bonaventure University	E. Bysiek	4.3	0	Accounting	201	2	2	1	2	1170364	6/26/09	So the guy is smart, eloquent, and well spoken... he seems laid back and you can hear it in his voice, to the point where you might fall asleep... only one problem i have with him... he forgets that the student in his class can read, if he could just put things in is own words and (dumb it down) he would make the class a lot easier.

St. Bonaventure University	 Cardinale	2.5	0	Journalism		3	2	2	5	744796	11/2/05	Totally unfair professor. Will not reward those who hand in papers on time but will reward those who don't and those who speak out rudely in class...go figure. Hands out all outdated materials. Does not speak clearly so is almost impossible to understand. Unfair grader.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cardinale	2.5	0	Journalism		3	1	1	1	744796	11/2/05	Toally sucks as far as being fair. He'll accept papers from obnoxious idiots who interrupt class constantly 2 or 3 weeks late. But if you hand it in on time and do what is asked of you, you won't be rewarded. He lets you write however you want and tells you how it won't be like this when you get a real job, so it's just a waste of time.

St. Bonaventure University	Nancy Casey	3.8	0	Education		3	1	2	NULL	173101	11/6/03	She definately has her favorites! I was not into the whole cut and paste elementary tedious education major idea. I love how all of those people in that major complain about getting up for student teaching; you are actually doing what you set out to do!
St. Bonaventure University	Nancy Casey	3.8	2	Education		3	4	4	NULL	173101	4/29/03	I love you Nancy!!!! Thanks for all your help!!!

St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	3	318967	12/10/12	Very nice person... terrible teacher. I am a math major and even i couldn't understand the material put in front of me. He is very poor at explaining things and is it is very hard to study when you have no idea what you are looking at. His tests are IMPOSSIBLE!
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	201	4	5	5	5	318967	7/20/10	I'm not sure if this is meant to be about Elizabeth Cashing or a different (male) professor because a lot of these ratings are about a male prof. But I mean to rate Elizabeth Cashing.. GREAT teacher. She really helps you with everything, is understanding and kind, and makes every lesson fun. I was never bored in her class, and I learned so much!
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	122	4	5	4	4	318967	1/19/10	Pretty good teacher. Makes sure nobody is lost by asking after every problem. He actually seems to get upset when there isn't a question. He enjoys teaching and will help you as much as he can. One of the better math teachers I've had at bonas
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	207	5	5	5	5	318967	12/19/08	Excellent professor... Takes an intrest in the student's work... Follows a well defined syllabus... Take him!
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	151	2	5	5	3	318967	2/7/08	Really really nice guy. Suffers that flaw that comes with being a math teacher: if you dont get something he looks at you like your mentally retarded...but he'll always answer your questions. He' also works with kids, and doesnt just give up if they arent good at math.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	151	1	1	1	2	318967	11/27/07	Horrible.... This guy never explains anyhting.. you have to be on his level or your not passing... sorry that were not all math majors

St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	107	1	3	1	1	318967	12/18/06	Very hard class
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics	107	2	3	2	2	318967	10/18/06	Definitely knows statistics, but not so good at teaching it. Most of class consists of him yammering on about statistics concepts and formulas. If you're an example-oriented learner, this guy's not for you.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	121	4	5	5	3	318967	12/23/05	just do your homework that he gives, then you'll do fine.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	111	2	1	1	1	318967	10/7/11	He is absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had. He's denied myself and others help numerous times. His teaching method is absolutely horrible. I'm glad he's not allowed to teach this course anymore.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	151	2	3	4	3	318967	5/19/10	not mandatory attendance but doing hw and going to class will translate into performance on tests
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	111	1	1	1	3	318967	3/18/09	Worst math teacher ever... so boring and just repeats the same thing over and over and over... i learned NOTHING... useless for education majors.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	107	2	1	2	4	318967	12/19/08	He is a math teacher, who thinks he is a philosopher but really just likes hearing the sound of his own voice. He also thinks his ideas are better than what is presented in the text. However he teaches STATS.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics	121	2	3	2	1	318967	12/13/07	The guys obviously extremely educated in mathmatics but his teaching skills need work. Bad at answering questions. I didnt do any homework and got a B, but our class started off with 25 and only 9 were left for the final
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	151	1	1	1	1	318967	11/1/07	not good teacher, never explains things even when you ask him in class.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics	107	1	3	2	1	318967	3/4/07	He is a good guy, but a really difficult teacher. I wouldn't suggest taking him unless you really are up for a challenge and don't mind getting a B or lower.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	112	2	2	1	4	318967	12/14/06	Not a good teacher..encourages going to ask questions in his office but doesnt answer the questions you ask..do not take
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	151	2	1	1	1	318967	10/17/06	worst class im taking right now, not helpful, doesnt care to be. makes a point of saying "golly" or "jeepers" every class more than he makes a point of getting any message across.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	201	4	5	5	5	318967	11/21/05	great
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	121	3	4	3	4	318967	11/10/05	You will learn
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics	121	2	4	2	2	318967	11/1/05	He is not a great teacher but does know what he talks about. He will help you if you need help!
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	4	318967	8/30/05	Very good teacher. Helpful whenever you need it. He can be a riot once you get to know him.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	2	Mathematics	121	3	4	4	2	318967	3/14/05	I didnt think he was bad at all. His tests werent that hard and I am really bad at math. everything for this class was review from high school. i didnt do any of the homework and still had a B+. Doing the homework would make for an easy A with anyone who has a base knowledge of high school math.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	NULL	318967	9/8/04	He's the worst teacher. I though Cox was a bad teacher. You don't know what bad is until you have him. The day he explains a hole problem will be the day that i might pass his class

St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics	208	1	1	1	NULL	318967	12/12/03	he the worst teacher ever. he does a terrible job of explaining things and when you think you understand the homework (even if you have a perfect homework average) you are still going to fail his tests, half the class was failing at midterms. hes aweful.
St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	1	Mathematics	121	2	4	2	2	318967	11/8/05	At first, he was an ass. He didnt want to help . He got alot of complants and he has totally turned his teaching and everything over. He gives quizs every class but he keeps 10 of the possibly 30. His tests arent hard at all. Alot of students dont like him but i do. I had a D- @ the midterm but got a A in the class. IF you jus try, you'll do fine

St. Bonaventure University	 Cashing	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	318967	9/8/04	Worst professor in this institution, how the hell did they make this guy head of the math department?

St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	1	Languages	201	2	3	3	3	111732	12/27/09	not very funny. kind of annoying. takes off too many points for things wrong on a test. need a 96 to get an A. I mean, she's not bad, but there are other profs who are better.
St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	1	Languages	102	4	3	3	3	111732	4/1/07	umm... sometimes she has no clue what she's talking about, and i think she might make some of the stuff up, not sure. but she has a different scarf every day, it makes for a great distraction.
St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	1	Languages		3	2	3	2	111732	11/8/05	She is crazy! I don't know hoe i got an A in her class, I had no idea what was going on! She will help you if you need it but it probably won't be all that helpful cause you can't understand her. Take Professor Simone instead
St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	1	Languages		4	4	2	1	111732	12/20/04	All I can say is, " NO peeky peekyyyy!" and "Am I speaking Chinese?!?"
St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	2	Languages	201	5	5	4	5	111732	11/4/04	Love Dr. Cellini, she is very helpful. I recommend coming to class because you will have quizzes on fridays periodically also she does class participation. and you will have homework everyday that isnt graded.
St. Bonaventure University	Alva Cellini	3.1	0	Languages	200	3	2	2	NULL	111732	4/13/04	Know this, you learners of Italian - Dr. Cellini has a penchant for completely reversing grammar rules, speaking Spanish, not catching Spanish spoken, and not preparing her lesson plans! SO FRUSTRATING!

St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	1	Chemistry	301	3	3	2	5	495445	9/12/11	nice!
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	1	1	495445	2/11/09	OMG This woman made chem lab 101 the most horrendous experience imaginable. She talks for 45 minutes AT LEAST for pre-lab, and doesn't let you have any extra time at the end even if other profs allow it for super long labs. Writing in pen is mandatory, and she takes of points for scribbling and every sigfig error. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	2	Chemistry	301	1	4	4	3	495445	12/16/07	Organic is a very hard course. Dr. Brestensky is a good person and tries her best to make the material understandable. Her grading is her one fall. She is too concerned about the minor details and takes points off for things that shouldn't lose points. She does however give bonus points and if you work hard you can get the grade.
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	1	3	495445	2/2/06	pretty much the worst teacher ever
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry		2	1	1	5	495445	10/11/05	Good professor... if you enjoy doing unnecessary busy work in lab that prevents you from getting to the important things and love getting point off on your exams because she refuses to give anyone an extra few minutes (even if the whole class is not finished)... too bad she's the only organic teacher... no way out on this one
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	495445	11/14/04	brestensky sucks. she doesnt know how to teach
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	2	Chemistry	301	1	5	4	4	495445	7/21/09	Yep. She's hard. She is actually interested in you learning though, and will try to help you in her own way. She tries to make things interesting and applicable and works the course so that passing is more about the mind numbing amount of work you put in more than your natural ability at orgo.
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry	302	1	1	1	1	495445	5/15/08	The WORST professor at Bonaventure. She is not concerned with students doing well but rather wants them to do bad. She is also extremely disorganized and the worst grader. It is already the end of the semester and she still hasnt given midterm grades. Honestly take this course with anyone else. She cannot teach!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	1	Chemistry	301	1	3	3	1	495445	5/9/07	News flash, it's organic chemistry did you think it was going to be easy? She teaches a very hard class and does a good job at it.
St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	495445	12/11/05	worst possible class ever!!!!!!!!!!! seriously, take it somewhere else if you can....DONT TAKE IT WITH HER!

St. Bonaventure University	Donna Brestensky	2.3	2	Chemistry		1	4	3	3	495445	11/11/04	this class is very hard. the exams are hard. but i heard she curves your final grade and if you put forth an honest effort she will pass you. she deffinitly isnt the greatest at explaining things (lectures are kinda confusing) for lab she tries to make you do way too much.

True what's said below about hard tests but overall every day all you had to do was show up take notes and he was happy. Very helpful, willing to make other arrangements around a student's schedule.

St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	2	Theology	101	2	5	4	3	8309	4/29/10	This is required for first semester freshmen/transfers. Caution: the class is not easy. Texts are difficult & new to most students. Dr. Bychkov is extremely knowledgeable (he read the texts in the original languages!) & you can learn more from a tough teacher. Plus, he does allow make up participation. if you read/study, this class can be rewarding
St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	0	Theology	101	1	1	1	2	8309	10/28/09	extremely boring class! it's all about participation. he'll ask for your opinion then tell you it's wrong. he expects you to be knowledgeable in religion and talk about it so if you're not religious, good luck! bottom line: he's very opinionated and NEVER take his class! oh and he's russian and has a veryyy thick accent, HARD TO UNDERSTAND!
St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	1	Theology	109	4	3	3	4	8309	12/5/08	Oleg Bychkov is a wonder of a man, a true example of the essence of human existence. Humored by the small things in life, his eccentricity (probably just an off-shoot of his foreign nature) fills the room with laughter, smiles, snoring...unfortunately everything but learning. He is a big child. But we love him all the same...just like a teddy bear.

St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	0	Theology	107	1	1	1	3	8309	12/10/09	Bychkov is one of the worst teachers I've ever had. If you have any choice at all, find someone else to take the course with. He's grades participation heavily, but if you try to participate and give opinions, he'll laugh and say you're wrong. Won't give out evaluations for you to fill out because he knows they're all bad anyway.
St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	2	Theology	101	3	3	4	4	8309	3/29/09	I'm one of the few that actually liked this guy. I learned a lot from the readings and I did well in his class. You have to participate in class. I can't tell you how many times I didn't read the entire reading the night before but saved my grade by discussing what I did read.

I wrote a 8 page paper and he stop grading it in the middle and gave me a F, for no reson.
St. Bonaventure University	Oleg Bychkov	1.9	1	Theology	101	4	3	2	4	8309	10/11/04	Although he spent a few years in Toronto, the thick Russian accent may have you thinking about a communist infiltration than the scholarly works of St. Bonaventure or Thomas Merton.

He is very helpful and always available after class when I needed some help understanding certain topics. He is a very strict grader, especially on essays, it is not that he is unfair, he just expects alot from his students. you will find that every student with a logical thought that tries their hardest to get everything they can into an essay gets the same grade as the next one. the key is DETAILS! :)

I had almost no interest in the content of this class before I took it. Prof DeSimone really got me interested in it though. It is hard to show how passionate you are during an online course but Prof DeSimone did. Even if it is not required take her class

St. Bonaventure University	Robert Donius	4.9	2	Religion	207	4	5	5	4	1688143	11/5/12	Very Good teacher. Gives online quizzes every week. They are very easy and he is willing to help you what whatever you want. He also assigns I believe 3 essays throughout the course but they are so super easy and he grades so great. Get him if you can. Such a nice guy
St. Bonaventure University	Robert Donius	4.9	2	Religion	206	4	5	5	3	1688143	5/14/12	This class is a piece of cake. As long as you do the papers, quizzes and attend the class you will get a good grade. He made the class interesting
St. Bonaventure University	Robert Donius	4.9	2	Religion	207	4	5	5	4	1688143	11/2/12	He is an amazing professor. His essays are very straight forward and the quizzes that we take every week and based on the chapter that you talk about in class. Just ansering the questions in the back of the chapter will help ALOT while taking those quizzes. I RECOMMEND him to anyone who needs to take CATH FRAN! :-)
St. Bonaventure University	Robert Donius	4.9	2	Religion	206	4	4	5	1	1688143	3/27/12	Tests were all papers and were really easy. A big part of your grade is attendance so just show up and do the papers and you will get a good grade. He is really nice and the class wasn't bad overall
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Dooley	2.1	0	Philosophy		2	1	1	4	535553	11/22/11	Dooley spent the entire two semesters I had him using his classes as a soap box to complain about whatever was bothering him that day. He made fun of students (not in a friendly way) and went so far as to call people from my hometown inbred hillbillies. Should have retired 30 years ago.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Dooley	2.1	2	Philosophy		3	3	4	5	535553	5/12/05	I had Dr. Dooley for metaphysics at Bonaventure in the mid 90s. I thought he was excellent. His class was challenging, and some students thought he was a bit aloof, but I always gave him credit. He knew his stuff, and he engaged students. I still remember stuff about Konstantin Kolenda, and Hylas.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Dooley	2.1	1	Philosophy		4	3	3	3	535553	8/24/05	didn't like him, didn't like his choices for class... we spent about 2 months on a river runs through it when we could have been learning about art, music, and classic literature
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Dooley	2.1	0	Philosophy		1	1	1	2	535553	12/18/04	DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! HE IS SOOOO BAD, AND DOES NOT TEACH WELL AT ALLLLLL....HES A MEAN MEAN MAN!

St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology	105	4	5	5	5	478658	12/2/04	I really enjoyed having Professor Clarke. It's one of the few classes that I actually enjoy going to. I believe he's an easy grader & the weekly assignments WILL help to boost your grade. The topics are interesting and relevant. He makes you examine the opinions you possess & WHY you have them.
St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology	413	4	4	5	5	478658	11/9/04	very interesting topics. Easy to do good as long as you do the work. Not a hard grader
St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology		3	5	5	3	478658	10/25/04	Every monday and friday you have quizzes. Monday on reading and friday on stuff you talk about in class (Easy). A weekly, short reflection paper due every week. No mid-term, no tests, no final exam. Just talk to him about a grade you want and he'll do his best to help you achieve it.
St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology	105	4	4	5	5	478658	12/13/04	This guy really makes sociology discussions interesting. I actually enjoyed coming to class, go figure! A good amount of reading and writing papers to do, but not hard if you just follow his guidelines.
St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology	101	4	4	5	5	478658	11/10/04	Good ass dude. The class was very interesting and always kept me listening. Work is defintely work but you will enjoy doing the majority of it, i reccomend him
St. Bonaventure University	Kevin Clarke	4.7	2	Sociology	105	3	5	5	3	478658	11/4/04	I love prof.

St. Bonaventure University	Joe Coate	3.1	1	Accounting	401	1	2	4	4	173225	5/19/10	only answers questions with more questions. is terrible to go and talk to about grade. only gives a set number of A's per class. tests were impossible because of amount of information

St. Bonaventure University	Joe Coate	3.1	2	Accounting		2	5	5	NULL	173225	3/26/03	The best class I have ever taken at St. Bonaventure. Prof Coate challenges you to think, and analyze information, and classwork is very open ended.
St. Bonaventure University	Joe Coate	3.1	0	Accounting	201	2	2	2	1	173225	5/19/10	Coate is not very helpful. You ask a question, he gives you a snotty answer, and you'll probably have even less knowledge than you did before you asked him. He started off the very first day by ignoring the attendance sheet and jumping right into the material. Very overwhelming. The only way I passed was through his curves and my own BS
St. Bonaventure University	Joe Coate	3.1	1	Accounting	202	2	3	3	3	173225	9/12/07	Good guy, tests are very hard but you only need 80% to get an A. He gives you a lot of points for showing up to class and labs. Labs are very helpful because the class moves so fast.
St. Bonaventure University	Joe Coate	3.1	2	Accounting	308	2	5	5	NULL	173225	4/22/03	Somehow made cost accounting interesting. Tests are extremely hard, but he curves to be fair.

St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	3	5	4	3	1622157	5/7/12	He was very helpful with everything, was willing to go over questions on the practice tests multiple times and really got me interested in physics
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	1	Physics	104	4	3	3	1	1622157	5/3/12	Some degree of busy work but it really does help to boost your grade. DON'T FORGET YOUR JOURNALS!
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	4	5	5	2	1622157	4/27/12	Incredible professor, one of the best I've ever had, works really hard to make sure students understand. Puts in effort above and beyond what's needed. Fantastic Moodle site, great practical applications, friendly. Would highly recommend for Physics at Bona's if you want to really LEARN Physics, rather than just get the A (but an A isn't too tough)
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	3	5	5	4	1622157	4/26/12	Tae is a really good professor. Seriously. He is super helpful and I feel like he is extremely skilled at expaining things. My favorite thing about him is that he works so hard at making sure that he improves to make your learning experience easier. I have been recommending him to anyone who has to take the class.
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	5	5	4	5	1622157	5/7/12	Very helpful and cared to the needs of the students. Hardest part about the class is doing all of the journals but gives you an opportunity to turn them in late. Literally impossible to fail because of how much extra credit and points there are. Tests are only work half of the course grade. Always open to any questions and helping students.
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	2	5	4	3	1622157	5/1/12	take home exams
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	2	Physics	104	3	5	5	4	1622157	4/26/12	Tae is a really good professor. He is very efficient with his explanations and incredibly organized. There are plenty of opportunities to reinforce things that are learned in class and he does his best to help. He gives surveys to try and improve his teaching style to try and make your learning experience easier.
St. Bonaventure University	Tae Cooke	4.1	0	Physics	103	3	1	1	1	1622157	1/7/12	He is hard to talk to and is seems to get upset when you as him a question. There is plenty of opportunities to do extra credit, which saves your grade.

Then, when going over the test, he explains that we must not have studied enough to not know how to solve a problem. Four hours of studying is still not enough.

However, I felt that even if I had put in more effort, I wouldn't have done much better. The graphs that he draws are very confusing, and half the time he barely even explains what the hell he means by certain things. Lots of irrelevant examples during lectures.

St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	2	Theology	101	3	3	5	2	353710	6/18/10	So she's not that bad of a teacher. I had her last semester. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE STORIES!! If you read the stories, and write the papers, you're gonna get an A. If ur like me and DONT read the stories, you'll get a B, my friend and I did. STAY AWAKE IN HER CLASS! DON'T SLEEP! That can hurt ur grade. And dont miss class. That hurts grades too
St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	2	Theology	101	2	2	5	5	353710	3/26/09	Really smart. Do the readings. Weekly 2 page papers. Add alot of personal stuff and you will get an A. Be active in class discussion.
St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	0	Theology	101	1	2	2	1	353710	11/4/07	If you can get out of taking her do it. Her material is based on how she precieves it and any other way is wrong. Very difficult grader where as the most perfect paper would get a maximum B. She says the first day that she designs her tests so u can not finish them and when u dont there is no curve. DO NOT TAKE HER! p.s she has pit stains eery day

St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	1	Theology	101	2	3	3	1	353710	1/5/05	She's insane. Way too hard for a freshman clare course. She made my mondays and wednesdays a struggle by contradicting what she says in one class with what she says in the next class. She forces her opinions on you and it's her way or no way. If you have to take her, take a lot of notes!
St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	2	Theology		2	4	4	2	353710	12/7/04	the class was pretty hard especially since there were quizzes every week. but she goes over everything pretty well and she was eager to help when i needed it. shes also very nice.

St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	0	Theology	401	1	1	1	3	353710	12/20/10	She is extremely hard. She gave me my worst grade that I ever got at the entire University, and I am a business major!! She was not willing to help and had comments that were subjective. Her entire grading policy was based on her own subjective views on our papers.
St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	1	Theology	101	2	3	3	1	353710	4/6/09	She is an insane lady, but you get used to it. The first class you take with her will be very hard, but by the middle of the semester, you can read her like a book. She is a crazy German, but she means well. Class is weekly work for a good grade
St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	2	Theology	101	3	5	4	4	353710	5/3/08	She is not a horrible professor like the previous person said..If you read a majority of the texts, write the papers, take a few notes, and talk during class (do the work) she loves you. She doesn't care if you're right or wrong, she'll help you understand in a way that doesn't make you feel dumb. One of my favorites for her humor and crazy tactics

St. Bonaventure University	Anne Foerst	2.8	2	Theology		3	5	5	5	353710	2/1/05	Foerst is amazing. Sometimes, however, she's so smart it hurts to be around her. You have to be willing to work, or you won't get anywhere. If you put the effort in, any of her theology classes are worth taking.

St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology	422	1	1	1	5	298044	3/27/06	Class is extremely and unnecessarily hard. Way to much work and effort is required, and despite your effort your grade is still bad! His class requirements are not clear nor are dates of tests and when assignements are due.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology	422	1	1	1	3	298044	3/27/06	Requirements unclear, extremely boring, makes it difficult to do well no matter haw hard you study
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	2	Psychology		4	4	4	2	298044	3/15/06	Gelfand is not a bad teacher. He tries to cover all that he can in the short amount of class time. He is very smart and helps when you go to him, although he takes 45 minutes to explain one concept. The class has so much work so keep up with everything and you will do fine.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology		3	1	2	2	298044	10/5/05	If I could take Stats with someone else, I would. This guy cannot teach and he's NO HELP!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	2	Psychology	201	3	4	3	5	298044	12/2/04	He's a great guy, even if his class is difficult. A lot of work, but you definitely learn a lot if you try.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology		2	1	1	NULL	298044	6/26/04	Not that anyone has a choice, but know what you're in for. If you need extra help, he'll help you, after complaining you should see his "assistants", and then putting up with his ego while he teaches you. No personality, No tact.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	2	Psychology	201	2	5	3	NULL	298044	11/30/03	Go easy on him. He's a great guy, it's just a tough class with so much to cover. I learned alot from him, and he's always there if you need extra help!
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	2	Psychology	202	2	5	3	5	298044	2/2/07	Dr. G is the man. I wish he wasn't retiring; he's the most intelligent man in De La Roche.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	1	Psychology		3	3	2	2	298044	3/28/06	Dr. G isn't as bad as people make him out to be--he expects a lot, but .. this IS college. As long as you do the work and stay on top of things, you'll be fine. Just don't procrastinate.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology	201	1	1	1	3	298044	3/27/06	hard grader and very unhelpful
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology		2	1	1	3	298044	3/25/06	worst teacher i've ever had...nice guy, awful teacher...i will never take again!
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	1	Psychology		3	3	2	2	298044	1/15/06	I've never met a teacher that talked slower than this man. Overall good guy, but definitely likes the sound of his own voice. I wouldn't take him again, but .. he's not the worst.
St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology	201	1	1	1	3	298044	3/15/05	I despise this man!! He has poor teaching skills. He is no help at all and should seek retirement SOON!!

St. Bonaventure University	Harold Gelfand	2.5	0	Psychology		1	1	1	NULL	298044	11/24/03	If there were ANY OTHER CHOICE, I would say NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS MAN!! But at Bona's as a psych major your stuck b/c he's the only one who teaches stats. Be prepared for TONS of work and very little clarity from Grimus. Yes, he wears purple. ;)
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Ghiloni	4.8	2	Theology	104	5	5	5	4	277528	10/28/07	Prof. Ghiloni is a great teacher. Very interesting and dynamic. He will really make you see the "other side" of the issues discussed in class. Just be prepared to take his class early in the morning and NEVER miss a class. Unfortunately Ghiloni is no longer with Bonaventure.
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Ghiloni	4.8	2	Theology	104	5	5	5	4	277528	10/5/05	Easiest teacher ever, very funny and nice...definitely take Peter's classes!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Ghiloni	4.8	2	Theology		5	4	4	NULL	277528	11/6/03	An overall nice guy. Lenient with grades. Not lenient with attendance policy. However, he is very nice and helpful.
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Ghiloni	4.8	2	Theology	204	5	5	5	5	277528	10/31/06	Great teacher, really fun class! He teaches at 8:30 but it's worth waking up for!
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Ghiloni	4.8	2	Theology	104	5	5	5	NULL	277528	12/5/03	One of the best professors I have ever had. He tries very hard to get students involved, but if you don't do the work, there's no penalty. VERY lenient with grades, but if you skip a class, you get 5 pts deducted from your final grade.
St. Bonaventure University	Benjamin Gross	4.2	1	Sociology	101	2	4	2	1	1665476	3/24/13	He takes everything out of the text book. But he might change his teaching style in the middle of the semester really close to finals too, so be prepared. Make sure that you do read the book. He is a good prof. and is willing to help you in office hours
St. Bonaventure University	Benjamin Gross	4.2	2	Sociology	101	4	5	4	4	1665476	9/26/12	Take good notes and use the study guides for the tests. Love the class!

St. Bonaventure University	 Elenchin	4.4	2	Sociology	320	4	5	5	5	970453	3/30/12	He is the best. Elenchin keeps the class very interesting, everyone is engaged. Just participate, everything that is on the notes is on the exam. Always be on his good side but its hard not to be. Cool guy, study well for exam and pay attention and you will pass. PS: Class will rarely get boring unless the topic is boring but not his fault.
St. Bonaventure University	 Elenchin	4.4	1	Sociology	400	3	3	3	2	970453	11/11/09	He tends to play favorites so of you are not on his good side do not expect him to be helpful.
St. Bonaventure University	 Elenchin	4.4	2	Sociology	105	3	5	4	3	970453	11/19/07	BEST SOC. PROFESSOR! NOT THE EASIEST GRADER THOUGH AND HIS TESTS CAN GET A LITTLE DIFFICULT, BUT HE'S A REALLY GOOD TEACHER. DEF. RECOMMEND HIM!!!
St. Bonaventure University	 Elenchin	4.4	2	Sociology	320	4	4	4	4	970453	3/20/10	Class is always interesting, and he hardly ever just lectures. He is a very understanding professor and his tests are not bad if you take notes and interact in class. If your an education major his class is a good choice for a social studies concentration.
St. Bonaventure University	 Elenchin	4.4	2	Sociology	101	3	5	5	3	970453	12/4/07	Dr. E is awesome. Pay attention in class and take good notes, do the readings and you will do good in his classes. Ask him for help if you're doing bad on exams and he'll give you good advice. I highly recommend him, he's a good person and great teacher. Very helpful.

St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Farrow	4.2	2	English	252	2	5	4	3	1043103	2/7/12	Dr. farrow is one of the best Professors I have ever had, and I come from a pretty good English Lit background for my B.A. If there was one bad thing, it is that he gets off on tangents, but they do come full circle, are relevant to coursework and almost always funny! A top-notch guy in ANYone's book, as far as I ma concerned
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Farrow	4.2	2	English	360	4	4	4	4	1043103	1/2/09	Dr. Farrow is the one of the most spirited and knowledgable professors in the English Department. The work he asks of you is reasonable and his lectures are very interesting if you enjoy literature. He is very willing to help if need be and is def. worth taking.
St. Bonaventure University	Anne-Claire Fisher	2.5	2	Education	511	3	4	4	3	1049177	8/14/08	Last year was her first year teaching, and I think that she will just get better from here. At first she didn't quite know how to structure the class, but her knowledge and interest in the subject was evident. She is a very nice woman, and she is very helpful if you ask her for it. I think that she will only improve from here.
St. Bonaventure University	Anne-Claire Fisher	2.5	0	Education	340	3	1	1	3	1049177	11/6/07	she is TERRIBLE!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	101	4	4	5	3	272749	11/13/12	He is really easy and it is hard to get a bad grade if you show up and participate. The entire class is pretty much discussion and he repeats himself a lot but you definitely get the idea. Not the most interesting professor but he is nice and the class is easy.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	101	4	4	5	2	272749	11/15/11	Prof. Fodor is the best! He may seem a little dry, but really kept conversation moving in class. He is very objective, and fair grader. Do the reading logs and you'll be fine! There is only 1 test (the final), and only 4 papers. Class participation is key.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	1	Theology	101	3	3	2	3	272749	12/14/06	Boring!
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	1	Theology	106	1	3	2	1	272749	11/14/05	Fodor is a very nice person in general, but the class is a bore and 6 page quizzes are HARD!!!!!!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	0	Theology		3	1	1	3	272749	6/3/05	He is not like will ferrell, because will ferrell is actually cool. Fodor is more of a hipocrite, he'll agree with what you say, and then change everything around. He also doesnt grade anything himself, prolly has the canadians do all his work. If you take him, maybe he'll tell you about his green card and how if he loses it he can be deported..
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	101	5	5	5	NULL	272749	10/31/03	Cool guy, tries to get the students involved but the Clare class is just boring. He does a good job, and he is canadian.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	101	4	4	5	2	272749	7/20/12	Prof. Fodor was always helpful, and really lets the students direct the discussion. He will help you out on complicated texts, but really challenges you to develop your own opinion. This class is boring, every section is, but his interest in the book will help you maintain interest.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	110	2	3	4	1	272749	6/22/09	Nice guy, but the class sucked.. you had two papper due every class..and forget about missing a class. You would have homework on top of the class disscussion paper you need to write about since you missed it..i'd take another teacher..p.s. those midterm and final paper he giver were the death of me...such a hard grader!
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	1	Theology	106	4	3	3	2	272749	3/15/06	He speaks pretty quietly so sit up front in order to hear anything. Then again the class is extremely boring, but not hard at all.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology	101	2	4	5	2	272749	8/31/05	Dr.Fodor is very punctual, and quite routine minded. He is very smart but I really didnt have any trouble getting a high grade in his class. The papers were a pain in the butt, other than that though- he isnt thattt bad.
St. Bonaventure University	Jim Fodor	3.5	2	Theology		5	3	4	NULL	272749	5/27/04	umm...sort of like the snl character where will farrell plays a keyboard and sings with his wife while preaching ...or something. "participate" and you will do well
St. Bonaventure University	Jason Fox	4.0	2	Music	101	4	4	4	4	1116520	4/2/08	Great Guy! He is very serious about his class. He likes to perfect the music as best he can and expects a bit out of students, especially the trumpets. If you want to take a class and get an A and $500 per semester, then join Concert Band!!
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	0	Philosophy	109	4	2	2	2	174438	12/12/09	Incredibly hypocritical. He's longwinded and can't keep your interest. Highly recommend avoiding at all costs as it is a complete waste of time.
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	108	3	5	4	2	174438	12/16/07	Excellent Prof. He is very clear and knows the material extremely well. He is very biased towards nonviolence but is still willing to hear your argument and present a counter argument in a professional way. Also, very interesting class, I learned a lot. Definitely recommend taking him.
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	203	3	5	5	4	174438	3/20/07	Great class, really good guy, I would take him any day.
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	174438	9/15/05	He practices what he preaches. and he makes tea in class. very endearing.

St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	1	Philosophy		3	4	1	2	174438	10/18/04	He is boring, and he sweats a lot. He doesn't take attendance though, which is one plus.

St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	101	4	4	5	NULL	174438	12/14/03	I disagree with him 80% of the time, but he's an honest man. He may be wrong, but I like him.

St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	0	Philosophy	108	5	2	2	2	174438	12/12/09	Hypocritical and narrow minded. He's dull, and boring with little to no knowledge of anything outside his narrow field. He doesn't support any viewpoint that isn't his own. His classes do not provoke you to think at all, instead it's a brainwashing exercise.
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	203	5	5	5	4	174438	10/22/07	A really good teacher! He knows what he is talking about and as long as you pay attention and do the small amount of work he gives you, you'll do great!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	0	Philosophy		5	1	1	1	174438	2/16/06	This guy's class is a joke. All you have to do is agree with him and he'll give you an A. I thought we were supposed to learn things in college. If you disagree, you might as well leave. He's pretty stuck on his non-violent views, so he backs out of any kind of conflict in the class.
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	108	5	5	5	5	174438	8/24/05	An amazing prof.!!!! Def take him- he is on sabbatical this year but yeah he is very smart and very helpful. Easy to talk to and helpful with work!!! Truly an amazing man!
St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy	108	5	5	5	3	174438	5/18/05	Perhaps the easiest course I've taken so far at St. Bonaventure. Only have to write three papers (about 250 words in length), and take a total of five quizzes (which are on the continents). As for teaching styles: I felt he varied his methods as much as he could have. There were times where we'd just watch a video or listen to a speaker.

St. Bonaventure University	Barry Gan	3.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	NULL	174438	12/8/03	I really enjoyed taking your class. And found the information enlightening and at the same time in search of new and different answers and questions.

She is unclear about the standards but goes on & on about stories that don't help anyone. This class was a severe insult to my intelligence & it inspired me to change majors. I'm so glad I did. Her approach to teaching is too simplified.
St. Bonaventure University	Rene Garrison	3.5	2	Education	440	3	5	5	4	1582282	12/13/11	I loved the class. She is very helpful and very nice. She knows the material and does well to convey meaningful information.

St. Bonaventure University	Ted Georgian	3.7	1	Biology	112	2	3	3	2	255069	5/18/09	DO NOT GET HIM! He gave me a D on a paper when he should have given me a A or B because he read too fast and did not catch my information. This just shows how much he really cares about his students. On top of that, he tests are hard and goes more indepth with his tests than he did in class when he says, " I only test on inclass notes."
St. Bonaventure University	Ted Georgian	3.7	2	Biology		2	5	4	NULL	255069	5/27/04	I found him to be a great professor, he was always willing to help and even did in class demonstrations to make sure that you understood.
St. Bonaventure University	Ted Georgian	3.7	2	Biology	200	2	5	5	NULL	255069	12/2/03	I had Dr. Georgian for numerous classes.

St. Bonaventure University	Jerry Godbout	2.8	1	Chemistry	101	2	4	2	4	767957	12/10/09	It's hard to understand exactly what objectives he's trying to teach. He's very generous in "mercy" points and you usually get a good grade if you participate, go to him with questions, and attend review sessions.
St. Bonaventure University	Jerry Godbout	2.8	2	Chemistry	102	2	5	4	4	767957	8/18/09	Godbout is an excellent prof, he's very organized, and always put the lecture notes online so you can go back and look at them after class when you're studying. You can always go to him with questions. One of his assistants holds a homework help session once a week, and he has a review session the day before every exam.
St. Bonaventure University	Jerry Godbout	2.8	0	Chemistry	102	1	1	1	4	767957	5/10/08	does not care about his students, breaks you up into groups and only lectures for 5 mins, tests are impossible, with a class average of 68 (that he thinks is great) he doesnt curve, not helpful at all, seriously avoid him if you can- makes it seem like he doesnt care about his students even if he does
St. Bonaventure University	Jerry Godbout	2.8	2	Chemistry	101	3	4	4	4	767957	11/15/07	He is a good teacher. You can go to his office and get help whenever you need it. You can re-take quizes to get better grades. In class he breaks you into groups and you just work on the notes together

St. Bonaventure University	Jerry Godbout	2.8	0	Chemistry	102	1	2	1	1	767957	12/17/07	I wouldnt take this man for Natty World. He is not familiar with the material, which made it very hard to understand what he was trying to teach. "Umm." and then quickly changing the slide on the powerpoint was his way of teaching.

When it comes to the subject material we should be learning, it doesnt really seem like a priority to him, but you're expected to know the textbook for the exams.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism		3	5	5	5	157316	5/22/06	Greatest professor Bonas has ever had. If you can't learn from this guy, you're an idiot.

Also, he gets off on tangents very easily. He's not afraid to have an in-class discussion about virtually anything. His teaching style is something truly worth witnessing.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism		3	5	5	5	157316	9/2/05	Hanchette is the best there has ever been. Simply put, he's the man. If you want to enjoy your class and actually learn while you do it, Hanchette's who you want. Without a doubt, my all-time favorite teacher / professor.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism		4	4	5	NULL	157316	5/11/04	What a fun guy! He has the most interesting stories - I think he knows something about everything.

St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism		3	5	3	NULL	157316	12/16/03	Great guy, knows/ had his hands in everything when it comes to the media. Great tangents, too. But the dreaded "Okay... let's go to the terminals," means websurfing for another half hour. That needs to be worked on a bit ;) I love him, you will
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism	201	4	4	4	4	157316	3/25/10	He is so renowned and accomplished, but still so cool and down 2 earth. classes were fun, he loves telling stories and his halarious.

St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism	202	4	5	5	5	157316	3/29/09	Really interesting guy. He's the biggest success this school has in the field of journalism in my opinion. A Pullitzer Prize winner, Editor of prestigious papers such as Gannette. He has the best stories, and he's a bright guy. He motivates you to take an interest in current news events and is more than willing to hear your opinion on them.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism		4	4	4	5	157316	10/23/07	THE MAN! Stories he tells are awesome. The guy is awesome (besides being a red sox fan). He is a great guy though, and his class focuses 1/2 on curriculum and 1/2 on his stories/experiences. He is the best.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism	101	3	5	5	5	157316	11/16/06	Hanchette rules! Finally a professor who you don't feel like you have to laugh at to make him feel better. You laugh because he is legitimately very funny. His class was my favorite

St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism	203	3	4	4	4	157316	5/29/05	Don't buy the book and expect to really study it. The true wisdom from this class is when you listen to his real-life stories (founding editor of USA Today)and the relationships he has forged in the business (ranked among top 25 journalists of our time by Gannett News Services). I didn't get the easy A I expected, but I'll take a B- w/ him anyday.
St. Bonaventure University	John Hanchette	4.4	2	Journalism	201	3	5	4	NULL	157316	4/22/04	I love this man. I have learned so much from him in this class! He creates excitment about journalism which is one of his best qualities. His stories will have you laughing but they serve a purpose.

St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	3	1	1	5	1046090	12/3/11	only one word to describe her personality...retarded. bitter about being horrendous looking. completely unprofessional. rac ist. flirts with all the guys (20 yrs younger than her.. ew.) doesn't know the material she has to teach and her essay grading is completely nonsensical except that she plays favorites. don't take her.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	399	3	2	2	3	1046090	12/24/10	helpful when trying to figure out techniques used in articles. however, does not give back grades in time to make up for bad ones. helps to prep for senior sem but totally unfair in grading
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	1	1	4	1046090	11/22/10	Im embarrassed that she is my professor. Last year some people put together a petition to say how bad of a teacher she is. She is extra nice now because she knows that people hate her and she actually even grades easier. It is possible to get a good grade in her class if she likes you, but this grade will have nothing to do with your ability.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	2	1	1	5	1046090	12/27/09	office hours seriously nonexistent and even when you make appointments she'll either 1) be in her lab without you knowing and then will make you wait 15 minutes after your meeting time or 2) never show up. never e-mails students back. does not know material. cannot explain material in an understandable manner
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	2	1	4	1046090	11/2/09	I am currently taking Genetics w/Dr. Hens. To put it simple, I find her sense of humor to be great, and she is even sweet at times. However, what is most important, her teaching skills, is lacking severly. She does not know what she is even teaching about the majority of the time and that makes it almost impossible for her to be anybit helpful.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology		1	1	1	3	1046090	2/18/09	Horrible Professor. Good luck with her for Natural World Lab. Let's just say other students with other professors with the EXACT comparable work would do SIGNIFICANTLY better. 45-50% was an average grade on labs that you bust your butt on. Unfair and doesn't explain at all.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	201	1	2	1	3	1046090	11/9/08	By far the worst teacher to grace the biology department. She let's her emotions take over the logic of the class. If you don't like her she will keep a strong grudge against you. She only knows material pertaining to her research and very little about other subjects. She places an extreme amounts of favoritism in the class of students over others.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	2	Biology	291	2	5	4	4	1046090	4/21/08	Hard, but fair. You work your ass.. you get a chance at the A. Many students thought they would get an easy A.. they were wrong.. Kind of cute
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	2	Biology		2	4	4	4	1046090	12/20/07	Actually I disagree, she is a good person, and a great teacher.....too bad most people dont bust their ass to get a good grade....because she will give it to you if you actually TRY.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology		1	1	1	4	1046090	10/31/07	Shes not nice at all and she is a terrible teacher. Just because you have your PHD doesnt mean you can teach.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	1	1	1	1046090	10/31/11	The worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. She almost enjoys making people's lives miserable, probably cuz of some trauma she had with a bad teacher. Grades unfairly and inconsistently and will pull some make-believe fact out of her ass to shut the student up. Quitefull of herself and has no idea what it means to be a professor or aperson
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	1	1	3	1046090	11/22/10	I agree with every negative comment below. I think that she may have even written the positive ones. They sound exactly how she describes herself as everyone else rolls their eyes. She is by far the dullest tool in the shed.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	1	Biology	362	2	2	3	4	1046090	3/26/10	She basically runs the Biology Dept. here. She teaches a lot of classes which is part of her downfall, but she is a really good person and as a bio student here it is extremely important that your on her good side.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	1	1	2	1046090	12/13/09	DONT TAKE HER. Its simple, shes a horrible professor, she may be nice to you outside of class if she likes you. She is very biased in her grading and does not know the material well. She is more a lab tech.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	291	1	1	1	1	1046090	11/2/09	When I think of Dr. Hens I become sad. Going to her class would frequently ruin my day. It was like being backhanded for 50 minutes. She has almost no understanding of genetics, or how to teach. Her tests primarily tested my ability to fill in bubbles quickly. She is the WORST faculty member on campus. TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE (or god have mercy)
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology		2	2	2	4	1046090	11/12/08	Anyone considering this professor should also look at her ratings at University of Maryland, University college. The bad ratings are NOT an anomaly.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology	202	1	1	1	3	1046090	9/9/08	First of all, she doesn't know biology that well. She spent most of her life as a low entry lab tech and got lucky to land a job at St. Bonaventure. It shows because she clearly does not have a clue of basic genetic material, yet she grills the students unfairly on lab techniques. Hands down the worst professor in St. Bonanventure.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	2	Biology	201	2	3	4	4	1046090	2/7/08	Kinda unclear...just needs time to adjust...and maybe look over her own genetics 101 notes.
St. Bonaventure University	J. Hens	1.7	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	1046090	12/18/07	As a St. Bonaventure student that took her class fall 2007, I can guarantee you that s he is the worst professor on campus. The sheer fact the she is working at bonaventure is a disgrace to the faculty. Very stubborn, will grade solely on favoritism, and does not know her subject well.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	301	2	5	5	5	1332460	1/29/13	AWESOME GUY! If he could teach every class I took at Bonas I would take him every time. Keeps you interested in the subject matter. However, if you don't go to class and don't study on a frequent basis you will probably not do very well. He will help you if you ask for it, I recommend it actually.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	301	2	2	5	5	1332460	11/14/11	One of the best, if not best teachers at Bonas. HOWEVER, you have to listen in lecture and be inherently smart, because he will never tell you an answer, he makes you get to it yourself. and if you cant get to it yourself, you're SOL because he won't help you save for a few hints. moves fast, won't go at your slow pace. makes it tense.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	302	5	2	5	5	1332460	5/15/10	Easy lab. Usually get out early and he is extremely helpful.

St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	301	1	5	5	3	1332460	12/13/09	Nice guy, tests are really hard, but if you study the curve is good. Be prepared to STUDY the hardest you ever have for any course. There is a lot of material.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	301	4	5	5	4	1332460	10/18/12	He is a great teacher. The course is very challenging and he goes fast through lecture but if you read the text book and go to him for help, he is so helpful and you should do good. His exams are very difficult but if you go to him and study hard, meaning every single day, then you should be good.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	302	2	4	4	2	1332460	6/15/10	overall a pretty good professor. no one will ever figure out how his bellcurve works... but i'd recommend taking him either way
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	302	1	3	5	5	1332460	5/15/10	He is the man. His class is really hard but if you show effort he gives you a good grade. Exams are really tough but the curve is huge. Easily get a B- with effort.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	301	1	4	5	5	1332460	12/27/09	Very fun and interesting teaching. Has temper tantrums many a time, but he's so cool and a great teacher. More than willing to meet during office hours.
St. Bonaventure University	David Hilmey	4.4	2	Chemistry	201	3	5	5	5	1332460	10/26/09	LOVE this guy. he loves organic chemistry and it's pretty funny. He's very exciting to listen to and it's easy to understand him. it's just an extremely hard and tedious course but he RULES

St. Bonaventure University	Joel Horowitz	3.7	0	History	309	1	1	2	2	8312	3/28/08	Wayyyy overrated as a Prof. Has clear favorites, and if you're not one of them then good luck trying to get him to even talk to you.

St. Bonaventure University	Joel Horowitz	3.7	2	History		5	5	5	1	8312	8/24/05	This class was a joke... I went to it 3 times: first day, mid-term, and final, and pulled a B. He was soooo easy.

St. Bonaventure University	Christine Hunt	2.1	0	Education	101	5	1	1	1	1098655	3/24/13	Though you do not need this class she did help. As a teacher I would not take her again if I can try, but changes are going to have to. She treates you like you are her 3rd grade class, so do not pop gum. When she gives directions they are really confusing so make sure you read them really slow, and chop it up
St. Bonaventure University	Christine Hunt	2.1	2	Education	240	3	4	3	3	1098655	10/23/08	She is a nice lady. At first I thought about changing my major too but if you get on her good side you will do well! Act like you care in her class, participant, do the assignments and you will get an A.She does talk to you like you are four but you will get used to it.
St. Bonaventure University	Christine Hunt	2.1	0	Education	240	4	1	2	1	1098655	1/28/08	I hated her. She talks to her students like they are four, granted she is a Early Childhood teacher she is a horrible college professor. She made me want to change my major because she was so such a horrible teacher. if possible take ECED with someone else Not helpful at all
St. Bonaventure University	Christine Hunt	2.1	1	Education	240	4	3	3	3	1098655	11/16/10	I hate this class. She does talk to you like you are a child and she is extremely annoying. The field work is a joke and she has you do two projects at the same time! It's far too much work to do for an early childhood class. Her quizzes are easy. she is extremely unfair in her assignments. The class is easy though if you do your work. Its tedious.

St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	740	2	5	4	4	1516109	9/25/12	Shelley is excited about the topic, the field and her students. She engages, gently reaches for more and brings a nice energy to the room. Strongly recommended, extremely well prepared and knows her material.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism		3	4	3	4	1516109	9/24/12	Shelley is not knowledgeable and kind! I found her to be very sweet and engaging. She knows her stuff! :)
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	560	3	5	4	5	1516109	5/8/12	Four words: Shelley knows her stuff! Her best attribute may be that she challenges every student to push one step further. For this class, New Media, Shelley challenged people with an incredible online presence as well as someone without any. Some portions were a bit rushed (only a 5-week class), but learned a comprehensive view on New Media.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	600	3	5	4	5	1516109	5/8/12	Shelley was my advisor during a portion of my undergrad, and I was excited when I found out she was teaching an IMC class. Shelley is great. Yeah, she's demanding. But she demands your best work. And if you don't want to produce the best work possible, then why are you in school? Also, total babe.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	600	3	4	3	4	1516109	5/8/12	Shelley is demanding. She may be the most demanding professor in IMC history. Shelley's tough, but extremely fair. She won't BS you ever. For IMC students, you didn't have a choice but to take her. Undergrads do. But the professor knows her stuff. Seriously. She's really knowledgable about what she teaches. But she demands professionalism.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	600	1	5	5	3	1516109	2/20/12	Shelley is intimidating in the classroom but in the end she knows what she is talking about and is very helpful with any questions you have.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	600	3	3	4	3	1516109	2/19/12	Great professor.Expects a lot from students and there is a big workload, but all comes full circle when you walk away having learned a lot.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	1	Journalism	203	2	2	3	3	1516109	12/21/10	Extremely rude. Is very knowledgeable with content, however, she nit-picks incessantly and you will dread going to each class.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	740	3	5	4	4	1516109	9/25/12	Shelley is very knowledgeable in the PR field and it shows. She is great at engaging students and asking for feedback. If you ever have questions for Shelley she will do the best she can to help and she even considers how we learn when she teaches the class. I especially liked the fun review games we played! I would highly recommend! :)
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	560	2	5	4	5	1516109	5/15/12	Excellent prof! Detailed, demanding, and fair. She'll draw out your best work and encourage you to be even better. The great part is, with her instruction, you can be.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	560	2	5	5	5	1516109	5/8/12	One of the most knowledgeable professors I've ever had. Brings a lot of energy to the classroom and truly makes her students want to be there. Take her classes as often as you can...it will be both enjoyable and worth it for your education!
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	560	2	4	5	5	1516109	5/8/12	Highly recommend her if you want to learn a lot. Shelley has softened up a lot since I first had her. (Thanks, Nigel!) She does not accept BS and sees right through it if you try. She knows her stuff and doesn't have a problem questioning you. She has high standards for herself & her students. Her classes are always worthwhile.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	375	1	5	5	5	1516109	5/2/12	Shelly is AWESOME. Best professor I've ever had through out my entire education! She expects a lot, but it is entirely worth it because you learn more than you can ever imagine. She is very knowledgeable of what she teaches and truly cares about her students. MAKE SURE to take shelly before you graduate!
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	600	1	5	5	4	1516109	2/20/12	Shelley was a well-knowledgeable professor who truly cared about how and what she taught. She was able to relate it to the the real world which was helpful.
St. Bonaventure University	Shelley Jack Follow shebejack	4.3	2	Journalism	700	1	5	5	5	1516109	2/19/12	Shelley is an engaging, intelligent and tech-savvy teacher that knows just the right buttons to push for her students to achieve their potential. Although she may come off as demanding, I see it as "tough love." As an graduate student who has gone through the IMC program with Shelley, I can honestly say that her teaching style works and w

St. Bonaventure University	David Haack	4.2	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	5	604475	4/25/05	His class is really interesting. He knows his stuff. But he is kind of monotone and a little weird, but I really enjoy art so it was a good class.
St. Bonaventure University	David Haack	4.2	2	Fine Arts	109	4	5	5	4	604475	10/14/10	Very passionate about what he teaches. If you have any interest in Art at all, definitely take his class. Favorite CLAR course by far

St. Bonaventure University	David Haack	4.2	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	604475	11/4/05	Brother David is great, his classes maynot be the easiest, or the most interesting subject matter, but I definatly feel that i've learned a lot from him.
St. Bonaventure University	David Haack	4.2	1	Fine Arts	109	4	3	3	2	604475	5/29/05	This class is a waste of your time. But take it anyways. Befriend Bro. David. He is a genius when it comes to art (he was the source of the Rembrandt scandal a few years ago), and is revered among his fellow friars. Prepare to fall asleep a few times and learn next to nothing, but realize that college is more than just textbook learning.

St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	209	5	4	4	3	1116728	12/18/12	Had him for Literature and Art. He said it was his first time teaching the course. He kept it really interesting, and we never had much work to do. Had a powerpoint presentation which was a cinch, a research paper, and took a few notes on moodle. Read the book so he doesn't get mad. Easy A.
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	376	4	4	4	4	1116728	12/7/11	Good in general. Sometimes he seemed kinda boastful. The reading material was nice but excessive to make the most of it in a semester
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	0	English	110	4	1	3	4	1116728	12/16/08	I got a lower grade due to him holding all my essays til the last day of class. I lost points for the same reason on every paper and was unknowing to this because I never saw them. Besides that its basically a lot of papers with pretty easy tests.
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	221	4	5	4	3	1116728	4/2/08	Excellent teacher. Very willing to help his students and has a very good disposition. He works hard to help students relate to the subject. Also... not so bad to look at.
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	365	5	4	3	4	1116728	4/3/12	Very attractive-sort of a hipster yuppie though, but generally nice overall. Not into the modern poetry myself-but he made it somewhat bearable. Senior English comp. on 20th American Lit. w/ him wasn't too bad either (luckily for me 'cause i didn't read much of it). Tests were straight forward, paper grading was mostly fair too. I'd recommend him.
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	220	3	4	5	3	1116728	11/2/09	Good nice professor. he can make jokes and relate to younger kids.
St. Bonaventure University	Kaplan Harris	3.9	2	English	220	2	5	5	4	1116728	12/14/08	He is a great teacher. He has passion for what he does and it rubs off on his students. Very inspiring. Probably my fav. And its true.. he's not bad to look at. :)
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	122	2	5	5	3	581664	10/24/12	great guy, tells you exactly what is on the tests. What he does in class is exactly what is on his tests.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	152	4	5	5	3	581664	1/17/11	Very dedicated to his work. He stayed with me for an hour his office hours ended once.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1	581664	10/6/10	Hes an absolute AWFUL!! teacher. He is one of the most creepy guys I've ever meet. His tests are ridiculous, he never helps when you ask he always tells you to look back in your notes. DO NOT TAKE HIM!! if you have the choice, he looks and acts like a cereal killer.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	152	3	5	5	5	581664	12/13/09	Great guy. Class is a lot of work, weekly homework. Tests are not bad. If you work hard and go see him, you will get a good grade. Tests are only five pages long and 10 probs. Very nice, helpful
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	3	4	5	1	581664	9/27/09	He's a brilliant guy, too smart to be teaching at Bonas if you ask me. But he goes through everything you need to go in detail and makes sure that everyone is on board with the material. Good with names, very very fair grader.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	0	Mathematics	122	1	1	2	2	581664	12/3/08	Worst teacher ever. Hard tests, teaches by the book, weirdest man ive ever met. watch the movie stanger then fiction and thats him.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics	122	2	3	3	1	581664	7/22/07	His tests are really hard. Has a policy that if your final exam grade is better than your test average it will replace all your test grades but the final was impossible. Don't take him.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	2	4	4	1	581664	3/24/07	Well...he goes very slow...but his tests are REALLY hard

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	4	5	5	3	581664	1/15/11	He's so nice if you show you care. I got on his good side for his class (showed up to class) and I got an A- in it he's such a good teacher if you just pay attention. Dr. Chill is definitely one of my favorite teachers at Bonas
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	152	3	5	4	3	581664	1/4/10	Great teacher. Is willing to help with all homework and test preparation. You can tell he loves what he does. He even has sunday office hours!

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	2	4	3	3	581664	6/26/09	He's funny, a little unfair, and a true perfectionist. He will teach you the material, you might not like his way, but you will learn in. I didn't get an A, but I learned a lot of new stuff, which I'm thankful for. Take him, and don't slack off, he really dedicates all his time in teaching you. He even has Sunday office hours. Great Guy.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	121	5	5	5	2	581664	11/13/08	teaches with step by step instructions
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	207	4	5	4	2	581664	7/19/07	I'm not really sure why others have rated Hill so low. He explains concepts slowly, trying his best to make sure everyone understands. He is also a very fair grader when it comes to tests. Do the hw and take advantage of his office hours. You'll get at least a B.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	0	Mathematics	122	1	1	1	1	581664	4/3/06	wow..quite possibly the worst i've had here at bonas. he doesnt know how to relate to students, doesnt slow down and believes everyone knows what he is talking about the first time. DO NOT TAKE HIM..run from him..

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	207	3	5	5	5	581664	5/18/05	People say he's a hard grader, but personally I thought he was very fair. Lots of times he would give me points for things I honestly didn't even believe I deserved credit for. Very helpful and clear in his teaching. Made a class that could have been impossible into one that was merely challenging. He has a passion for mathematics and it shows.

St. Bonaventure University	Pauline Hoffmann	4.3	2	Journalism		3	4	4	4	1058508	3/10/09	She's a great lady- super nice. The only problem I have with her classes is that she teaches them like they're a joke, but then gives really hard tests. You don't expect them to be hard because the rest of the class is so easy. And she doesn't warn you.. so you kind of get blindsided by how hard the tests can be.

St. Bonaventure University	Mark Huddle	4.8	2	History	201	2	4	4	4	595967	11/30/06	He makes just as many jokes as he talks about history. The work load is tough.. a lot of reading; however, you learn a lot. He is a bit harsh on grading papers, but you learn better writing techniques.

St. Bonaventure University	MW Jackson	4.0	0	English	501	2	1	2	3	232016	11/30/09	He has a great sense of humor, but he's off topic for 1/2 of every class. If you don't understand the reading, you have to push him to clarify, otherwise he might not get to it. Very unclear expectations for graded assignments. He's biased toward certain theories over others, so you might have to learn the ones you're interested in on your own.
St. Bonaventure University	MW Jackson	4.0	2	English		3	3	4	4	232016	12/28/06	He's an awesome professor. Be prepared to laugh a lot in class. He's a tough grader though, and not always clear on what he wants from you in assignments and exams. Also, he only has five or so grades, so each one is heavily weighted. Reading is not at all necessary, as long as you skim and take good notes and pay attention in class.

Just a hoop to jump over, with respect to his classes, really not too much to learn - as he sucks at his job.

St. Bonaventure University	Matt King	1.5	0	Philosophy	110	3	2	2	3	1698549	2/19/13	His class was so easy. All you have to do is the writing assignments, and the reasings for them. If anything people should be able to pass with a A-. He really does help with your writing, and makes it better.
St. Bonaventure University	Matt King	1.5	0	Philosophy	111	3	1	1	2	1698549	3/7/12	spends most of class referencing only one student. all class examples refer to edna the sheep and aliens. he is never clear with assignments or lecture notes. didn't post midterm grades. However, he cancelled any homework for the semester because he didn't feel like grading it. I would not recommend him to anyone or take another of his classes.
St. Bonaventure University	Romy Knittel	4.5	2	Biology	105	2	5	5	4	493683	1/11/13	Tough but fair. Always there for you. Clear almost to a fault, as the eyes of students with short attention spans may glaze over during her thorough answers to their questions. Still great and very helpful overall. Be sure to read the lab manual!
St. Bonaventure University	Romy Knittel	4.5	2	Biology	106	2	5	4	5	493683	5/27/11	Romy will tell you how it is; she knows she can be moody sometimes, and doesnt like stupid questions, but she is one of the best profs there.

She does however, explain everything that students need to do to earn a good grade. She is also very helpful. She will definitely teach you the laboratory skills that are needed to succeed in college

St. Bonaventure University	Romy Knittel	4.5	2	Biology		2	4	4	5	493683	11/10/04	An overall nice lady, but grades really hard. Talks way too much, so don't ever count on getting out of class early... or on time. She's waaay to excited about what she does
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science	356	5	5	5	5	175093	6/19/12	She is beautiful and intellegent
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science	356	5	5	5	4	175093	4/3/12	POL 356= US & Latin American relations...EASY!! By mid semester I realized I only had to read to skim for answers for our on-line quizes (which I also googled the answers for too). Not a bad class if you don't have the time to read much oustide of class. Tests were straight forward and fair. I'd recommend her again. boring at times, but very sweet
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science	101	4	5	4	2	175093	7/28/11	Prof. Kubal is a good, helpful professor. Yeah, her classes can be pretty boring at times, and sometimes you might have to drag yourself out of bed, but at the end its worth it. I didn't go to class much, but when I did I made sure to take good notes. Exams are from her scattered notes.If you feel lost, go to her office hours, it got me an A!
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	0	Political Science	204	3	3	1	1	175093	12/12/09	I took her for both Women in Politics and Comparative Politics. It was a fight to get out of bed in the morning to drag myself into the class. I've never heard someone say "Um...right?" so many times. Avoid her unless you want an hour and fifteen minute period for making to-do lists, doodling and writing letters. I seriously have learned nothing.
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science		5	5	4	1	175093	12/15/05	Very smart and knowledgable lady. She might not be the best lecturer but she does her best and is very helpful if you ever ask her a question. Her exams are not that hard if you go to class and read.
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science	204	4	5	5	5	175093	10/14/05	Boring sometimes but very nice. IF you actually pay attention what she says is sometimes interesting.

St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	1	Political Science	101	5	3	2	1	175093	11/9/11	I'm impressed that she can talk for an hour and 15 minutes, but seriously I fall asleep during every class. She always asks for opinions, but no one ever answers so she just restates what she's already said. She doesn't teach, everything is just from online articles you have to read. Tests are all vocab. Easy, but so painful to sit through.
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	1	Political Science	101	3	4	2	4	175093	4/11/11	A huhuhuhuhuh. Kubal's life. Shes kinda boring like a shoe, but she has a funny laugh and can actually talk for an hour and fifteen minutes. HAve fun.
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science		4	5	5	3	175093	8/5/07	I want to thank Prof. Kubal. If you go to your classes and pay attention you will do fine, just take good notes, and to be honest i didnt do any of the readings. In the end, when it really mattered i took a summer class, and Kubal really helped me out, and although i never really thanked her, i would really like to say thankyou for her helpfulness
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science		4	4	3	1	175093	11/10/05	Count how many times she says UH, UHM, RIGHT? and ESSENTIALLY. SOOO boring, the only way I got through class was to talley the ammount of times she said those four words. It is amazing to me that a person could use these words so many times..
St. Bonaventure University	Mary Rose Kubal	3.8	2	Political Science		5	4	4	3	175093	11/13/04	she is a very nice and helpful teacher. her class can be boring but sometimes interesting

St. Bonaventure University	J Joyce	3.8	1	Sociology	101	5	3	2	2	732229	4/1/06	It's an easy enough class, but that's mainly because the material she's going over is stuff I have already learned in other classes. She has a habit of mumbling at times, and half the time there are side conversations going on in her class, which makes it all that harder to hear. Really disorganized. She's a nice enough lady though.
St. Bonaventure University	J Joyce	3.8	2	Sociology	108	4	4	3	2	732229	3/25/06	Dr. Joyce is awesome...she's so laid-back and really looks out for the students' interests. Not very hard, just do the readings and you'll be set. VERY nice prof!

St. Bonaventure University	J Joyce	3.8	2	Sociology	101	4	5	5	4	732229	10/20/05	Awesome professor! motherly type, very nice, and cares very much about her students. She is a fair grader and tells you in advance what you will be doing in class and what she expects. Her lectures are interesting and she explains the readings to you through her lectures. I highly recommend her :)

St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	0	Marketing	405	3	1	2	3	193969	12/9/12	Majority of what she talks about in class is useless and not on the test. If you read the book and know an example for EVERYTHING you will be fine. Not helpful at all when you ask. Means well.
St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	1	Marketing	698	3	3	3	3	193969	1/12/09	C.B. - Sometimes she was hard to undertand. The exams were difficult. I thought the class was incredibly boring and dull but that may just be my opinion. She was all over the place at times. The magazine advertisements were not large enough to see by holding them up. She did get points across clearly though.
St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	2	Marketing		3	5	4	4	193969	8/24/05	Dr. Khairullah ROCKED... I really liked my time with her. Advice: get to know her. Visit her in her office and show you're interested, and she will show you so much mercy. Once you're a favorite, it's an easy A.
St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	2	Marketing		5	5	4	NULL	193969	5/1/04	She is a great teacher, pretty nice and always fair and loves magazine ads...best part of the class was when she had some int'l guys talk of their experience
St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	0	Marketing		1	1	1	NULL	193969	4/22/03	Well, don't expect to be taught. She is quite scary when pronouncing certain words. And, she has a fetish for McDonald's and Jared from Subway. Tests are incredibly hard and unfair considering she does not teach.
St. Bonaventure University	Darriya Khairullah	2.9	1	Marketing		3	3	2	2	193969	1/13/10	"Are you folks with me or not" be ready to hear that statement over and over. Nice lady just difficult to understand. Dont miss the videos in class, they will be on the test in short answers

St. Bonaventure University	Darwin King	4.4	2	Accounting		3	5	5	3	172822	2/16/06	Darwin is one of the nicest people around. He's really into his field, and he loves helping students who have a hard time understanding. He uses a lot of ads and likes current topics. It isn't the most interesting material, but he brings it accrossed in an interesting way.
St. Bonaventure University	Darwin King	4.4	2	Accounting		4	4	4	3	172822	8/22/05	great teacher...take notes when he repeats things a lot of times
St. Bonaventure University	Darwin King	4.4	2	Accounting		3	5	5	3	172822	12/1/04	Awesome person willing to help you with ANYTHING!! Taught in a very clear format that a non-business major could understand. Always told goofy jokes at the end of class. One of the best profs here. Took ACCT 202 just because of his teaching!
St. Bonaventure University	Darwin King	4.4	2	Accounting	202	4	5	5	NULL	172822	12/27/03	Darwin is KING. Should over power anyone else in the department. He's down to earth and he loves his end-of-the-class-get-the-F-out-of-here jokes. Thanks DK

St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	2	1117906	11/7/12	I learned very little, if anything at all. The quizzes and tests weren't on material covered in class and were extremely difficult. Do not take this professor. You will hate math after having him.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	121	1	2	1	2	1117906	10/20/10	Uses wayyy to much sarcasm and makes simple concepts too complicated. One time I went to his office hours and he told me he couldn't help me until i was spending at least 2 hours a day teaching myself to understand the material. I always had either A's or B's in math until this class.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	1	1117906	4/27/10	DO NOT TAKE HIM..HIS VERY CONFUSING!!!! BAD TEACHER
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	1	Mathematics	121	2	3	3	4	1117906	12/21/09	Seems to be a hard teacher, but if you get to know him and go to his office hours, he can be very nice and helpful!!! Somewhat good sense of humor. Don't judge him until you get to know him!
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	121	2	2	2	2	1117906	10/26/09	Hands down the worst professor I've ever had in any class in my entire academic career. Absolutely awful teaching style (I use the term "teaching" very loosely). Answers questions with other questions. Direct quote: "You don't have to learn anything in here, I don't care. I'm only here for a paycheck." And he wonders why 90% of students fail.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	145	1	1	1	1	1117906	1/16/09	This was the worst class i have ever taken he makes you teach yourself and doesnt want to help you he makes the simplest things confusing and makes you feel stupid if you ask him to help you
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	145	1	1	1	4	1117906	12/4/08	WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! HE MAKES EVERYTHING WAY TO HARD AND CALLS PEOPLE STUPID AND THAT THEY WILL NEVER SUCCEED IN THEIR MAJOR. HE DOES NOT TEACH ANYTHING, HE LEAVES IT UP TO YOU TO TEACH YOURSELF AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT HE TELLS YOU THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN BETTER AND KNOW HOW TO TEACH YOURSELF.MAKES QUESTIONS WAY TO HARD
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	151	3	1	1	4	1117906	4/4/08	Absolutely useless. He refused to help or let me have a tutor. He told me to think about the problem for at least 15 minutes before I even tried the problem and then assumed I would get it. He would not tell me how to do the problem!
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	2	1117906	10/4/12	Worst teacher Ive ever had. Makes no sense at all and purposely makes concepts over complicated. Went to office hours multiple times and it didn't help. He openly puts down other professors who teach in a logical manner and condescends and mocks students who don't understand the material. Made my stressful freshman 1st semester even worse.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	2	Mathematics	121	1	5	3	4	1117906	8/19/10	He is hard teacher, you will learn a lot though if you put the work in, and if you work hard show him you doing his work he will give you a deceit grade
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	108	2	1	1	1	1117906	2/11/10	Horrible teacher! Confuses you more than what you are already are. Avoid having this teacher.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	2	1117906	10/28/09	The worst prof. to ever have
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	0	Mathematics	145	1	1	1	2	1117906	4/7/09	Horrible teacher. Makes you teach yourself and makes you feel dumb if you ask any questions. I dreaded this class
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	2	Mathematics	207	4	4	4	5	1117906	12/4/08	Makes you teach yourself. Class can be difficult if you don't put in the time, but if you do you will learn a lot about the subject he's teaching you, you will be a much better problem solver, and be better and teaching yourself and learning.
St. Bonaventure University	Michael Klucznik	1.8	1	Mathematics	151	1	4	2	2	1117906	4/26/08	RIDICULOUS!!! Makes simple concepts way too hard just to confuse everyone. Has favorites and lets everyone else know about it. Not only does he talk during surprise 2 question quizzes, when you turn in your quiz he will tell you in front of everyone if you got a certain answer right or wrong. Quizzes are over material never coverd and very difficul
St. Bonaventure University	Rick Knott	5.0	2	Education		4	5	5	5	610047	9/20/05	I thought Dr. Knott was great. he did alot to help me out and was very tolerent and supportive in the field based work
St. Bonaventure University	Rick Knott	5.0	2	Education		2	5	5	5	610047	5/2/05	I had a problem with Dr. Knott early on, but we were able to figure out the issue, and move on. I am happy to say that with Dr. Knott's help and assistance, I graduated!

St. Bonaventure University	George Lapennas	2.5	2	Biology	371	2	4	3	3	12321	1/22/05	His tests are much harder than what you are used to in Bio 105-6 and Genetics, but the best part about Lapennas, and what makes him an ok teacher is that he is more than willing to try and help you understand something... He wants you to do well but you just have to come to him first! Make sure to

St. Bonaventure University	George Lapennas	2.5	0	Biology	102	2	2	2	2	12321	12/21/07	very intelligent!! But trys to do to much in a class. Also HORRIBLE about getting papers, grades, tests etc back. I still don't have a final grade in his class even though they were due a week ago and I got all my other grades 5 days ago. Try to get Miller, Lapennas is a backup
St. Bonaventure University	George Lapennas	2.5	0	Biology	371	2	2	2	2	12321	8/24/05	really cool guy but not a very good teacher
St. Bonaventure University	George Lapennas	2.5	1	Biology	102	2	2	3	NULL	12321	12/19/03	He was amusing and somewhat interesting...but his grading was so freaky that no one got an A on tests (you have to repeat verbatim from the book). He also didn't turn tests back in for weeks.
St. Bonaventure University	George Lapennas	2.5	0	Biology	102	1	1	1	NULL	12321	4/3/03	He needs to take a few education courses! (He prepares a 90-slide presentation for a 50 min class)

St. Bonaventure University	Diana Lawrence-Brown	4.5	2	Education	503	2	5	3	2	1582283	2/19/13	Pretty good professor for the most part, although sometimes it was unclear what she wanted. This class is very difficult.
St. Bonaventure University	Diana Lawrence-Brown	4.5	2	Education	450	4	5	5	4	1582283	8/25/12	After two years of teaching, I can say that Dr. L-B's class was the most meaningful and useful in life beyond the "Bona Bubble." Her lessons and assignments are well-structured and realistic. If you are a general education teacher or special educator, you will need the skills in this class. Don't throw away the resources from this class.
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	0	Mathematics	251	1	3	1	1	1397375	1/29/13	Obsessed with stupid story telling, talks about every author as if they are his best friend. Most used quote, "remains to be seen." But I will say, if you seek help he will help you but be prepared for nonsensical story telling. His tests are sooo hard that you would think you were putting the rover on mars...
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	2	4	1397375	12/22/10	Is pretty hard to learn from in class and answers most questions with "read the book." If you ask a question he will laugh loudly before answering it. Homework will be on the test. He is willing to go out of his way to make sure you understand the material, but he's a better teacher one-on-one at office hours
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	1	Mathematics	208	3	5	1	3	1397375	5/15/10	He is really nice but class is horrible. You dont learn anything but he gives you a good grade if you try. Easy to talk to.
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	0	Mathematics	151	1	1	1	4	1397375	10/30/12	i can honestly say that this guy is the worst math teacher i have ever had. he continuously talks using jargon that only a math major would understand. Only way to learn anything is by reading the textbook...Run while you can!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1	1397375	10/25/10	He is terrible!! He literally mumbles so you can't understand him, he writes everything on the board in cursive so you're lost. He doesn't explain anything and assumes you understand his rambling about math and his personal life. Drop his class & take his wife, Catherine Leary!!!!! she's a saint
St. Bonaventure University	Francis Christian Leary	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	1397375	3/18/10	The worst teacher ever. Boring, continuously talks about his family. Tests all relate to trig functions. Not recommended.
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	131	2	1	2	2	174760	3/24/13	Levine is not what I would call a good professor. He doesn't really explain things at all. I took this course to try computer science and after this class, I realized I never want to take another CS again. He loves to hear himself talk and is really annoying. His quizzes are SO SO HARD. Look for someone else, only pick him if it's the last resort
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	102	2	1	1	2	174760	11/15/10	He literally speaks about 8 times more then is even useful. He just talks and talks, tries to be funny/interesting/thought-provoking but he is really just annoying more then anything.
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	1	Computer Science		1	3	2	3	174760	3/27/08	I've had him for 4 cs classes. 3 out of 4 were horrible. He likes to hear himself talk & doesn't convey the message clearly. Very bright guy, knows what he's talking about, just doesn't know how to explain it well enough to the students. If you do get a chance, take him for Computer Organization; everything else, try to get Andrianoff or Hunkins.
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	1	Computer Science	151	3	3	2	1	174760	10/17/06	hes obnoxious
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	120	2	2	1	1	174760	3/2/06	WOW..what a weirdo and is he a teacher? cuz seriously he tells us to just look through the book to find your answer. it is halfway through the course and he literally hasnt taught us anything yet.

St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	231	2	2	2	NULL	174760	3/30/03	When trying to ask for help, never gets to the point, just drones on and on

St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	2	Computer Science	232	3	4	3	3	174760	5/15/10	He is a really nice guy. Class is mostly 8 quizes and he drops the lowest 3. There are two projects and a final. Pretty simple class. Material is hard but he helps you out alot in terms of grades
St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	231	1	1	2	2	174760	11/27/07	Horrible... loves to hear his own voice and has no idea what the hell hes talking about.... have fun

St. Bonaventure University	David Levine	2.3	0	Computer Science	231	3	2	2	NULL	174760	3/28/03	Loves the sound of his own voice and very eclectic example (inheritance- well, you want your parents money but not their playboy collection when they die, right?) Sometimes unhelpful due to the sheer volume of his comments.

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Mackowski	4.5	2	Journalism	241	4	4	4	3	173054	4/26/09	A really nice guy and he runs a very casual class. He expects an honest effort but he won't burden you. Take him at least once if you can.

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Mackowski	4.5	2	Journalism	110	2	5	4	2	173054	11/11/11	Chris is honestly a great teacher! The grade on your first paper will shock you but he's only pointing out your errors. If you make an honest effort, your grades will increase on every paper.

St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	2	Chemistry	101	2	5	5	2	1042201	5/26/09	Best facial hair on campus!! He drinks the Champagne of Beers (MHL) and dances like an island. His favorite element is Molybdenum and has a true passion for what he teaches. Get on his good side by being excited in class.
St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	5	5	1042201	10/28/08	For any idiot who thinks this is a bad teacher should jump off a bridge. Manke is the man. His tests make you think a lot as well as his homework, but don't worry because if you get anything over a 75 on the tests you'll prob get an A in the course. He definitely knows the material because he's a freakin genius, and he is a really chill prof.
St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	2	Chemistry	102	1	4	3	3	1042201	5/3/08	The Hottest professor on campus. His chalk wings go well with his polo, makes him look like an angel from the back. Enjoys seeing what students "attempt" on test questions, while downing a 6-pack of beer. Helpful when needed, just don't follow him to his car... Best class: Blowing "stuff" up, and his hangover ppt on the Jets win over Patriots...
St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	1	Chemistry	101	1	3	2	1	1042201	10/23/07	Tests are hard, homework is impossible unless you work with other people, and he speaks in a monotone that no one can ever understand.

St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	0	Chemistry	102	2	2	2	1	1042201	3/10/09	Seriously confusing. He didn't care about anything except the Giants. He would go on about a really hard topic for like ten minutes and then say but you don't really need to know that!
St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	2	Chemistry	101	1	4	4	4	1042201	5/10/08	he talks in monotone so get used to it, he's helpful but only if youre patient, if he laughs at you or smiles he likes you, helpful outside of class, likes boys better than girls and likes to blow things up, take him over godbout he CURVES
St. Bonaventure University	David Manke	3.6	2	Chemistry	101	1	4	3	1	1042201	5/3/08	I think nights after tests he sits at home getting a few good laughs with a 30 pack of Bud Light..

A couple 6 pg. papers to do per class-but it's really just an easy way to keep up the grade. plus they helped reinforce material. She grades fair, teaches clearly, & is always willing to help. She's sweet & nice--sort of like a mom-away-from-home. I'd recommend her to anyone.

St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	0	Psychology	315	1	1	2	1	285907	5/2/12	condescending whenever I would ask a question felt that he openly disliked me nothing like course description not understanding towards students who had no interest in the subject and expected all students to have as great of interest in it as him. I would never recommend this professor to another student.
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	0	Psychology		1	1	1	4	285907	12/19/08	not helpful. rude. doesn't listen to students. doesn't even teach the subject... relys on the TA's and the textbook. If you're a psych major you have to get use to his kind of grading.
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	1	Psychology	201	1	4	2	2	285907	3/17/08	He's very knowledgeable but his language is at another level which makes it difficult to understand what he's teaching you.
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	2	Psychology	101	2	5	4	4	285907	2/2/07	sooo cute.
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	1	Psychology	343	2	3	3	2	285907	10/22/06	Nice guy, but the material is HARD and he doesn't do a very good job teaching it. Lots of pop quizzes too.
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	0	Psychology	101	1	1	3	4	285907	12/24/05	Horrible Teacher! hated every minute of the class because he is so monotone and never is clear when he tries to answer you. Also, doesn't care if you are doing poorly in the class when you ask for help. Do NOT take!!!

Makes something that could be fairly easy to understand very difficult!
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	2	Psychology	201	2	4	4	4	285907	2/7/08	Really nice guy. Knows what he does, and adds perspective to the mostly "how are you feeling" psych teachers here by throwing in bio related stuff. Can get a little...off track and hard to learn from...
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	0	Psychology	343	1	2	1	2	285907	1/4/07	nice guy but horrible teacher. he makes simple material seem very hard because he speaks at another level that no one can understand. he gives a pop quiz every week and his tests are impossible. u are better off reading the text to understand what is going on in the class but even the text ranges from 50-80 pages a chapter!
St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	0	Psychology	222	1	2	1	2	285907	3/15/06	His lectures are very boring and often unclear. I usually did not listen to him in class but rather read the book the whole time. The book is more thorough than he is so make sure you read!

St. Bonaventure University	Darryl Mayeaux	3.0	1	Psychology	222	4	4	2	3	285907	12/2/04	A very smart, very friendly professor. Doesn't always answer questions clearly though, and lectures can sometimes be boring.

St. Bonaventure University	Bart Lambert	3.5	1	Social Science	105	4	3	2	NULL	92203	7/2/03	I found that he wasn't open to other perpectives.

St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	121	3	5	4	5	201432	11/15/11	She is a great professor. She does everything step by step. You should go to her class everyday to understand everything. If you need extra help she is always there to help you. There are alot of opportunities to get extra credit and get a good grade in her class. She makes you work but you learn.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	122	4	5	4	2	201432	1/15/11	She's a really quirky old lady and can sometimes be hard to understand during class cause she sometimes rushes, but if you do well on the group work and go to the review session you'll be fine. I took it once and I got an A-.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	122	2	5	4	2	201432	5/19/10	Leary definitely likes things her way, but she is very nice and willing to help. Pay attention, take notes, and DO THE HOMEWORK. she doesn't collect it or even look at it, but they are the same kind of questions on the test. She is kind of crazy, but it's obvious she loves her job and she likes her students. She wants the best for all of us
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	122	3	4	5	4	201432	10/27/09	great teacher, very helpful loved her. explained things very well but you have to pay attention and do homework
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	145	2	5	4	1	201432	3/23/08	Great person, very strict on her policies, but if you do the HW no reason why you shouldn't get an A.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	0	Mathematics	121	1	1	1	1	201432	6/27/07	Worst teacher I have ever encountered in my 12 years of education. If you want to fail take this class. I hate her! Shes the worst human ever!
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	145	5	5	5	5	201432	3/16/06	This class was extremely boring, but you dont have to show up and its almost impossible to get anything lower than an A.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	145	4	3	5	3	201432	11/9/05	WOW, 145 is not a math class. I felt like a i was in preschool coloring again. Yes you do color. pointless but a great lady she is.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	1	Mathematics	121	1	3	3	1	201432	10/19/05	I dont think that anyone who finds people failing to be humorous should get a good review. she teaches okay however she makes you feel dumb when you ask questions too much. shell drag it out and make sure everyone knows who u are and what you asked. i would never take her again
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	145	4	4	4	3	201432	10/5/05	She likes to talk too much, but she's a good teacher. Gives a lot of extra credit so it's impossible to fail her class. Easy class, great teacher.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	121	3	4	3	4	201432	4/3/11	Shes a nice prof. She makes sure you understand the material and always have ways to get bonuses towards grades. Very helpful to help with any problems.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	121	2	5	5	2	201432	10/21/10	love her, but not everyone does. pay attention, ask questions, do the homework, do the extra credit, and there's no way you get less than a B. She's strict but she knows her stuff and wants you to know it too. just stay on her good side!!
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	121	2	5	5	4	201432	5/16/10	DO THE Home Work! and go to her office hour.. this is the only way you are GUARANTEE an A or B. material is not that hard! but is highly complicated ask for help. shes a sweet heart but very STRICT with her rules!
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	1	Mathematics	121	2	3	3	4	201432	12/23/08	She is really strict about her policies and likes things a certain way, but she really wants you to understand the content and you can tell she likes her job. Overall I like her

St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	1	Mathematics	121	2	3	3	1	201432	10/5/05	She moves too fast for most students and trys to laugh it off. she always says shes there to help but if you ask the wrong question she makes you feel incommpetent of anything else. she thinks she funny when shes not and expects students to laugh. shes also alergic to chalk which she always gets all over herself- thats the ONLY entertainment that stops you from watching the clock or looking out the window
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	0	Mathematics	145	1	1	1	1	201432	5/12/05	If you're math-challenged, and you take her class, you're screwed! It's academic suicide. Be very leery of Leary's class as we used to say. If you're good at math, chances are that you learned her stuff in your highchair, but for those of us you who just never got it, she won't help you get it.
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	201432	4/15/05	Great teacher. She is clear and always offers extra help. If you don't understand, ask her. Go to her during office hours, it helps! Do the homework and review sheets before tests and you'll do fine!
St. Bonaventure University	Catherine Leary	3.1	2	Mathematics	151	2	5	5	5	201432	12/7/04	Dr. Leary is the Man. He's funny and prolly the smartest man on campus. Even though he moves really fast through the course work, if u keep up with him and get extra help whenever you need it, you'll do fine.

St. Bonaventure University	Elizabeth Littell-Lamb	2.4	0	History	361	2	1	3	2	753518	4/1/07	She is very smart but when it comes to teaching, she spends half the class thinking about how to word what she wants to say. Most of the class was an analysis of why an event is in the textbook. Her essay questions were difficult. she also has a wierd attendance policy of emailing her after we participated to get points.

As long as you take good notes in class and study the notes for the test you will get the A. Just remember that you will never get out of class even a minute early.
St. Bonaventure University	David Matz	3.9	2	History	103	4	5	5	4	111721	5/22/06	A really up-beat kind of teacher; which is good because he seems to like to teach all his classes in the morning. It's really easy to take notes from him, as he will generally give you enough time to write down pretty much all of what he's saying. Occasionally there will be a test question that deals with very specific information, but not often.

You definitely have to do the work to get a good grade and attendance is highly recommended. He's a tell it like it is guy and he doesn't like slackers. I really liked taking a class with him, though.
St. Bonaventure University	Brian McAllister	3.8	2	Accounting	361	1	4	4	2	621968	12/3/08	Fuuny guy likes to curse. Hardest tests. If you dont study and do the hw then have fun passing.

St. Bonaventure University	Brian McAllister	3.8	0	Accounting	202	1	2	1	1	621968	7/13/05	HORRIBLE class notes. Plays the favorites game. Don't believe me? He didn't even TELL our class where the review session was going to be held...yet the other class knew (I asked someone and they said he explained it in class). He explains things the same way when you go to see him as he does in class. If I didn't understand it the first time..
St. Bonaventure University	Brian McAllister	3.8	2	Accounting	361	3	5	4	4	621968	5/19/10	challenging topics, key is to go to class and make sure he knows you

St. Bonaventure University	Brian McAllister	3.8	2	Accounting	202	3	4	4	5	621968	10/18/06	BMAC is the man. You people are all making a huge deal about how horrible of a teacher is, maybe if you actually stayed awake in his class and studied for a bit you'd do good..welcome to college der. This man is funny as hell. Take him if you can!
St. Bonaventure University	Brian McAllister	3.8	2	Accounting	202	2	4	3	1	621968	5/18/05	Hard to rate this guy. On one hand, he's very helpful when you see him during office hours. However, the class notes are HORRIBLE. On tests, certain questions will ask things (i.e. "what does relevant range mean?") that you have never even HEARD of before. Actual accounting stuff isn't too bad, just where he makes you explain everything.

St. Bonaventure University	Becky Misenhiemer	1.5	0	Theater	101	3	2	2	4	1447965	4/8/13	I took this course for the Art & Lit credit. Truthfully, she's not a horrible professor; she grades easy. However the amount of work involved in this introductory course is just too much. We had over five presentations and she expects us to take on the roles of people in theater. If I could go back I would not take this course.
St. Bonaventure University	Fr. Dominic Monti	3.7	2	Religion		4	5	5	4	564503	10/20/05	This class was very easy. All you have to do is show up. He lectures the whole time and you write a breif paragraph to turn in everyday about the reading which is basically your thoughts and it is a 100 no matter what you say. There are a few quizzes that you can pass without even reading. He is so cute!! and soo nice!! i recommend him! :)
St. Bonaventure University	Fr. Dominic Monti	3.7	1	Religion		3	3	2	4	564503	2/1/05	Boring and opininated.
St. Bonaventure University	Fr. Dominic Monti	3.7	2	Religion		3	4	3	3	564503	5/29/05	Without a shadow of a doubt, I can say that Monti (brief stint as president of SBU) is one of the most knowledgable theologians on campus. He is not the most engaging public speakers and may hail from Bradford, but he'll throw you some knowledge about the Church that'll surely be forgotten in a generation or two - worth the admission price alone.

St. Bonaventure University	Carol McNall	4.4	2	Journalism	101	4	5	5	4	512760	7/25/10	One of the best teachers at bonas. She is not just an amazing teacher,but a wonderful woman. Tests aren't bad if you read the book and look at the study guide.Her enthusiam is contagious.
St. Bonaventure University	Carol McNall	4.4	2	Journalism		3	5	5	2	512760	11/19/07	Not the most exciting lecturer, can get a little boring, but she's a great person. A lot of memorizing on the review sheet she hands out for the three tests during the semester, but oonly 25 questions on the test, a final paper, and a couple of written hw assignments. I would take her again, she's cool.
St. Bonaventure University	Carol McNall	4.4	2	Journalism		4	4	4	2	512760	11/8/05	I had her for Intro and newswriting (she's my advisor, too) and i love her. She is a great woman. the class can get boring sometimes but that happens with most other professors, too. We have become good friends and she is going out of her way to help me get an internship this summer.take her class and take the time to get to know her.

Try not to fall asleep. I would assume she doesn't like it. Participate and make sure you pay attention. Take notes cause everything she mentions in class are on the test. There are only two essay. No need to stress.

St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business	306	2	1	1	4	670840	10/23/12	He would be a good professor if he spent time teaching instead of talking about trains and astronauts. I now know more about the Apollo 11 mission, but when it came to exams, I had to teach myself. So if you're good at self-learning and don't mind wasting time in class, this course is for you!
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business	306	3	1	1	4	670840	10/4/11	Moran has useless projects that have nothing to do with class. have fun sitting for hours trying to figure out timelines for rockets and other nonsense. he is completely and utterly useless as a teacher because he does not even know what he is teaching at times. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TOO!!!!!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	2	Business	201	3	5	4	4	670840	11/5/10	Very nice guy, he will help you in anyway possible. He is a very smart man, he tells corny jokes but it makes class fun. Fyi he went to school at Clarkson there for he has to be smart. People need to know there stuff before posting comments on this website.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business	301	5	1	2	3	670840	5/19/10	easy A but you need to teach yourself. he gives you old tests and new tests have almost same questions as old tests painful to sit through class though strict attendance policy

Also, he is slightly smarter than people give him credit for. He does not come across very bright but most certainly knows the material he is presenting.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	2	Business		5	5	5	1	670840	12/7/05	Very fun class. He is a great teacher who will help you out any way he can.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	1	Business	101	5	2	3	3	670840	10/27/11	Strict attendance policy. Gives a TON of homework, but extra credit on all of it. Follow the syllabus, takes 5 points off final average for almost anything. Easy A, tests are all from homework. Lots of pointless "field trips." & plan on using 3/4 of your printer pages, lots of useless printing, especially since the syllabus is about 40 pages long.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business	306	2	2	2	2	670840	12/20/10	That class was extremely demanding. There were so many projects constantly. He taught and didn't even understand what he was teaching himself. He would stop sometimes and try to figure out his own powerpoints. His powerpoints were from 2006 also. He goes through the math so quickly that no one knew what was going on.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business		2	1	1	1	670840	9/25/10	Worst teacher ever. Avoid taking him if possible.. Uses all of your pages with a 92 page syllabus. Way too many group projects. And too demanding!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business	322	5	1	1	1	670840	11/2/06	Painful class. Easy A. Moran's a nice guy but he is a complete moron, has no idea what's going on & gives you too much meaningless work. Prepare to be bored to death. And, o yea, forget about skipping class (after 2 skips you automatically fail.)
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	0	Business		2	1	1	3	670840	3/31/06	One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, but a complete joke of a teacher. Easily my least favorite class ever.
St. Bonaventure University	Terry Moran	2.5	2	Business		5	4	3	1	670840	1/19/06	Good guy and an easy A, but he does't have a clue what it is going on in this class. Plan on re-teaching yourself his lesson plans and doing hours of homework that he barely checks.
St. Bonaventure University	John Mulryan	2.3	0	English	103	3	1	1	2	236564	4/7/13	A former genius; simply senile now. Class is just him rambling incoherently. He's so disorganized, too. His attendance policy isn't strict (only worth 5 points overall). You get study guides for the tests so it's easy to do well (though, sometimes I think he just pulls grades out of a hat). You don't really need the book, Google works as well.
St. Bonaventure University	John Mulryan	2.3	2	English	427	2	4	3	5	236564	11/13/08	The man is arrogant, but he's so intelligent and so kind. He knows so much about mythology and literature. His exams are tough but one learns a significant amount in the courses. Take good notes, read the material, and think, and you'll have an A. Also, don't let his arrogance bring you down.
St. Bonaventure University	John Mulryan	2.3	2	English	537	3	5	3	5	236564	2/17/07	Everyone hates Dr. Mulryan because he's hard and makes them actually work. What most people don't take the time to realize is that the material isn't that hard if you try even a little bit, and Dr. M's also one of the nicest profs at SBU. He would do anything to help students if they'd just ask.

St. Bonaventure University	John Mulryan	2.3	0	English	103	1	2	1	4	236564	9/26/08	Run. As fast as you possibly can. You can tell he used to be a genius but he has passed his peak. Class consists of him rambling with what seems to be no point or no end. I couldn't learn a thing from him, read all the text and you'll be fine, but without any social life.
St. Bonaventure University	John Mulryan	2.3	1	English		3	3	2	1	236564	11/8/05	This class was so boring. the only reason i ever went was the two crazy kids that mulryan made fun of all time. You never know what this guy is gonna say, its hilarious.

St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	1	Philosophy	111	4	3	2	2	368941	11/8/11	Easy grader. As long as you go to class and pay attention when you go over the subjects for the paper you are fine. Lets you correct your midterm and any paper to lift your grade. Singles people out and will call on those same people all class. Very argue-mental is you do not agree with him. Boring class, but easy grade.
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	0	Philosophy	111	4	1	2	3	368941	1/11/10	Yeah, he definitely singles people out, so pay attention. Even if it's a little bit. I zoned out a lot, but I was safe. He claims to have an open mind. He will hear any argument, but most of the time he won't stop arguing unless you agree. I really hated this class because all our papers were based on Bill Moyers shows. Let's see some variety, man
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	2	Philosophy	410	4	5	5	5	368941	11/9/09	Murphy is a great professor for the right students. He isn't right for everyone. However, if you love to think, and can learn through conversation, definetely take a class with Murphy. Also, he is brilliant and also incredibly odd, but he has a way of making the mundane fascinating.
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	0	Philosophy	111	4	1	2	1	368941	12/4/08	awful, awful, awful! probably one of the worst teachers i've ever had. he is so boring and he talks to one student the entire class and you definitely don't want to be the one he is talking to. although the class is not hard it is super boring and pointless. he's a liberal and definitely lets you know. super annoying.
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	0	Philosophy	107	1	1	1	1	368941	3/28/08	Good. Lord. What an awful teacher.

St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	0	Philosophy	101	4	1	2	NULL	368941	3/20/04	He is awful!! His tests are so hard. He thinks that everything is easy and you should already know everything.

St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	2	Philosophy	340	5	3	4	3	368941	4/7/10	He is one of my favorite professors this semester. He's highly intelligent and knows the material. He digresses a lot, and does single students out. So be sure to interest him, and introduce yourself to him. He's a great prof, but he can be boring. His essays are graded easily, too. He's always available. He wants you to learn.
St. Bonaventure University	Anthony Murphy	3.1	2	Philosophy	400	3	5	5	4	368941	12/27/09	I am not sure why Murphy gets bad ratings except that maybe because the education/soc/do-as-little-as-possible majors can't process basic symbolic logic. That and because if Murphy goes into a theoretical discussion, many students,instead of participating, just go to sleep. If you have a brain and want a clear description of phil, take Murphy.

He is unfair. The material could have been interesting but wasn't. Professor does not give you the tools to learn or to pass the class. I spent more time studying for this class than any other and got the worst grade I've gotten in my college career.
St. Bonaventure University	Miguel Narvaez	2.2	1	Physical Education	107	5	2	3	3	1180403	8/7/10	Miguel has changed a lot since last year. His tests have become easier because now he teaches you what is on the tests. If you read the chapters and do the assignments, it is hard not to get an A in his classes.
St. Bonaventure University	Miguel Narvaez	2.2	0	Physical Education	306	1	1	1	2	1180403	12/15/08	The class only consisted of two tests for grades. There were assignments due during the semester but never any feedback on them. The class was boring. The professor was not available or helpful. I would not recommend this professor to anyone for any class. Waste of time and money.
St. Bonaventure University	Miguel Narvaez	2.2	1	Physical Education	312	1	2	4	4	1180403	10/26/08	He is a very very nice guy and likes to joke around with you. problem is that his tests are absolutely ridiculously hard and every test is cumilitive. there is no other work outside of class other than tests. he says he is willing to help, but doesn't follow through
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy	111	1	1	1	3	220931	5/19/10	Nuttal is ridiculous. In Clar111 (Comp & Crit 2) the material was very hard to understand and was never explained by him in a way that was understandable. Honestly I felt like the whole class was in another language. Nuttal is not helpful. HE'S AWFUL. He curves everything, even our papers. A 51 got you a C. absolutely ridiculous. Do not take him!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	1	Philosophy	104	3	3	3	3	220931	1/4/07	very hard to concentrate because the class is boring i still dont understand anything we learned in class we never used the textbook so dont buy it. hes a nice guy but doesnt know how to teach the class is all lecture and there are no notes to take he gives u outlines before the test but the tests is all essay he doesnt except **** answers

St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	3	220931	10/27/05	He was one of my favorite professors ever. He really thought about things and encouraged students to do so too. Test were all essay and if you read they were fine. Classes were easy. Quizes during second half were super easy if you read...easy true/false. Presentations were enjoyable. I would definitely take him again, except I am in science.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy		2	1	1	3	220931	5/12/05	I took Logic and Inquiry a while ago. I still have no idea what he was talking about at 8:30 in the morning. Nice guy, but I always thought combining mathematics with linguistics was an abomination, but I guess that sort of statement showcases my ignorance. Anyway, steer clear  very confusing.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy	104	4	3	4	1	220931	2/27/05	Very boring dont forget your pillow. Dont think he cares if your in class or if you sleep thru it while your there. Way to much BS thats not interesting but seems to be pretty easy. Presentations are BS.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		3	3	4	2	220931	11/11/04	He's not bad. his exams are kinda difficult, but the lectures turn into class discussions and can be funny. He usaully curves exams.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	NULL	220931	2/11/04	Good teacher...knows the material and is extremely helpful. Also, he was very helpful in helping me get into and choose a good law school
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy	111	5	1	1	NULL	220931	6/11/03	This guy is by far the worst teacher ever. That's what makes him so great. He never comes to class, and he doesn't care if you do either. He grades on a curve, so as long as you're mildly intelligent, you can't do bad in his classes.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy	104	2	1	1	1	220931	4/15/09	class is very boring. topics taught are unclear and poorly taught. quizzes are true/false not too hard. very little work all semester until a research paper and presentation are assigned that are 50% of the grade, and he is an unfairly difficult grader.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	1	220931	12/16/05	Class is boring, and the tests are all essay. But if you just study the outlines he gives you it's an easy A.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	1	Philosophy		2	2	3	1	220931	11/8/05	This class is extremely boring, there is tons of reading and the tests are all essays. He seems like a nice man and he doesn't care if you come to class but you would be better off to go then you don't have to read everything in the world.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		4	3	4	4	220931	9/19/05	I found Nuttall's class very interesting. He was more than eager to help if you catch up to him after class or if you have a question during class. Good about responding to emails, but wasn't always available in his office. Great class, if you do the reading and take good notes on the cases you will do well.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy		2	1	1	3	220931	4/20/05	horrible teacher, never showed to class, went through material too quickly and wasn't very helpful. he grades on a curve but if u don't understand anything and he never shows for office horus its easy to do bad...he's the reason I left Bonaventure
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy		5	2	2	4	220931	12/1/04	teaches the same thing in every law class. no new info. friend who took class after me had all the same handouts and even take home tests!!! horrible
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	1	Philosophy		3	3	2	NULL	220931	3/20/04	Awful... Don't him if you can avoid it. He's boring. He hands out notes and then reads them to you. He adds nothing to the class. He seems like a very intelligent man, however. I wish he could teach better. He does grade on a curve, which is a plus.
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	2	Philosophy		5	4	4	NULL	220931	9/27/03	Funny and good and spurring discussion--when he comes to class, anyway
St. Bonaventure University	Steven Nuttall	2.5	0	Philosophy		2	1	1	NULL	220931	6/11/03	If you can avoid this man if at all possible, do so for your own sake. He never show up to class, does not know ho to teach (reading the book was much more helpful for me) and moves on to new topics regardless of if you understand material or not.
St. Bonaventure University	Peter  Palumbo	4.5	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	4	3	1791685	1/11/13	Always explains the lab before you do it and will answer questions on anything you are unclear onn before lab. Will go through the entire lab with you if you are confused. Makes review sheets for the midtem and final and will answer any questions you have about the concepts on the sheets before you take the tests. Great guy too.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	203	5	5	5	4	501508	4/4/12	Reminds me of Joe Pesci sort of.He's a good guy.Tests are all essays though-so be prepared to write & study. I'm an Eng. major-& he's my advisor-so I have no problems w/ the guy's teaching style. If you do the work as outlined & get help when needed you'll get an A. And he usually bumps everyone's final grade up one letter.How much nicer can u get
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	203	3	4	4	4	501508	3/18/12	He really is a great guy. I was in danger of getting kicked out of school and he helped me out a lot.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	0	English	101	1	1	1	1	501508	11/15/09	I would rather watch paint dry than spend 2 minutes in this guys class. he makes off colored jokes, can't remember students names, smells ungoddly awful, is the worst grader ever (he doesn't even know why he marks off), he is flat out the worst prof i have ever had! i have never learned so much about nothing in my entire life! terrible class!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	0	English	110	1	1	1	1	501508	5/14/09	WORST EVER! He is a total rude person and fails everyone for any reason he can. I recomend all students to NOT HAVE HIM! to prove how rude he is he gave me an F because my vocab and sentence structure was "too strong" therefore he thinks i stole the work
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	0	English	101	1	2	1	2	501508	3/31/08	Does not clarify how he wants the assignments done, do not take this teacher. Grades way to hard and you have a paper due almost every week. Readings and paragraphs are due for every class you go to. Participation is mandatory or you don't pass. He does not use e-mail so he is hard to get a hold of. Do not take him!

St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	101	4	5	5	5	501508	12/9/04	Great teacher. He always comes to class with a smile on his face, and it is obvious that he enjoys his job. All opinions are treated with respect, and he gives many opportunities to participate, though by no means is anyone forced to. Tests aren't too bad; take notes and you'll be ok.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	203	3	4	5	4	501508	11/16/04	He reminds me of Al Pacino, I love going to class just to look at him. His reading assignments tend to be hard...but just do them. It's just a 100 if you do it. So do it, then he fully explains it in class making the tests elementary easy!!!!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	1	English	101	2	2	3	4	501508	3/29/12	He is a really great guy and is willing to help but his work load is HEAVY! Our class had a essays due every week and an exam every week. We also had 3-4 readings per assignment. If you can handle a heavy world load this professor is for you!
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	200	5	5	5	3	501508	9/24/11	Great guy good teacher
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	0	English	101	1	1	1	1	501508	11/15/09	He is by far the worst professor that I have come across on this campus. His classes are deathly boring and you will seriously dread even thinking about class. There is an assignment due every single class along with a ton of reading. He is very little help when it comes to understanding what is read. DO NOT take IJ with him. You've been warned!
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	0	English	110	1	1	1	2	501508	3/22/09	DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM!!! HE ENJOYS FAILING PEOPLE ON THEIR PAPERS. There are no other assignments but the papers and he will fail you on those so you're lucky if you come out of the class with a C.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English		4	4	4	3	501508	11/10/05	Looks a tiny bit like paul mccartney. Real nice guy, loves life.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	203	4	3	4	2	501508	11/8/05	tons of reading and boring lectures. test were pretty hard, too.
St. Bonaventure University	Patrick Panzarella	3.1	2	English	109	5	4	4	3	501508	12/2/04	Easy assignments, easy tests (MC and simple short answer), very little work. Very friendly.
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	101	3	5	4	2	368944	5/19/10	DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK. never opened it once, you have all the information you need to know from her powerpoints. Kristin Paul is very nice, and her tests are predictable. Just study the materials she gives you in class. Attendance is not mandatory, which can be nice. I would definitely recommend her.
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	301	3	5	5	5	368944	3/31/06	By far the best prof at SBU and the best looking as well.
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	301	2	5	5	5	368944	1/26/06	She is by far the most knowledgable professor St. Bonaventure has to offer (as well as the prettiest). She gives you a real world education. She is always available to help you with the material. The material is fairly difficult but she makes it as easy as she possibly can. I highly recommend her...she is a fantastic professor!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	301	4	5	5	NULL	368944	3/20/04	She is the best!! Take her for every class you can. She has no attendence policy but it's helpful to go to her class because she will tell you everything that you need to know to pass her tests. A true JEM!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	0	Finance	101	1	3	1	1	368944	5/16/10	DO NOT BUY TEXT BOOK! worst prof ever. just guide yourself from power point don't waist time in class or text book [not helpful]
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	101	5	5	5	4	368944	3/28/06	Very helpful and very clear. Professors need to learn from her. If its on the overhead its fair game for the test. This way you dont need to memorize useless information. Awesome professor.
St. Bonaventure University	Kristin Paul	4.5	2	Finance	301	4	5	5	5	368944	2/27/05	Real nice lady. helpful, smart and interesting, as long as you want to do well you can reccomended. Take her husband also he is great.

St. Bonaventure University	Laura Peterson	4.4	2	Music		4	5	5	5	176142	12/4/04	A really knowledgeable woman, she holds a lot of facts in her head and passes them on to students.

St. Bonaventure University	Laura Peterson	4.4	2	Music		3	5	5	NULL	176142	7/24/03	She is just simply the best person in the whole world as well as the best teacher. She will answer every question and if she has no idea, she will research it for you and give you a full oral report on it!

St. Bonaventure University	Michael Russell	2.5	0	Business	612	2	2	2	4	173052	12/2/08	Doesn't teach. Gives way too much out of class work for a grad level course. 10-15 page research paper, 5 page paper and interview with executive, weekly group marketing simulation meetings, Marketing plan, 3 tests, tons of reading since he doesn't teach us himself.

One of my favorite professors at Bonas.
St. Bonaventure University	Tom Schaeper	3.3	2	History	103	2	5	5	1	313359	12/24/10	easy class if you make study guides from his online questions. you actually have to do the work, but if you pay attention in class you can skip the readings. yes, more work than a typical clare class, but not bad at all.
St. Bonaventure University	Tom Schaeper	3.3	2	History	103	5	5	5	2	313359	5/2/08	Easy class if you have half a brain and go to class. There's nothing on the tests that you don't go over in class. The reading's not even that necessary; just pay attention during lectures and you'll do fine.

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	1	Finance	421	3	3	3	4	270718	5/8/07	I dont know why everyone thinks this guy is so hard. His tests are actually really easy if you spend time studying. He doesnt give you any formulas for the test so you better be able to remember them. As long as you do the practice problems you should be fine.
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	2	Finance	401	1	4	3	4	270718	12/14/06	Tough professor and tough class. Peterson is one smart guy and seems like something out of a Dick Tracy movie. Loves to say "names Jeff Peterson...PHD"

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	2	Finance	421	4	5	5	5	270718	4/2/11	Is one of the smartest professors on campus. If you can prove you excel in Finance he will take very good care of you and help place you into the world of Finance. His Exams are challenging bc. they're straight from the book, but in class he teaches something different. He likes to show off how he can derive equations to the 4th decimal place.
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	2	Finance		2	4	5	4	270718	2/9/10	Great classes, great professor, great guy - but not so great if you'rean idiot or if you can't "do math." Very knowledgable, class isa lot of work - very quantitative but well worth taking.
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	1	Finance	604	1	3	3	3	270718	4/30/09	This prof. gives next to impossible questions for you to solve out of the book. Then you go over the answers the night before the exam, so there is no time to prepare. However, he did curve high so if you aveage from 50 to 65 you will ge a B. If you average 66-89 you get a B+. Avoid him. He should goto FredieMac repeat Kellerman's action.Good luck
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	2	Finance	421	3	5	5	5	270718	5/10/07	He will teach you the potential of the West Virginia investment strategy.

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	2	Finance	301	2	4	3	3	270718	5/1/07	He's not THAT bad. He can grade tough at times but the material is somewhat difficult for beginners if you don't put the time into it. He's helpful.

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff Peterson	3.4	0	Finance		1	1	1	3	270718	2/23/06	Completely arrogant. Stares at the board for two minutes solving equations in his head, only getting it right 75% of the time, to impress the class then decides because he can do it no one should need a calculator for the tests. He doesn't even use "easy" numbers either, the hardest part of his class is doing long division. Absolutely ridiculous.

St. Bonaventure University	Paula Scraba	1.4	0	Education	105	3	1	1	3	92199	5/8/11	This teacher is absolutely clueless! She shows up to class extremely unprepared and often times just leaves class to run her own personal errands. If your goal is to become less intelligent then this class is for you.
St. Bonaventure University	Paula Scraba	1.4	0	Education	313	4	1	1	2	92199	3/21/10	The worst professor I have ever encountered. Her syllabus asked for 1 page papers every week, yet in order to get an A a 3 page paper was needed. Her grammar in e-mails is horrific, and she is incapable of completing a thought in class. She didn't know any of the material. Highly unorganized. Don't take unless you like being frustrated.

St. Bonaventure University	Paula Scraba	1.4	1	Education	101	4	3	2	5	92199	8/7/10	Love Dr. Paula. Her classes are a lot of work, which seems tedious at times, but it's not that bad. She says your daily assignments should be a page (which is average, but she gives you a B). Yes you need to write about 2.5-3 for an A, but you can copy straight from the book.. It's PHED 101.. not rocket science.
St. Bonaventure University	Paula Scraba	1.4	0	Education	303	3	1	1	4	92199	12/15/08	Professor gives out grades. It is not based on your work. Grades are based on gender and whether or not she likes you. Very unclear what is expected of you. Grades papers without even looking at them. People turned in questions for the wrong test and she didn't even notice. Should not be teaching at this level.

St. Bonaventure University	Ed Simone	2.5	1	Theater	299	5	1	4	3	232017	11/4/11	Dr. Simone is a very passionate man, but comes off very self-centered. If you are one to do theater just for fun, do not join this program because it is work and no play.
St. Bonaventure University	Ed Simone	2.5	2	Theater	301	4	5	5	5	232017	11/3/06	Ed. can come across as self centered, but he really does care about the students he teaches; he just wants everyone to love his subjects as much as he does- and that's hard to do at Bonas, since the university doesn't choose to embrace them. Nice guy, seriously.

St. Bonaventure University	Richard Simpson	4.8	2	English		3	5	5	NULL	159616	5/30/03	Dr. Simpson, you are the MAN! Your kind words have helped a generation of young adults develop into more sophiscated and talented writers. You are a tremendous asset to Bonnies. When I was a freshman,you were (and still are)a great person and teacher.
St. Bonaventure University	Richard Simpson	4.8	2	English		4	5	5	NULL	159616	3/28/03	Now in grad school, I have to say his constant enthusiasm for new ideas reminds me what education is all about. His laid-back approach is a wonderful contrast to the enthusiasm. He's your man for advice, as well. What a guy...

St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	0	English	110	3	1	2	1	969368	10/17/11	Incredibly boring class. Simple essays to write, but he doesn't actually tell you what was wrong with it. Easy for women, but is much harder on men.
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	110	3	4	4	3	969368	11/30/09	He is the man, great guy. Even though class is useless, we've had good conversations. Fair grader, take him if possible
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	400	2	5	5	5	969368	5/13/08	Slagle is the man. Take as many classes as you can with him. Some teachers bring your intelligence level down, Slagle, however, works your mind and makes you think.
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	110	3	5	5	1	969368	12/14/07	He only makes an attendance policy because what he does in class is completely not needed and so incredibly boring. Papers are graded hard!!.. lots of work outside of class but he's a nice guy.
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	101	5	5	5	3	969368	5/19/10	Slagle is the best!! Not to mention a decent looking guy. He's one of the nicest and funniest teachers I've had. Intellectual Journey is awful, but Slagle made it pretty interesting and always made fun conversations. Kind of a hard paper grader, but awesome guy. Take him for everything you can!!
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	110	3	5	4	4	969368	11/30/09	Such a nice man! Very passionate about teaching. If you want to learn how to write well, take his class. He spends quite a bit of time workshopping students' work & offering feedback for each essay.
St. Bonaventure University	Jefferson Slagle	4.3	2	English	213	4	5	5	3	969368	3/28/08	Very passionate about what he does and is very imaginative and really provokes great discussion. He picks out some interesting books to read and is definitely worth taking.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	2	2	2	2	495431	10/23/10	She was hard to understand..dresses funny and looks over you when she teaches..If you like to study your book after class to comprehend what she taught, then take her and you'll get an A.. Only good thing was that she allows you to make "cheat sheets" for most of the exams.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	1	1	495431	6/19/10	DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!!! Doesn't matter if you were a Math lover, YOU WILL FAIL!! I dropped her class the second day. She came into class and just started teaching on the first day. I knew nothing she was talking about and the people around me was lost also. Save yourself, take Mrs. K, she's not that good either, but she's way better.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	2	1	495431	4/9/10	This prof is the opposite of what any student wants. Her class is a 50 minute lecture, with no student participation or checking to see if the class is following/comprehending. Assigns homework, but never checks it or goes over it. She curves tests greatly, but students are still failing. Her quizzes and tests are irrelevant. Aviod at all costs.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	2	1	495431	1/25/10	Never helps students
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	2	1	1	1	495431	4/9/08	doesn't explain how to do anything. looks at you like you just asked the most ridiculous question. dresses werid and possibly crossed eyed. only good thing is the extra credit she provides. if you hate math, i'd stay away and take a different prof.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	1	1	495431	11/26/07	Hard to understanding, and when you ask for help, she looks at you like you're an idiot for not getting it in the first place.

St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	2	1	495431	5/13/10	she is the worst math teacher i ever had. i knew it was going to be bad when at the beginning of the semester she just walked in did not introduce herself and just started the thing she called teaching.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	1	1	495431	2/3/10	She is pathetic. Honestly the worst teacher there could ever be. I'm surprised she still has a job. She is hard to follow, acts like you're stupid when you ask a question, is cross-eyed and wears hideous dresses. When I went to drop her class, she said "Some can do it-Some Can't" That's all she said. She could care less if you do well or not!!
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	1	Mathematics	107	2	3	2	1	495431	12/5/08	I hated this class. She fails to explain things in a comprehensible manner, and then requires you to know more than what she even managed to explain in the classroom. Disappointed to say the least...
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	495431	12/12/07	The class is harder than it needs to be, if I could go back I would have never taken this class with her. It was really awful.
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	107	1	1	2	1	495431	11/9/07	really confusing
St. Bonaventure University	 Stahl	1.4	0	Mathematics	101	2	2	1	2	495431	11/11/04	this lady is crazy. Her lectures are very confusing and her exams are more difficult than they need to be.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	1	Religion	206	3	3	3	3	528096	3/29/12	It's not a bad class, just make sure you pay attention to understand the information. Not having much relgious background, I kind of struggled with this course. But I recommend it to anyone. Talk to him in his office. He's willing to work with you, I'm sure.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	0	Religion	106	1	1	2	2	528096	11/17/09	His class requires wayyy too much work. In addition to a half hr of reading every night you have projects every week that take up a lot of time. He is an ass to people when they question his grades and will never give back points on a question even when the entire class gets it wrong. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion	106	5	5	4	1	528096	5/16/07	A really great guy who is eagar to help his students. i missed many classes but still managed to get an A
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion		5	5	5	5	528096	12/1/05	I had no religous background and got an A with ease. Just go to class and pay attention.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion	106	3	4	3	2	528096	11/8/05	He's a nice guy overrall. He asks all the time to play bball at night. Simple and down to the point grader. IF u do the assignments, do a lil bit of reading, and study for the tests, you'll do fine. I'm currently in the class and i don't do anything during class or read and i have an A. so yea. its that easy..Good GUy
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	0	Religion	106	5	2	2	5	528096	2/1/05	His opinion is the only opinion. Get used to it. :-(
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	0	Religion	106	1	2	1	2	528096	12/6/09	Class is ridiculously hard. Everyday is long and boring and if you miss it you automatically have to make up a quiz. His work takes forever to do and makes it hard to get a good grade in it especially if he does not agree with you.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion	106	5	5	3	1	528096	11/11/08	Stanley is hillarious. In class quizzes everday are pretty easy- doesnt really care if you go. If you dont have relgious backround it will be harder for you, i skipped atleast once a week and did fine
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion		4	5	5	1	528096	12/15/05	Very down to earth guy. His exams are hard but he lets you do takehomes if u want. If you speak up in class and do the readings you'll get an A.
St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	1	Religion	106	1	3	2	3	528096	11/10/05	If you are not a practicing Christian, you are probably going to stuggle in Chris' class. He has good intentions, but his lectures are confusing even when you read the assigned texts. If you have a religious backgroud, take his class--you will get somthing out of it. Otherwise, RUN!

St. Bonaventure University	Chris Stanley	3.2	2	Religion	106	4	5	5	5	528096	12/9/04	First, let me say that, if you choose to do so, you can have EVERY test (even the final exam!) be take home. Although he is Christian, he presents a very fair and unbiased look at Scriptures; as one of the main points of the class is to look at Scriptures as a historical scholar would. He's awesome
St. Bonaventure University	Jason Stupp	4.5	2	English		4	5	4	4	744893	3/2/06	Awesome guy. he really wants all of us to do good. A bit of a hard grader on the essays but thats normal for Comp & Crit teachers. Really funny and loves to make fun of everything in the outside world. Seems like a student and always willing to help. Get him. He's awesome
St. Bonaventure University	Jason Stupp	4.5	2	English	110	3	4	5	5	744893	11/2/05	What a stud!
St. Bonaventure University	Peter Schneible	4.0	2	Biology	331	4	5	3	5	1518184	12/24/10	great professor. while not very good at time management, still a great prof. take him
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology	103	4	5	5	2	315236	8/5/07	I barely did anything at St. Bonaventure University, for four years that is, and i made it out. I had Prof Schummer, and like people said you can get a d on the tests but still get a B. He was a real nice guy, and i always enjoyed going to his classes.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	1	Theology		3	3	3	2	315236	12/17/05	Yea he's a little kooky and does funny/scary things with his eyes and definitely missed at least 12 classes during the semester, but OK.

St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology	104	2	5	5	3	315236	4/15/05	If you don't know how to understand theological readings and write papers well this class will be very hard. Tests are easy all you have to do is go to class and pay attention, he explains everything clearly. Take him in the afternoon.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology	104	2	3	4	4	315236	10/11/04	This chain-smoking professor is what an ethics professor is all about. Although he does have a knack for leading a class into discussions(a rare quality at SBU), his reading quizzes were a little overwhelming in my first year. Take him as a sophomore.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology		1	4	4	NULL	315236	12/16/03	I personally, enjoyed the papers, they were the only way I really understood Kant and utiitarians, etc. True the tests are very hard, but the class is very interesting. Not an easy A, but a good bet to take if you don't want to be put to sleep.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology		4	4	3	4	315236	3/29/06	I love Schummer. He's funny and easy. His tests suck balls but I got D's and C's on his tests and passed with a B. Do well on quizzes and papers and you're gold.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	0	Theology	111	3	2	1	1	315236	12/12/05	He has a tendancy to not show up if a) the weather's bad, b) it's Friday or c) it's Monday. He also tends to stare out the window midsentence and zone out for about 5 minutes.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	0	Theology		2	2	2	2	315236	11/8/05	This class is rediculous! Schummer seems like a nice guy but i freaking hate his class. He gives tons of homework (and then never collects it half the time).
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	1	Theology		4	5	1	1	315236	4/20/05	Nice guy, doesn't seem to be all there though. If you take his class, watch his eyes. You know how when cats just stare at a wall for no apparent reason? Thats him every 5 seconds. For his Comp & Crit 111 class, just remember, all poodles are dogs, but not all dogs are poodles. Its a logic thing
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	2	Theology	112	3	4	3	3	315236	2/27/05	He is helpful with papers and will go over things in class numerous times but every hard to grasp maybe teaching style. Late alot! Quiz/Tests are impossible. Nothing makes sense
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	0	Theology		1	1	1	NULL	315236	4/1/04	Thinks he is assigning work for a grad class when he teaches Clares. He is horrible, boring, and really conceited.
St. Bonaventure University	David Schummer	3.0	0	Theology	104	1	2	1	NULL	315236	12/9/03	Absolutely terrible, several long papers, completely unclear in class lectures, tests are very long and very difficult. class is very in depth
St. Bonaventure University	Harry Sedinger	4.2	2	Mathematics	145	5	3	4	3	228123	10/23/10	Awesome teacher! Def. take him if you can. goes over same things for about a week, so you only have to attend once a week to do well in the class. no attendance taken. Funny guy, easy tests & chances for re-takes
St. Bonaventure University	Harry Sedinger	4.2	2	Mathematics	122	4	5	5	4	228123	12/3/08	Sedinger is the man. By for the best teacher at this school. You dont need to buy the book, he doesnt take attendence and he tells the worst jokes. Test are kinda easy and he gives re-takes on any test. Always at my bar.
St. Bonaventure University	Harry Sedinger	4.2	2	Mathematics	122	4	5	3	2	228123	3/18/07	the man

St. Bonaventure University	Harry Sedinger	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	2	228123	1/24/05	Really good guy. Let us bring in papers with formulas and stuff written on them and also gave a take home exam. Not very clear in class but I'm pretty sure he'd be very helpful if you attempted to get help outside of class.

Students willing to actually DO the work, keep up, & come to class are guranteed to succeed with an A or B. Her 10/15/20/25% test grading policy is weird, but I still like her.

You may not love Spanish as much as she loves Bonaventure, but if you contribute in the classroom and show you care about your liberal-arts education, she will respond by giving you an A-. Not too shabby.

Still, he'll often let you out early, and the work level is minimal.

St. Bonaventure University	Stephanie Vogel	3.5	1	Psychology	304	2	3	3	4	222149	12/19/08	I had her for personality class and she was a really good teacher. She is very challenging and you must keep up with the notes. THEN, I decided to take personality LAB with her, and let me tell you it was the worst decision of my life. DO NOT take lab with her. She is not helpful and a horrible grader.
St. Bonaventure University	Stephanie Vogel	3.5	0	Psychology	105	1	1	1	4	222149	3/27/08	I took her for a summer online course. I would highly recommend that you do not take her. She doesn't know how to teach an online course. If you want to put all your effort and interest into this course, and fail, then take her.

St. Bonaventure University	Stephanie Vogel	3.5	2	Psychology	215	2	4	4	4	222149	10/22/06	She's very challenging, but SO worth it because you will actually LEARN in her class. Helpful, nice, and knows her stuff!

This woman is absolutely ridiculous, completely unhelpful and unwilling to elaborate on things. She is unintelligent and cannot complete simple experimental procedures correctly.

St. Bonaventure University	Charles Walker	3.8	2	Psychology	313	5	5	4	3	272748	11/5/09	Great guy! Easy teacher, I have never not gotten an A in his classes. Write a lot for his Reading Reports and you will do fine. For Psych 101 read the book because that is what the tests are on. Save your NQAs and you will get extra credit at the end - he loves extra credit!

He is a good teacher and his classes are semiinteresting. When he offers tests they are challenging... be sure to read the book, but rarely his classes require testing. He also LOVES extra credit... he basically loves giving out A's.

AWFUL
St. Bonaventure University	Allen Weber	2.6	0	Education		3	2	1	NULL	313348	12/8/03	Let's see...he makes it very obvious that he does not like women.

I don't deserve the B- I got in Latin, I did hardly any work at all. But he's such a sweet heart. He's a little soft spoken so sit up front so you can hear him better-and make eye contact. He goes out of his way to call on people who cant even look up from their books (or cell phones).
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics	101	3	5	5	4	173094	11/15/11	His class is extremely helpful. I learned more latin in his class during one semester than i did in three years of high school. if anyone is considering taking latin i highly recommend taking his class.

Fave doc white line "do i have to set myself on fire to get your attention?"
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics	101	4	5	5	4	173094	11/6/07	Even though i'm horrible at Latin i still enjoy going to Prof. White's class hes so nice and is always cracking jokes

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics	103	3	4	5	NULL	173094	11/24/03	I LOVE MYTHOLOGY, which probably helped with my extreme enjoyment of his class. His choices of texts were fabulous, and his knowledge of them was amazing. If you don't like the classics, you might find him boring. But if you like myth, go for it!! ;)

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	0	Classics		4	1	2	1	173094	11/16/10	His classes are terrible. He is boring and half of the time you cannot follow what he is talking about because he is rambling on. He does know his stuff but is terrible at teaching it to the students. He shows up late for class and then expects you to stay late because he couldn't get to class on time. The two classes I took with him were the worst
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics		5	5	5	3	173094	5/26/09	Excellent professor. More than a decade later, I still include some of his myth interpretations in my own lecture nots.

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics		3	4	5	5	173094	5/12/05	Dr. White is a treasure  one of my favorites. The man will never know the influence he had on me. Hes living proof that brilliance need not be pretentious. My love of the ancient began in his class. Rome salutes you Dr. White. I still say gasp from time to time. Go Redneck Zombies From Hell!
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics		5	5	4	4	173094	11/22/04	One of the easiest and best professors I have ever had. He was probably too easy. But he was genuine, knowledgeable, and funny.
St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics		2	3	4	NULL	173094	12/16/03	Great fun, NOT. Not a bad guy, could try more tactics to keep students awake at 8:30 a.m. Still glad I didn't take Dr. Brown, Dr. White is much more interesting.

St. Bonaventure University	Jeff White	4.2	2	Classics		3	5	5	NULL	173094	3/26/03	Doc White...who doesn't love Doc White? The subject matter is typically dry and boring, yet he makes it interesting. It pays to just show up and listen to roll being called. Also, I never got tired of the Euripedes joke.

St. Bonaventure University	Denny Wilkins	4.4	2	Journalism		3	5	5	5	157313	1/15/08	The point of being in college is to LEARN. If your ego is too big to accept a B or C, you don't belong in the JMC program. He's the best professor you'll ever have and no one will help you more along the way. Graduating was depressing because I knew I'd never again sit in his class. The type of person who avoids his class is a worthless journalist
St. Bonaventure University	Denny Wilkins	4.4	2	Journalism		1	4	5	4	157313	10/24/05	Wilkins will do his best to scare the **** out of you. He usually succeeds. His goal is to get the kids who resent thinking out. His "press conferences" may be dificult, but he wants you to be able to use the material given to you. He's a tough grader, but if you see him before you turn in papers, the visit should save you major points. In a sick, twisted way, he wants you to suceed, but wants you to earn it. My proudest B+ ever.
St. Bonaventure University	Denny Wilkins	4.4	2	Journalism		1	5	5	4	157313	2/28/05	I had him a few years ago and he is definitely the man. He's a very hard grader - I scratched and clawed my way to a C+. But then again I could now probably edit circles around the editor of the New York Times. How do you like dem apples?

St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	2	Languages	202	2	5	2	3	476515	5/7/06	Good professor, who wants students to participate in class. He is really smart and one of the best french teacher I have ever had. He knows a lost about French culture and history
St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	2	Languages	201	5	5	5	5	476515	9/9/05	Dr Wood was a great prof. I took several classes with him and always did very well. If your decent in languages there is no reason you can't do well. A Bona grad
St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	2	Languages		3	3	4	4	476515	8/24/05	maybe not the easiest teacher for 200 level but for 400 level courses, he's easy.. talk to him, he's led an interesting life, very cool guy

St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	1	Languages	408	5	3	2	2	476515	10/6/05	the most boring class ever! i have no idea what we gonna have in the test. we didnt have a midterm. we didnt do any homeworks or paper. i dont read the assigned readings. hes very unclear about everything. mumbles a lot. hes a very nice guy and so easy but def not a very good teacher
St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	2	Languages	300	5	5	4	5	476515	8/28/05	Dr Wood is an amazingly intelligent man who sometimes has difficulty communicating with others, but has so much to offer anyone who is willing. I learned more from him in one-on-one conversations and he did so much to help me.
St. Bonaventure University	Paul Wood	3.4	2	Languages	201	3	4	3	1	476515	10/25/04	Easy class if you know your French. He speaks in French way too much and not enough English. Do the workbook in lab and try to understand the in class exercises and you will obtain an A. I havent done any HW but the 3 , 10 sentence compositions and I got an A.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	2	Business	613	5	5	5	5	368945	5/15/10	Class is boring but she is very nice. A lot of exercises rather than lecture. Easy overall.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	2	Business	410	2	5	5	3	368945	5/13/09	Great class! It was very hands on and practical. It is not like other BIS classes like Case taught - this focused on the Internet, mobile commerce, wireless issues, and social issues. I learned a lot and Dr. Young made it very interesting. a good elective too.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	2	Business	410	5	5	5	5	368945	5/31/07	Great teacher, very helpful. One of the best BIS classes I took.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	0	Business		3	1	2	4	368945	12/6/05	I was excited about taking this class until I realized Dr. Young has spent her entire life in a classroom and offers no real world experience aside from "West Wing" references. She also loves to pick favorites and will choose one group to unfairly criticize for the entire semester. Do not take a class with her it is a waste of time and money.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	1	Business	310	5	3	2	1	368945	2/27/05	She is very easy dont go to class unless there is a group project and you will be fine print notes off electronic reserve and you wont even need a notebook or a text book. Easy, Easy, Easy! Make sure you get a good group makes all the difference. MINE SUCKED!!!!
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	1	Business	310	2	3	2	NULL	368945	3/20/04	AWFUL!! Her tests are way out of context. She thinks she knows everything because she is a clinicial pshchologist. She picks a group every semester to rag on and tells them everything they are doing is wrong, even when it's right. Avoid her if you can.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	0	Business	101	2	1	2	4	368945	4/2/10	Took for organizational behavior. very opinionated, picked favorites, and also picked students to put down and degrade for the semester. Petty and immature, but worse taught nothing about class. dropped midway through semester and took over summer at Canisius -BEST DECISION I've EVER MADE. do not take this teacher.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	1	Business	301	4	2	4	5	368945	3/26/09	Online exams. Take notes from powerpoints.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	2	Business		3	5	5	5	368945	5/8/06	Awesome teacher. Great class.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	0	Business	310	3	1	1	5	368945	11/4/05	Dr. Young has no idea as to what she is teaching.She teaches right out of the textbook has no real experience involving computers and is unfairly picky on tests. Dr. Young will be an extreme disappointment to anyone with an interest in computers/technology.
St. Bonaventure University	Kimberly Young	3.0	0	Business	301	1	1	1	2	368945	2/9/05	shes a ****
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		4	5	5	3	92187	12/6/12	She's a great professor! She makes sure that you understand what she teaches and as long as you explain your opinion on what she teaches, you will pass the class. Her exams are pretty easy and straight to the point. As long as you understand what she teaches, which you will, you will pass the course.
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology	208	4	5	4	3	92187	3/31/08	She is the nicest woman. She will do ANYTHING to help you out if you do not understand something. Her tests were all essays but gives you the topics to study for. She is very intelligent and helps change your veiw point :)
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology	413	5	5	5	4	92187	10/19/05	She was great, very clear, helpful, and just a great professor. Her tests were really easy, and I felt that I learned a lot!

St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology	108	5	5	4	NULL	92187	3/26/04	She is intelligent and interesting to listen to. She gives daily quizzes about the previous material. Her voice is a little monotone, but that is the only drawback.
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		4	5	5	NULL	92187	12/8/03	She is a wonderful person in every way. Has a unique way of explaining things and expresses herself extremely well. You will not regret having her for a professor.

St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		3	5	5	5	92187	9/20/05	An amazing professor...Prolly my favorite ever
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		5	5	5	NULL	92187	6/2/04	The best teacher I have ever had. Very intelligent, open-minded, very nice. I took her class on minorities in the US three years ago and she was great, she encourages students to think critically and voice their personal opinions.
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		3	5	5	NULL	92187	12/8/03	She is clear and concise in her lecturing and makes the classes so much more enjoyable!
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology	401	4	5	5	NULL	92187	11/13/03	Forum sucks, but she makes it alot better.
St. Bonaventure University	Kathy Zawicki	4.7	2	Sociology		4	5	5	NULL	92187	2/19/03	Nice lady, very fair, easy to get along with.
St. Bonaventure University	Kayla Zimmer	2.3	2	Education	325	5	4	5	4	92169	6/27/11	She's a very nice person who is absolutely in love with the topic she teaches. She makes a few mistakes, but don't be afraid to point them out to her. There are a lot of pointless assignments and you'll read about 6 books or so in the class, but they're all really easy. Take notes when you read the books for the (online) quizzes!
St. Bonaventure University	Kayla Zimmer	2.3	2	Education		5	3	4	4	92169	3/18/06	I transferred from Bona's, but I will say that Prof Zimmer is a good professor. She was very nice and the class as a whole is an easy A. She was always willing to help and allowed you to correct your papers/tests etc. She's very in tune with what goes on in the EDU world...at least I thought so.
St. Bonaventure University	Kayla Zimmer	2.3	1	Education	201	4	4	2	3	92169	5/18/05	A very nice teacher, and person. Helps you whenever needed. however you doesn't teach well. she expects us to already know stuff.
St. Bonaventure University	Kayla Zimmer	2.3	0	Education		1	1	1	NULL	92169	5/14/03	Likes to teach people how to teach but she has never really taught, except substituting, does that really count? She is not a good teacher at all. Sorry Kayla!!!

St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	371	2	4	4	4	1311867	1/10/11	The nicest teacher in the Bio department. Really wants you to do well. Use slides as a study guide when reading the book and you'll do fine.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	371	3	4	4	5	1311867	11/1/10	Dr Zhang is awesome. Anybody who has trouble in her classes with the amount of help she offers should no longer be a biology major. Just do your work and pay attention in class, and you will be fine.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	102	3	5	3	3	1311867	3/5/10	This is her first year teaching Natty World I think she is doing a great job. She goes by the power points but it is the student's job to review the material and ask questions or else it is impossible to understand the material. If you need help, she will be there for you.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	0	Biology	105	1	1	2	5	1311867	12/10/09	Her exams are very difficult and do not go by the objectives listed in the class manual distributed at the start of the semester. If you're taking the exams in the first the section, the self quizzes will help. She isn't very helpful; she specifically told me to come to her for help last after my textbook, friends, and tutor. Good luck.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	105	1	5	3	3	1311867	10/26/09	She is very nice but goes through a chapter (in a powerpoint) in about two classes and you think you understand it until you take the test. The textbook is extremely helpful in clarifing details, but she will help if you ask very specific questions.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	371	2	5	3	3	1311867	12/24/10	great professor. goes all by her powerpoint slides for exams. don't really have to read the book but it helps because it's a tough class
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	371	2	4	3	4	1311867	10/24/10	Madd nice, but requires studying for exams. She's really helpful, class is all exams
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	1	Biology	105	1	3	3	5	1311867	1/2/10	She gave a manual at the beginning of the semester that said tests would ONLY BE on the objectives. Tests went way beyond objectives and some had broken english. She offers help but when I went to her she accused me of being a bad note taker and was rude to me. She also told me I should be coming to her after my book, notebook, friends, &tutor.
St. Bonaventure University	Xiao-Ning Zhang	3.5	2	Biology	105	2	4	3	4	1311867	11/19/09	Exams have multiple-answer multiple choice. Be prepared to know material in depth, because you will feel like you know it, until you take an exam. Pace in class goes relatively quick for the length of a chapter, but she answers questions as long as you're specific in what you're asking. Her English isn't bad, but is sometimes hard to understand.
