Princeton University	Saul Anton	3.8	2	Languages	207	3	4	4	5	818560	8/25/06	nice guy. hard grader. can sometimes be a little abstract and hard to understand exactly what he's looking for but he'll keep trying to answer your question.
Princeton University	Ali Aslam	2.5	0	Writing	113	2	1	1	4	1526745	4/28/11	Very poor course. It was all fluff, mere jargon, no substance, no analytical reasoning. Good for posers though.
Princeton University	Ali Aslam	2.5	2	Writing	113	2	4	4	3	1526745	1/10/11	Great teacher. Very down to Earth, yet intelligent at the same time. Did a great job stimulating conversation and thought. A little sassy at times (good thing). Take a class with him if you can. He made writing seminar both worthwhile and enjoyable.

Princeton University	Dmitry Beliaev	3.2	0	Mathematics	203	2	3	1	3	813118	2/21/06	If you're good at math, you won't have trouble with what is taught in 203, you'll have trouble with how it's taught. He is just painful to listen to for an entire semester. Do yourself a favor and drop to 201 or 202 if he's teaching. It's just not worth it.
Princeton University	Al Acres	4.7	1	Art History	101	3	3	3	3	336888	3/23/12	Great!
Princeton University	Al Acres	4.7	2	Art History	422	2	5	5	5	336888	10/21/07	Al is an absolutely great professor. His seminar was the most engaging I had at Princeton--and I studied with some of the top people. He is meticulously well-prepared, rigorous, and he really cares about the material he teaches. He also cares about his students. If you have a chance to study with this man, don't miss it. A great teacher!
Princeton University	Al Acres	4.7	2	Art History	219	3	5	5	5	336888	12/11/05	Not only the most helpful, thought-provoking, and friendly professor I've had on a personal level in my life, but an eloquent lecturer who really cares about his students and the material. Whichever school he ends up at will be very, very lucky. He makes me want to continue with my studies and go to graduate school, no doubt about it.
Princeton University	Al Acres	4.7	2	Art History	219	3	5	5	3	336888	4/26/05	Awesome professor. It makes me sad he didn't get tenure.

Princeton University	Al Acres	4.7	2	Art History	446	2	5	5	5	336888	9/4/05	One of the BEST professors on campus. Dynamic, engaging and brilliant. The art history department will not find a better Northern Ren prof and they will regret losing him. Take a class with him while you can!

Princeton University	Gary Bass	4.5	2	Political Science	388	2	5	5	3	311532	11/21/10	Gary Bass is the best lecturer/informational speaker I have ever heard, bar none.

Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	101	2	5	5	2	136441	12/29/09	Beth Bogan made me love economics when I was dreading having to take it. Found her lectures crystal clear and interesting, and she's one of the most approachable professors I've ever had. Ended up taking a lot more econ. One of my absolute favorite profs ever.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	101	2	4	5	3	136441	2/6/09	Took her class 25 years ago at a different school....she is who inspired me to go into economics and finance...
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	0	Economics	101	2	2	2	2	136441	2/9/08	I took her course more than 10 years ago, and I'm still scarred. While she keeps a good front by holding more office hours than most, she doesn't connect with most students. Her lectures are notoriously unstructured, and you'll have a hard time following them if you're a novice. She's well intentioned, but she's not an effective teacher.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	101	3	5	5	4	136441	11/27/06	Clear, but a little dry. Most office hours I've ever seen, from any professor, anywhere. Really cares about students.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics		3	5	5	4	136441	8/14/05	Fantastic teacher. Has the most office hours on campus
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	101	3	5	5	4	136441	1/30/05	While some might describe her lectures as dull, they are right on the mark in terms of what you need to know, and should know, about the subject matter. Makes herself extremely accessible. Very straightforward courses, excellent teaching abilities.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	1	Economics	102	3	3	3	2	136441	11/22/04	One of the most overrated teachers at Princeton. I found her lectures very, very dull.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics		3	5	5	NULL	136441	3/28/04	Weasel your way into her precept (usually friday mornings). She's the best, and she's even more clear during precept than she is during lecture. Also was very open to just talking about ANYTHING over dinner at Forbes. Great sense of humor.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	101	2	4	4	NULL	136441	12/5/03	I didn't go to her office hours, but my friends raved about them. Watch out for her TA's who barely speak English though.
Princeton University	Elizabeth Bogan	4.1	2	Economics	307	2	5	5	5	136441	4/13/10	Love love love Bogan. Favorite Professor of all time. She is seriously smart. Changed my whole outlook in Princeton and after. My thesis was influenced by her love of monetary policy.

Princeton University	Francois Bovon	3.5	2	Theology	360	3	4	3	4	328729	4/7/11	With a subject like Theology there is a mere interest among students.

Princeton University	Mark Buchan	3.9	2	Classics	108	2	5	4	4	575440	3/20/08	If you're looking for a systematic approach to grammar, not the professor for you.

You can get away with not doing translation for class, but the consequence is public humiliation, and you'll get screwed on the final. Overall, actually makes classics interesting

Princeton University	Michal Cadden	3.9	1	Theater	400	2	3	3	5	482271	2/18/13	He seems more amused by his own stories than actually getting into course content. He was just ok.

I did fine in the class, but others suffered.

Princeton University	Michal Cadden	3.9	2	Theater		3	4	4	4	482271	4/20/05	It has been a long time since I've taken Michael Cadden's classes, but I can still say, unequivocally, he is the best professor I've ever had.

Princeton University	Kay Chubbuck	3.2	2	Writing	153	1	5	4	2	470083	10/9/04	Dr. Chubbuck is a wonderful professor, but beware - she is extremely tough (as are most Writing Seminar profs). She is, however, fun in classroom discussions and always willing to help if you ask. She's making me into a better writer!

Princeton University	Larry Danson	3.8	2	English	311	3	5	4	5	213526	1/20/08	When nine a.m. still seemed early to begin the civilized day, I took Larry Danson's Shakespeare II class and enjoyed nearly every minute of it. He's better on the more obscure plays than he is on the famous ones...I'd take his "Troilus and Cressida" lecture before his "King Lear" one. Overall, this is what good college teaching should look like.
Princeton University	Larry Danson	3.8	2	English		4	4	4	5	213526	10/8/05	My advice: take Larry Danson's class immediately, before he's gone. He was a preceptor when he taught my father; I had him as a professor. Both of us had the same impression: the man is brilliant, animated, and hilariously funny. No other professor I've had looks at Shakespeare quite this way -- in all its ribald proletarian simplicity. Take the class. That is all.
Princeton University	Larry Danson	3.8	2	English	129	4	4	5	4	213526	2/23/05	He makes things explicit and tells you what is what without B.S. A very "conscious" lecturer and seminar leader.

Princeton University	Paul Frymer	5.0	2	Political Science	220	5	5	5	5	1448211	4/15/12	Excellent lecturer, and an all around great guy.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	1	5	5	5	556516	4/8/12	Brilliant lecturer. Engages students in a large lecture. Examines both sides to arguments and leaves his personal politics outside the classroom. A wonderful experience.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	3	556516	11/5/07	A must for students who want a real education. The constitutional issues discussed would interest any modern American. This course makes students think with the clarity one should expect to have on leaving college. Professor George is rightly known for his fairness, interest in his students, and his love for lively but respectful debate.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	5	556516	11/5/07	By far one of the best classes I took at Princeton. Professor George does an excellent job of challenging students to articulate both sides of the issue. His classes equipped me with the intellectual tools to critically evaluate controversial issues from all angles.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science		1	5	5	4	556516	11/5/07	Professor George was the best teacher I encountered at Princeton. He led terrific class discussions, and really stretched students to consider alternate points of view.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	3	556516	11/5/07	I suspect that the two hateful comments in this thread weren't written by Princeton students; all the Princeton students I know can express their opinions in a more grownup fashion. Professor George's courses were the two best of my entire time at Princeton. His clarity, civility, and eye-opening insight changed the course of my academic career.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	4	556516	11/5/07	Congenial, deadly brilliant, unassuming, provocative, necessary for a complete Princeton experience. His liberal colleagues have only the highest respect for him and have given him the country's most respected constitutional law chair. 'Nough said.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science		1	4	5	3	556516	2/17/06	As a true-blue liberal, I must say that I LOVED his classes -- what an eye-opener! He's brilliant, probably the best professor I've ever had, and single-handedly impacted my career decisions. Take the course, be prepared to do worse than you might in other classes -- you will definitely benefit.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science		2	4	4	3	556516	1/11/06	One of the best reasons to go here. Intelligent and insightful.

Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	315	1	4	5	4	556516	11/5/07	Professor George's courses on constitutional interpretation and civil liberties are a must for any Princeton student interested in responsible citizenship. I've heard so many people remark that while their personal interests lie outside of politics, George's classes taught them the kind of critical thinking necessary for a democracy to thrive.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	326	2	5	5	3	556516	11/5/07	One of the best classes I had at Princeton. Professor George challenged us to examine our beliefs, no matter what they were. Talented lecturer and excellent material.

Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	4	556516	11/5/07	This is the best professor I ever had.

Switched into his recitation cause he was really challenging and incisive on philosophical background of CL (his points are made with subtlety) - don't expect spoon feeding. Was my single most significant class at Princeton - and I'm in CS/EE! Thanks, Prof. George.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	315	2	5	5	5	556516	6/22/05	I can't believe Robbie George has such a low rating here. Sure his class is hard and he has conservative politics and whatever else, but the man is an ultra-genius. Con Interp was the only lecture I never missed in my four years at Princeton. Prof. George is spellbinding, and the Princeton experience is incomplete without one of his classes.
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	315	1	5	5	5	556516	9/24/05	Best class I've ever taken... also the hardest
Princeton University	Robert George	4.6	2	Political Science	316	2	5	5	5	556516	3/17/05	To the person who criticized Prof. George's teaching ability based upon his authorship of the proposed protection of marriage constitutional amendment: it's 'amendment,' one 'm', not two. Who was your spelling teacher? And, for that matter, your intro to logic prof? Both deserve to be censured.

Princeton University	Doug Goldstein	1.0	0	Writing		1	1	1	4	963417	3/6/07	Completely out of touch with reality. He cannot explain and cannot understand why he can't; he is just unclear about every point he tries to make. He does not cover the different types of writing as the course is supposed to. He so enamored with literary interpretation and minutia, the big picture is lost.
Princeton University	Doug Goldstein	1.0	0	Writing		2	1	1	4	963417	2/5/07	Beyond clueless. Inarticulate, obfuscating. Reduces grades because students can't do what he can't explain. Assignments are boring, repetitive and graded according to some "inner feeling" he has that he keeps to himself.

Princeton University	Hans Halvorson	4.2	2	Philosophy	201	4	5	5	3	428040	8/16/10	Prof. Halvorson is great. If you don't like logic, his intro class will be hard, but that's hardly his fault! He's very clear, open to questions, and always well prepared for lectures. The only downside is that he leans too much towards formal math in his more advanced classes.

Princeton University	Robert Kaster	3.5	0	Classics	341	3	1	2	NULL	199441	11/11/03	He's the country's authority in Latin prose but he is not helpful at all if you meet with him for help.
Princeton University	Daniel Katz	4.5	2	Mathematics	103	3	4	5	4	700437	9/20/06	Daniel is a relatively quiet professor and has a cute way of walking in front of the class. He obviously enjoys his subject and is eager to teach his students. Students in his class learn the material easily, because he is clear and answers any questions a student may have. He lacks a certain flare, at times, but overall is a good professor.
Princeton University	Nicholas Katz	5.0	2	Mathematics	555	1	5	5	5	694124	11/2/06	Excellent introduction to etale cohomology.

Princeton University	Brian Kernighan	4.8	2	Computer Science	109	3	5	5	3	571958	2/20/05	Kernighan's a genius. He's amazingly friendly and clear. He makes computers accessible to the liberal arts brain and makes you want to wake up in the morning.
Princeton University	Brian Kernighan	4.8	2	Computer Science	109	3	5	5	4	571958	4/22/06	This guy is really a gem.

Princeton University	Amaney Jamal	3.7	2	Political Science	364	2	4	4	4	429069	6/14/12	Very enthusiastic about the subject. I disagree strongly with the first comment that she is biased; I felt she lived up to her moderate point of view. Assigned reading on both sides of any given question. Unafraid to express her own views in class, but makes sure to very clearly label them as such.
Princeton University	Amaney Jamal	3.7	0	Political Science	364	4	2	2	5	429069	11/26/05	very bias and too opinionated in lecture courses. i wouldn't call her 'even handed,' and find it surprising that so many people credit her for her moderate point of view - her lectures suggest otherwise. Doran would be a better representation of moderate.
Princeton University	Amaney Jamal	3.7	2	Political Science	364	2	5	5	4	429069	12/27/10	It was a privilege to study under her. Very helpful, informed, considerate, and no, contrary to the previous reviewer, she is not concerned with getting you to like her. An asset to Princeton.

Princeton University	Martin Kern	1.6	1	Ethnic Studies	234	2	2	3	2	852611	5/24/06	He was a pretty energetic teacher, but he wanted everything done his way.
Princeton University	Uli Knoepflemacher	4.0	2	English	335	3	5	4	3	543289	12/6/06	He raises interesting questions in seminar and leads a good discussion on films and reading. Wants the best from you and gives major help on papers to get it--comments all over the papers to show you how to do it yourself next time! Accepts various points of view if backedup.
Princeton University	Uli Knoepflemacher	4.0	2	English	335	3	5	5	3	543289	12/5/05	Awesome lecturer. Great visuals, many his own. He cares about students' succeeding and he will teach you how to write, but, more important, how to read and think about literature. Ask lots of questions--the guy is one of the best read profs in the dept. Loved his courses--took 2. Catch him soon.
Princeton University	Uli Knoepflemacher	4.0	2	English	131	4	5	4	1	543289	12/16/05	I had him for a seminar, and he is long-winded. He's still a great professor, though, caring about the students. So long as you get a chance to go to office hours and/or talk with him one-on-one, it'll be great.
Princeton University	Uli Knoepflemacher	4.0	0	English		2	2	2	4	543289	10/8/05	Professor K. is better by far in lecture classes than he is in seminars -- I took both with him, and left the lecture class with a much better impression than I did the seminar. In small-group settings, he tends to be very long-winded and boring, whereas he's the most animated little gnome you'll ever see in lecture. His illustrations for classroom handouts are always a plus, too! If nothing else, he's a very understanding professor who's incredibly interesting personally. He's definitely worth a shot.

Princeton University	Paul Krugman	2.9	0	Economics	275	3	2	1	3	243005	11/28/08	avoid at all costs. he routinely came to class unprepared, clearly had thought little about what he was to teach that day (much less how), and broadcast the impression that he was showing up only to justify his professor's salary. universities hire people like krugman as "prestige" professors and con't care whether they actually can teach.
Princeton University	Paul Krugman	2.9	0	Economics	101	3	1	1	5	243005	8/6/05	A very disappointing class. Takes the science out of social science. He should stick to an honest presentation of facts and theories. Not good for a science school like Princeton. If I wanted to study Journalism I would have gone to Columbia or Northwestern.

Princeton University	Paul Krugman	2.9	0	Economics	101	1	1	1	5	243005	6/13/05	He's deadwood, not an active researcher. Princeton students deserve more than a newpaper columnist, no matter what are his political beliefs. This was the home of Einstein and krugman is a disgrace to this legacy

She can't be bothered actually to interact with students, and openly expresses her lack of interest in their welfare. How she has managed to keep her position for all these years is beyond me. Stay far, far away at all costs.
Princeton University	Arion Melidonis	5.0	2	Anthropology	105	5	5	5	2	756860	12/13/12	Prof Melidonis' class is a complete cake walk if you care about your grades. Yes you have to come to class and yes you have to keep up with the readings to do well on the test. He really knows the material and is always willing to help students out as long as you are trying to help yourself. A++ PROF!!!
Princeton University	Arion Melidonis	5.0	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	756860	11/15/05	In a word, he rules. He know what up. Besides, he's got the best kung-fu in the department - by far.
Princeton University	Arion Melidonis	5.0	2	Anthropology	202	2	5	5	5	756860	8/24/07	Mr Melidonis is a professor with Swiftian wit and knowledge honed with an osteodontokaratic precision. A better theoretician one could not find on this side of the Mississippi. When you think of Cypress, think of Mr. Melidonis.
Princeton University	Elon Lindenstrauss	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	5	1098382	1/27/08	I had MAT333 and MAT574 and he was my JP advisor. I really like him. He's sometimes a bit unprepared for classes in that he often only goes over the ideas of the proofs he's presenting, and tries to handwave the details. But he knows what he's talking about and generally there's no problem. He is funny but has a somewhat inscrutable sense of humor.
Princeton University	Matthew Lorig	4.5	2	Engineering		3	4	5	3	1624742	10/8/11	Lectures are very clear. Lots of examples. Also, Professor Lorig is very entertaining. He jokes a lot. But, it doesn't distract from the class. Homework solutions could be more clearly written. I'd definitely take another class from Professor Lorig.

Princeton University	Lee Mitchell	4.2	1	English	350	3	1	5	4	813673	2/4/12	Professor is a great lecturer, but enamored with the sound of his own voice. Puts on a good show, but trust me, he could care less about the students in his class. Has bait-and-switched several times by making his seminars into lectures when too many people sign up, and only half the class gets to have him as the preceptor.
Princeton University	Lee Mitchell	4.2	2	English	140	2	5	5	3	813673	2/25/08	I am only about a third of the way through this course, and I am a freshman, but Prof Mitchell is inspirational. My other profs seem shallow by comparison--he really listens to us, and while he's sometimes complicated, there's something mad authentic with him.
Princeton University	Lee Mitchell	4.2	2	English	202	2	5	5	3	813673	11/27/11	he is good

Princeton University	Susan Naquin	3.8	2	History	324	3	5	5	4	197928	5/19/12	Very organized class. The professor is attentive to methodological issues in the history discipline and always listens to student's thoughts.
Princeton University	Susan Naquin	3.8	1	History	324	5	2	3	4	197928	5/10/11	Class super easy. Assignments were not helpful to learning the material. Made us write a wikipedia entry on China without any potentially problematic political statements - almost impossible. Did not know how to answer questions in class and tried to brush them off with commonplace assertions on China.

He's always there to help you with whatever you need. He's not out to get you; he wants you to do well and most of his class does do pretty well. You need to put work into it, but if you study and work with him he will help you succeed.
Princeton University	Sergey Norin	3.2	1	Mathematics	217	2	3	3	4	1329006	6/1/10	Not quite as helpful as in MAT 214. Tended to teach clearly but slowly so textbook use was heavy in order to keep up with the homework assignments, which covered topics not yet taught in class
Princeton University	Sergey Norin	3.2	1	Mathematics	214	2	4	1	4	1329006	11/17/09	Pretty cool person. If you follow what he is doing, he is awesome.
Princeton University	Sergey Norin	3.2	2	Mathematics	214	3	4	4	4	1329006	6/1/10	Relatively clear and approachable as far as math professors go

Princeton University	Daniel Oppenheimer	4.8	2	Psychology	101	3	5	5	5	892598	8/12/10	He is very much interested in the learning of his students and his lectures are by far the most exciting and interesting at Princeton
Princeton University	Daniel Oppenheimer	4.8	2	Psychology	101	3	4	5	5	892598	9/20/06	Mr. Oppenheimer is quite possibly one of the best teachers at Princeton.

Princeton University	Helen Milner	3.0	1	Political Science		3	3	3	4	914286	8/25/07	To help me prep for comprehensive exams, I once asked her whether she'd mind my sitting auditing a large class. She pursed her lips, looked at me incredulously, and said, "Why would I care?" I was so astonished that I just stood there frozen. A great mind. A very personally ambitious academic. But boy, what jawdropping incivility and coldness.

Princeton University	Michael Romalis	2.7	0	Physics		5	1	1	4	467462	10/4/04	A very self centered and arrogant man.

Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	1	Philosophy	203	2	2	4	4	268319	2/1/11	He's a great speaker, to be sure; but he's also something of an intellectual charlatan. A lot of rhetorical bark, little philosophical bite.
Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	2	Philosophy	202	3	3	5	4	268319	11/3/09	By far the best professor I had at Princeton. Gideon Rosen is the most amazing speaker I've ever heard.
Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	2	Philosophy	200	2	3	4	2	268319	1/20/08	As others have said, a brilliant lecturer--he filled the cavernous McCosh 60 with his jumpy energy. Every time he finished a lecture, I would think about switching my major to philosophy. One of the few Princeton professors about whom you can truly say; you get your (parents') money's worth.

Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	4	268319	4/21/05	One of my favorite Princeton professors--a really spell-binding lecturer.
Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	2	Philosophy	203	3	5	5	5	268319	1/4/11	While his lectures are well-known for being some of the best on campus, the one thing that I look forward to when attending class is when he takes his graceful hand and fixes his luscious locks of silvery hair woven with the knowledge of centuries of philosophy and sexual enlightenment. My only regret: I didn't sleep with him. Seriously.
Princeton University	Gideon Rosen	4.2	2	Philosophy	101	3	5	4	4	268319	5/18/09	He taught me nearly 20 years ago at the University of Michigan where he landed a job just after getting his Ph.D. at a ridiculously young age. I can think of few professors whose teaching compared, and his ability to incorporate allusions from his wide reading into lectures was impressive. He also loved to walk campus while reading a book.

Princeton University	Monica Silva	2.5	1	Languages	108	4	2	3	4	1130262	11/19/08	She's a pretty good professor, but make sure you like poems/songs rather than book work. She's really into that. She tells you exactly what you need to know for quizzes/exams because she's a little upset that she doesn't get to make her own materials (the course head does it all). She's a nice person, I just don't like the poem/song style.
Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	2	Philosophy	310	3	3	4	5	273320	5/2/12	Singer is an incredible philosopher. He's not an *incredible* professor, but you can still hear his genius when he speaks. There's a reason this guy basically started the animal rights movement. If this class doesn't revolutionize your moral beliefs and practices, you're probably apathetic or not particularly moral

Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	2	Philosophy	310	3	5	4	3	273320	1/18/06	Singer makes his students break away from tradition, to question existing ideas about right and wrong. Take this class if you're prepared to question your belief system and think for yourself.

Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	2	Philosophy	310	1	5	5	3	273320	2/6/08	Intelligent people admire Singer, and usually agree with Singer, unintelligent people usually dislike him and do not agree with his ideas. I dont mean to personally attack those who do not admire him, but that's what I observe. Professor Singer is the best professor and philosopher I know, and I know and have read quite a few.
Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	2	Philosophy	385	3	5	5	5	273320	9/17/06	He's awesome.
Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	0	Philosophy	310	3	1	2	2	273320	9/4/05	I found Singer's idea to be very interesting, and he to be an obviously intelligent person. At the same time I found his class to be extremely boring. He was very diplomatic in his teaching, which sometimes made me lose interest in class.
Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	2	Philosophy	310	3	5	5	5	273320	4/16/05	Peter Singer has a remarkable honesty when addressing the subject of ethics. He's willing to explicitly come to the conclusions many preceding philosophers only alluded to. His conclusions probably won't sit well with what you were raised to believe but his process is valid and will make you think.
Princeton University	Peter Singer	3.3	0	Philosophy	310	3	2	2	NULL	273320	6/2/04	He is highly overrated. His ideas are pretty radical but you'd never know because he presents them soooo blandly. Don't be fooled by the name...Peter Singer will put you to sleep!

He'd often let class out 45 minutes into a two-hour lecture when he ran out of material. Did not put any serious effort into the class or in getting to know his students. He was always off campus and reaching him personally was nearly impossible. But he does have a famous name.

Princeton University	Andrew Wiles	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	232134	10/21/06	ok for the person who said "he is definitely NOT hot", I don't understand what his looks have to do with his teaching/research ability. This is the academic world, not the "celebrity" world. You don't judge their skills based on their looks. Besides, no matter what people say, the fact is, he's the best mathematician of the century!

Princeton University	Tamsen Wolff	3.6	2	English	347	2	5	5	4	105956	7/21/10	If you don't fall in love with plays (or her) you're crazy.
Princeton University	Tamsen Wolff	3.6	0	English	347	5	1	1	5	105956	5/20/08	She is overrated in every possible sense. Hottest in the ivy league (you gotta be kidding!) If we want to be in a class where the teacher shamelessly panders to musical theater geeks then take this class. The fact that she got tenure at Princeton is staggering and as utterly incomprehensible and nonsensical as her lectures, which she works hard

Princeton University	David Wood	3.5	0	Engineering	245	3	2	2	2	869860	5/11/08	He's...not that great. His stories are interesting but completely tangential, and you probably won't learn any of the material from them.
Princeton University	David Wood	3.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	3	869860	7/28/06	He's the smartest man I've ever known, and really knows how to teach- I learned more in this class than any other. He wants you to succeed and you have to study for him, but his tests are fair. Wish I could have more of his classes or be in his group.
Princeton University	Nancy Watterson	5.0	2	Writing	101	2	5	5	3	569236	5/9/09	Nancy Watterson is one of the greatest teachers I had in college. However, she is now at Cabrini, not at Princeton.
Princeton University	Nancy Watterson	5.0	2	Writing	145	4	5	5	3	569236	2/12/05	Dr. Watterson is an extremely dedicated teacher and a very kind person.
Princeton University	Nancy Watterson	5.0	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	569236	8/22/07	She is a great instructor. I was never confident as a writer until I took her class. Extremely helpful. It is worth taking her class she can improve the way you write. I was in her class at Harvard, I noticed her name on the site and I had to recommend her.
Princeton University	Ruth Helen Webb	5.0	2	Classics	300	3	5	5	5	594096	8/31/05	Intelligent, insightful, perceptive, and kind.
Princeton University	Fiorenza Weinapple	4.5	2	Languages		3	5	4	3	651847	8/29/05	I adore Fiorenza. Hilarious, slightly nuts, and a really good lady at heart. Learned a ton and had a blast. Don't be intimidated by her hard-hearted act on the first day of class. She's GREAT.

Princeton University	Benjamin Widiss	4.8	2	English	370	2	5	5	3	551100	7/29/12	In addition to being one of the most challenging and engaging professors I've ever had, BW is also perhaps the kindest individual I've ever met.He's genuinely interested in what you have to say and in helping you to say it more clearly. He understands the social dynamics of the classroom and university. And...have to say it: I effing love that man.
Princeton University	Benjamin Widiss	4.8	2	English	363	1	5	5	5	551100	11/26/08	Prof. Widiss is engaging, curious, witty, eloquent, insightful and a pleasure to have. As others have noted, I had never before worked so hard on my writing nor spent so much time and focused energy on the readings, but I also never had had such a wonderful literature professor.
Princeton University	Benjamin Widiss	4.8	2	English		1	5	5	5	551100	10/9/05	Benj is, without question, one of the best professors of anything I have ever had. I worked harder in his class than in any other class I took at Princeton, but I also discovered my JP and thesis topics/life's passion there (which is something I could never have done by simply reading the material on my own -- it required a lot of guidance). He is a bold and brilliant scholar who is way ahead of the game in his still-developing field (post-modern American literature). I can't recommend him highly enough.
Princeton University	Benjamin Widiss	4.8	2	English	351	2	5	4	3	551100	10/1/09	If you're like me you just Googled B.W. at 2am because he changed how you read books (talk to him on textuality in Z. Smith). Changed how you watch film (see South Park with him sometime and bring up authorial intent.) I'm approaching 350 characters, so I'll close thus: Take as many classes as you can with this guy. I wish I'd taken more. -PU06
Princeton University	Benjamin Widiss	4.8	2	English		4	5	5	3	551100	1/26/06	Professor Widiss is unbelievable. He's so engaging- he works hard in lecture and expects you to work hard in precept. He's genuine and interested in his students (and he gets cute & flustered sometimes). He pushes hard but it's worth it. If he can get me to understand Faulkner, he can teach anyone. Genius.

Princeton University	Susan Wolfson	2.6	2	English		3	5	4	4	223944	7/12/06	Very intelligent, very knowledgeable, very motivated. She is a very fun and very nice teacher if you make the effort to get to know her as I was able to during my seminar with her last fall.

Princeton University	Susan Wolfson	2.6	0	English	315	3	2	2	5	223944	4/14/06	She's frankly not that interesting, but very enthusiastic.
Princeton University	Susan Wolfson	2.6	0	English	201	2	1	3	1	223944	10/9/05	One of the most boring professors of all time. She obviously stays up all night thinking up "jokes" about very un-funny literature, and they fall like bricks every time. Her lectures are grating and duller than dirt. Don't bother.
Princeton University	Michael Wood	4.8	2	English	206	4	5	4	5	794814	8/16/11	Fantastic.
Princeton University	Michael Wood	4.8	2	English	302	3	5	5	4	794814	1/8/06	Can't say enough good things about this man...he's simply amazing. Has fantastic taste in literature, and his lectures are wonderful--always interesting and insightful. Great sense of humor, too.
Princeton University	Michael Wood	4.8	2	English	341	4	5	5	4	794814	9/16/07	Excellent professor, excellent advisor. Can sometimes be difficult to contact, but every meeting is worthwhile. Brilliant!
Princeton University	Cagan  Yalama	4.8	2	Engineering	246	4	5	4	4	1793488	3/28/13	I took his Thermodynamics course which was easier than I predicted. He knows a lot about everything but his tests are kinda hard. He doesnt take attendance so come and go as you please
Princeton University	Cagan  Yalama	4.8	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1793488	1/18/13	This is my second time taking Physics, and his class was much more informative and easier to understand. I wish I had him last year.
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		4	5	5	3	1364631	3/29/13	Excellent teacher. Very, very helpful lessons for non native speakers. I feel lucky having had the opportunity to attend his lessons. The handout is well done. No one yawn during the two-and-half-hours lesson.
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		4	5	4	5	1364631	2/17/12	I love this class. With only 4 classes I feel comfortable enough to read in English. A couple times speaks fast and I can't follow, but it's already amazing.
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		4	5	4	5	1364631	1/3/12	I love his class. The grammar and vocabulary are very helpful. I would prefer if the reading could be commented in class instead of only read. The bloopers are great!!
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages	100	3	5	5	4	1364631	9/19/11	About TEOFL and regular English class: Extremely interested person, has great knowledge about world, language, American way of living, awesome teacher who can provide information, news and like no one raise interest level prior to attending to his English class!!
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		5	5	5	4	1364631	12/6/09	I'm very impressed by his knowledge and enthusiam. His lecture is not only interesting but also very helpful. I'm very lucky to be his student.
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		5	4	4	4	1364631	2/17/12	Even though this was my first class, I learnt a lot and I love the way the class goes. But i would also prefer more individual reading and conversation so that i have enough practice to speak english which is where I have most of the problem.
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	1364631	1/6/12	Eventhough today was my first class I can say he is a great teacher. One of the best english class I´ve ever attended. He really cares about the material and you can tell he really enjoys what he does. So good to have found his class!
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages	101	4	5	5	4	1364631	11/2/11	Exceptionally committed to the class, you can tell he absolutely loves his class. Highly recommended for anyone who has the option to attend, an entirely worthwhile and enlightening experience!
Princeton University	Brian Zack	4.7	2	Languages		3	5	4	4	1364631	1/4/10	I'm happy with your new vocabulary book, but I like also the other one with the pictures. I think you could alternate them. To do both is surely too much vocabulary for me!

Princeton University	Ed Zschau	3.7	0	Engineering	491	5	1	1	5	416089	8/25/05	its the most stupid class I took in Princeton.
Princeton University	Ed Zschau	3.7	2	Engineering	491	3	5	5	NULL	416089	5/27/04	Ed Zschau, former congressman and one of the leaders in the tech boom, is the most amazing teacher you will ever encounter. Do not graduate from Princeton without taking his class.
