Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Ackerman	4.4	1	Freshman Year Experience		4	3	3	1	558062	8/18/05	She makes you feel like you're back in grammar school. The class has useless and boring activities and she makes the class even worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Ackerman	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	558062	1/30/05	Communicated well with the class. Had a good sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Ackerman	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	558062	8/30/05	This class is a joke, but she does her job well for how much of a joke it is, really nice lady and very helpful if you talk to her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Ackerman	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		3	4	4	1	558062	5/12/05	On top of the fact that FYE is a total waste of time, she's really boring and she likes to treat the class like an elementary one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	485	1	5	5	5	738137	2/12/13	Extremely difficult class, but the man is a genius. Always clear explanations, he pushes your mind very hard, doesnt jsut give you reworded problems from class on the exam like most teachers. He fits the grades to a roughly normal distribution (I got a 33% on midterm which he called a C). Would recommend IF you arent taking any other hard classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	3	738137	2/29/12	Great lecturer really enjoyed attending his class and he's a nice guy. Tests are extremely hard though and i'm not sure if he curves
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	4	3	5	738137	1/30/12	Tests are extremely difficult. The average on the first exam was a 47. Homework is lengthy, but it's not assigned every week. Quizzes are also difficult. However, he tries his best to give the best grade possible and he sincerely wants to help students. Take him if you want a challenge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	738137	5/6/11	Awesome teacher. The material is hard, but he'll do everything in his power to help you. At my class's request he made and gave us more quizzes(for more points) and in class work sheets. He's entertaining too! He can be brash if he thinks you aren't doing your part to learn, but overall, a great teacher. By far my best college professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	1	Mathematics	283	2	3	3	3	738137	11/16/09	This class is extremely hard! I actually dropped the class, he expects you to devote your life to the class. His homework takes hours to do and is only 5% of the grade. It is a complete waste of time. I agree he is funny but he expects way to much from you so unless you are a math major, I recommend getting out!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	283	1	4	3	3	738137	10/8/09	Difficult, but a nice enough person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	738137	11/10/08	VERY VERY HELPFUL, VERY SMART and extremely orgranised in his teachings and really clear to understand. You have to do your part and take interest, if you speak up in class, he will clearly explain anything. Highly reccomend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	331	2	5	5	5	738137	11/25/07	Agarwal is amazing. Everybody should have him at least once. He is extremely challenging, and it's very very hard to get an A, but you will definitely learn the material if you go to lecture. He is magical at helping you understand even the hardest material. I recommend him to everybody.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	738137	1/15/07	The ratings do not give this professor justice. He was actual quite clear in lectures, but I fail to give him a good rating there because he was so poor elsewhere. The main area of concern is his grading policy. He marks points off for the most arbitrary and idiotic reasons.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	738137	8/8/06	Class material can be challenging, but Agarwal is a good teacher. He is willing to help too, although he was late to his office hours almost every time I went to see him - I assume it was out of his control though, he is a busy man. Again, be prepared to work if you take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	432	1	3	5	2	738137	10/16/12	Had to drop this class. Very nice man, very clear on his expectations, they are wildly high. Workload is not unreasonable either, but his tests are impossible. Must be a very conceptual thinker. Not getting through on partial credit, if that's what you're used to. Some things to consider before taking his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	5	738137	2/26/12	He is great at teaching the concepts but gives very hard exams and quizzes. If you like calc and want a challenge then take him, if not take a different professor. Very easy to get a B in his class very difficult to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	0	Mathematics	281	1	2	1	4	738137	1/26/12	Very hard grader, ver unforgiving. I got a D in the class, while many other of my friends got F's. He DOES teach you pretty well and you seem to know the material, but it will be very difficult. One problem he would have with teaching is that he would show you a problem, ask for what you THINK might be the answer, and then never telling you it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	331	1	5	5	2	738137	8/5/10	Difficult class, he expects a lot from you. Homework is hard, exams are hard, but he curves everyone's final grade. He is an extremely good teacher, and explains things VERY clearly. I swear, this man is magical. Attend and pay attention in his class or you'll be really screwed, because your friends wont be able to explain it even half as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	283	1	5	4	4	738137	11/12/09	Very Difficult class, but he's very funny and makes sure you know what's going on at all times. If it seems like a lot of the class is confused he'll go back and try to help you understand. He takes the Idea of Project based Calc seriously, there is really a project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics	531	1	4	5	4	738137	4/20/09	Hard professor, keeps you busy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	1	Mathematics	273	1	3	2	3	738137	4/27/08	HW is very hard, quized are extremely hard, exams are harder still. I got a B in his Discrete I that I was sure I was going to fail, probably because everyone else did so badly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	738137	1/31/07	My favorite professor so far. Really gets you interested in the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	2	738137	1/12/07	Good prof. You have to be in class, if you miss something you're way behind. Material is challenging as is the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	738137	2/9/06	Professor Agarwal is a great teacher. He really knows his stuff. He explains things clearly, and he encourages questions and class participation. But don't be fooled. If you accidentally miss something he says, it is VERY difficult to try to relearn it from the book. But he is always happy to help his students succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	1	Mathematics	265	2	2	3	3	738137	2/6/06	The book is no help at all, and I hated his teaching style. If you have him for discrete, it's not like calc, it's extremely hard to teach yourself the material after he's taught it. If his teaching style doesn't suit you, you're screwed. His quizes/tests are also hard as heck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	738137	12/1/05	Disliked his class a lot... and wasnt very helpful in my class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	738137	10/26/05	This guy really knows his stuf. He gets the students involved in class and keeps it... as interesting as calc can be. Handwriting is ALWAYS perfect, and speaks clearly, his accent is nothing short of 'freakin' awesome'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	738137	12/16/05	Very good teacher. He knew the material, usually kept every involved, explained it clearly, and had flawless handwriting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anurag Agarwal	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	738137	11/29/05	good teacher...one of the best i've had so far..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering	404	3	5	5	4	755451	2/28/10	Great teacher. Good upfront explanation and schedule. Had some funny stories of people he knew from his industrial days.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	755451	2/1/10	He's a HORRIBLE teacher. He doesn't really speak English. Asking him a question will just be a waste of time. Really upset I had to pay for his class and teach myself calc. Also, the homework is entry level stuff and then he puts crazy advanced problems on the test with advanced math rules never/ briefly mentioned ever in class. AVOID AT ALL COST!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering	214	3	4	4	3	755451	10/27/09	extremely friendly, answers questions you ask, material is difficult but manageable, good sense of humor, class goes by quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering	440	3	4	4	3	755451	5/9/08	His class was pretty difficult but he was a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	755451	3/4/08	Inconsistent grading, even more inconsistent teaching, cant understand a word of what he says if you dont know MATLAB. This dude is crazy about integrating MATLAB into all his courses. Strictly avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering	440	4	5	4	2	755451	4/28/07	This guy is good. If you show up to class and follow his notes, which he posts online, no reason you shouldn't get an A. 1 weekly homework and he basically does the entire assignment for you online. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering		5	3	1	2	755451	12/6/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering		2	2	1	3	755451	11/13/05	He is the worst teacher I have ever had. He does not have a consistent grading system. He does not explain ahead of time what to do to get full credit. Every homework and test was a literally a learning experience about his grading system. Fortunately, he does throw his notes onto his website. Avoid him if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering		4	4	3	4	755451	2/14/10	A good professor. Will try everything to make you understand the topic and get you to the same level as everyone else in the class. Easy A, just do all the homework on time and make sure you pay attention in class... And he tries his level best to now fail anyone or not even get a bad grade.. He makes sure you progress... Recommended!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering		4	2	2	4	755451	2/1/10	could use some help in getting his ideas across as his material is very tough to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering	885	2	2	1	4	755451	10/8/08	wierd...knows his crap seems like a grouch somehow it kinda clicks for most people but it seems like most end up hating him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	1	Engineering		2	3	2	2	755451	4/29/08	He's a good guy...he'll help you if you ask and he just wants you to learn the material...He's also not out to fail you. Only thing bad I can say is that his test are a little long, but whatever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering	865	2	1	2	4	755451	2/14/08	Gives good notes online but not very welcoming to questions. Taken this class at a different school and had a much better experience. Sometimes WAY too theoretical.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	0	Engineering	440	2	1	3	4	755451	12/9/06	I agree with the inconsistent grading comments. However, this is only an issue if you don't know the material. Dr A. tests on the course material, plus the background material, which is fair isnt it? He was always helpful outside of class, plus, he usually adds a huge curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Agbezuge	2.7	2	Engineering	440	3	4	4	3	755451	9/13/06	Dr. Agbezuge does a good job teaching the tools needed to solve all problems. The key to the class is paying attention and learning the theory behind each equation and method. Notes, example tests and code for the homework are provided on the course website.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	4	803927	1/30/13	WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD!!! Its easy to get used to his accent but is impossible to understand what hes teaching. All he does is write stuff on the board and mumbles towards the board while he writes! In class the material looks easy, in the homework the material is ok, then in the test is ridiculous! If you ask for help, will barely give it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	803927	1/28/13	Fantastic professor. Very concise, knows his stuff, and makes sure everyone in his class learns it too. Plus he has a really great accent. Definitely recommended to anyone to wants to really learn math. Really stresses the "understand, not memorize" idea of teaching. Best professor I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	1	803927	2/27/12	Good teacher, nice guy. Has quite the accent but you can definitely get used to it. In fact, it helped me pay attention and found it kind of amusing at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	305	3	5	5	4	803927	2/16/12	Great professor all around. He can be a little hard to understand at first but after the first two classes there were no problems. He is really helpful in office hours and goes the extra mile to help you understand the material. He gives practice exams before each test and the questions are very similar to each other. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	1	803927	11/21/11	Very reasonable when grading. Second test was very hard but he dropped your two worst questions. Final was take home. No book required. HW was usually 1 question. Told jokes in the middle of his lectures. Very helpful and clear. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	283	4	3	4	4	803927	8/20/10	Gets the job done. Takes a week or so to get use to his accent. His homework and workshop assignments really help you learn the material. If you pay attention in his class, the homeworks and quizzes and easy. His exams are very thorough but doable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	4	4	803927	12/2/09	Great Professor, Tends to get into the long way to do something just to show how it works, but by the end of his class you will be ready for the test or quiz. Workshops are incredibly helpful in learning material. He is a fair grader and homework assignments are free points. I would recommend his class for anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	1	Mathematics		4	2	4	5	803927	10/21/09	Very hot. He is a great professor. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	306	3	4	3	4	803927	4/28/09	Very good teacher who explains things clearly. He has an accent, but you'll get used to it. I had him for Calc II and decided to take Diff Eq with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	282	5	4	4	4	803927	11/26/08	Agyngi was a great teacher. He made everything really clear and never assumed the class knew anything, which sometimes caused boring classes, but was overall a good thing. He occasionally tried to tell a joke, but he always cracked up in the middle of it, which made it that much more funny. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	3	803927	1/30/13	Assumed we already knew calculus
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	2	803927	10/12/12	Very good teacher. Clearly explains all the topics. Final exam was a take-home and he will curve the tests a lot depending on how the class does.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	803927	2/27/12	He's a good professor overall. It's a challenging course due to the amount of material that has to be covered in the amount of time given, but he did a good job explaining the concepts and answering questions. He also structured the grading so that the class is a bit easier. The final only covers the last 1/3 of the class, not the whole class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		2	3	4	4	803927	1/26/12	Really not my style. Gave homework right before the test and had the test cover material not on the homework. If you learn fast pace he's right for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	1	Mathematics	281	2	2	3	1	803927	1/30/11	our class was s.o.l. our TA could only be there for the first hour so for about 6 weeks we had the lab before we actually learned the material and he didn't understand why we didn't get it. He also doesn't really cover examples and only teaches concepts so hope thats your learning style! (because it's not mine)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	282	3	4	4	3	803927	1/13/10	I don't think he was a particularly good or bad professor. He gets the job done. He has an accent that takes a week or two to get used to. He is thorough in his teaching. His grading is fair. There is a quiz every week and labs two out of three days of the week which are helpful for learning the material and cushioning your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	5	803927	10/25/09	A pretty good professor. His explanations are long and sometimes he skips steps but hes a very approachable guy. Quizzes every week but those are easy. His exams arn't too bad either just do the workshops and you will probably get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	5	5	803927	5/19/09	BEST MATH PROFESSOR EVER. i highly recommend him to any student that wants to actually learn the material and do good in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	803927	4/21/09	Great Calc Professor, would recommend to anyone. Teaching was phenomenal.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	1	803927	10/8/08	Hard to understand the first week, but you get used to it quickly. He's reserved most of the time, but occasionally opens up with some stupid math joke. Class was easy and had a reasonable amount of homework, all online. Doesn't always explain something, but very helpful when asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	3	803927	12/16/07	Professor Agyingi is great!!! He is really fair and if you want to learn math take him. His accent is sometimes hard to understand but you get used to it. He will also occasionally tell a joke and even though most of them are not funny its great to see him try. Math is boring and no teacher is going to make it exciting but Agyingi makes it so beara
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	3	4	3	803927	5/30/07	I had him last year and decided to take him again this quarter for Diff EQ for Engineering Techs. He teaches this class pretty much the same as his previous classes. Show up, take notes, do your homework, get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	304	3	5	3	2	803927	4/30/07	Nice guy who helps you when you go for office hours. Funny when he tries to say the word sheet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics	271	4	4	4	3	803927	10/26/06	By far the best calc teacher I have had in college. He knows his stuff, really friendly, and he can teach. His accent is not a problem after the first few weks. Very fair grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	803927	1/25/06	Dr. Ephraim Agyingi is the greatest calc teacher I've ever had. He's knowledgable, helpful, funny and stylish to the max. Just look at those shoes! Plus his random stories and jokes make getting up for his class totally worthwhile. And remember, "attendance is compulsory."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	3	803927	11/7/07	Great guy and an awesome teacher. He is strict when it comes to getting homework done, but is lenient on grading. He does have an accent, but it's not hard to understand him. I learned a lot from this guy, be sure to take him, he's better than a lot of calculus teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	803927	5/9/07	Don not take this teacher, unles you dont speak english, he always stands in front of what he writes on the board, and you can barley understand his broken english, went from an a in calc 1 to barely a c in calc 2
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	3	803927	3/5/07	Hard class for me. He has a strong accent and assumes that you have calculus knowledge. I didn't realize how badly he taught calc till I took calc B with a better (and more clear) teacher. Take him only if you have taken calc before else find another professor that teaches with more clarity. Tests are tricky.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ephraim Agyingi	3.7	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	3	803927	10/23/06	Took for calculus A. I'm not good at math so his class was hard to follow. For those with no calculus experience, be careful. His heavy accent and tendancy to speed through problems/notes makes it hard for us that aren't math geniuses to keep up at times. Homework and groupwork grades (20%) will be your saving grace if you blow at math like I do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	0	Information Technology		4	1	1	1	1348829	5/8/12	Yells at students, frequently loses train of thought, unhelpful in lab. Tests and quizzes have incomprehensible and misspelled questions. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	0	Information Technology	413	1	1	1	1	1348829	2/27/10	Useless lab professor for wireless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	1	Information Technology		3	4	2	4	1348829	11/30/09	Good Guy but a little hard to understand. Monotone voice put me to sleep sometimes but he was always there to help out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	0	Information Technology	413	3	1	1	4	1348829	11/16/11	Do not take his class. During the labs he seems to not know what he is doing. Gets mad when students do not ask any questions. But doesn?t answer the questions that are asked. Take wireless with any one else, NOT HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	0	Information Technology	221	3	2	1	2	1348829	1/26/10	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yamin Al-Mousa	1.4	0	Information Technology	220	3	1	1	2	1348829	11/3/09	Doesn't speak English very well, is very unclear in his lectures, and gets very upset when you get one of his in-class questions wrong. Very boring. Not helpful. When asked a question, he usually just repeats the last thing he said. Also gets very upset if no one has any questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Alan	4.2	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	5	321031	9/2/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Alan	4.2	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	NULL	321031	5/6/04	The only class that I have had where I actually learned something and improved. Good teacher, but only one class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Aldersley	5.0	2	English		5	5	5	5	640825	1/24/11	Very clear and worth to have him while maintaining your reading/writing skills. He makes the assignments very fair. I'd reccomend you this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		3	5	4	4	1127966	2/2/12	He's a good professor and nice person but he's late with grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		1	4	5	4	1127966	1/31/12	Ali Ali is great at what he does and anyone who has him as a professor should recognize that and take it upon themselves to learn something from him. He's not going to just give you the answers because you won't learn that way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		2	4	4	3	1127966	1/5/11	Most anyone who thinks Ali is awful is simply not prepared for the workload that NMD gives. Ali is fair and will be a great help to you as long as you're willing to try and show some effort. I learned plenty from his classes and he always made me laugh, and he was great prep before getting in to my junior level classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		2	5	4	5	1127966	5/12/10	This man gave me nightmares for months. However, he was my first introduction to flash and I learned to love it intensely. He will work you hard and demand all your time and attention but he is just preparing you for Adam and Jason. If you prove to him in this class that you are worthy, he is actually a really cool guy. ps. Don't Panic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		1	1	1	3	1127966	2/3/10	The only people that give this guy a good rating are people that knew how to use Flash before his class. And I don't think I saw one person complain about the workload he gave us, just about his ability to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design	101	2	4	5	4	1127966	1/27/10	Ali is excellent and he knows his stuff, and don't be dissuaded by his sarcasm; he's actually a pretty nice guy. His class is the closest thing you'll have to the workload you can expect from NMD. But if you're complaining about work he gives you now, you should probably switch to GD before you hit your first class with Adam and Jason.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design	411	2	2	1	3	1127966	4/26/09	He did not understand Flash CS4 before teaching the class; each class would take extra time for him to figure out the interface. Lectures were painful, and he did not let you work while he was speaking, so it was impossible to follow. Principles of animation mean NOTHING if he doesn't teach you how to do them. You will teach yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		2	4	5	5	1127966	5/1/08	Ali is funny but can be brutally honest if you dont do your projects well. He gives really helpful feedback and knows what he's talking about. If you put effort into your work he will give you an A. He never wastes your time with busy work or filler class: if you understand the material you can usually leave early. I learned a lot from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		4	5	5	5	1127966	2/2/12	He's an amazing teacher! I learned a lot from his class. Totally he knows what he's talking about. I recommend him for Flash.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	2	Design		2	5	5	4	1127966	1/21/11	It's been four years since I had him but I'm back to comment because he is such a good professor! He is blunt and doesn't put up with terrible work but he is also sarcastically funny (which is hilarious). If you want to be anywhere near a good designer when you graduate then take his courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		1	1	1	4	1127966	10/31/10	Ali Ali is the worst teacher I have EVER had. This includes high school. I have a lot of Photoshop experience in the past so the class wasn't too tough for me, but he was horrible at teaching his subject matter. Sits behind his laptop, completely unapproachable. Gets angry when students dont make masterpieces, & his "constructive criticism" isn't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		1	1	1	1	1127966	2/27/10	I had a lot of problems with his teaching style(all the same problems as the previous comments), but he ended up being really lenient with final grades. I ended up with 2 letter grades higher than I was expecting. I wonder, though, if he just felt bad for being a crappy teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		2	1	2	3	1127966	2/2/10	Ali knows what he is doing in Flash (but not with AS3.0), and because he is so good he forgets we haven't used this program before and goes really fast. He won't let you follow along when he is doing the labs, and if you ask a question he gets mad. He also doesn't give you grades until the end so you have no idea how you are doing in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		1	1	2	1	1127966	1/27/10	I've heard people say they like him..I just don't see it. He spends 5 minutes on a lecture then expects you to be a pro. Completely unapproachable when you need help - gets mad/annoyed when students don't understand his awful teaching. Hands down you will have to teach yourself. Horrible 1st experience w/animation. My entire class hated him. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ali Ali	3.0	0	Design		1	1	1	5	1127966	2/3/09	He explains what to do from the back of his room on his little computer, but you are not allowed to touch your computer as he teaches you the new software. When he is done explaining you have the rest of the class to do everything he did precisely step by step. If you mess up a little on flash you mess the entire animation up. If you have a problem
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessie Allen	4.3	2	English		3	5	4	4	948781	1/27/08	Hard Professor, but learned a lot. She gives you the grade you deserve. If I had another writing class, would definitely take it with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessie Allen	4.3	2	English		2	4	4	4	948781	2/5/07	Well, she is not an easy professor. Late assignments not accepted. She may not be easy, but I have taken one other writing class so far and have learned a lot more out of her class. If you want to learn better writing techniques take her class, otherwise run!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessie Allen	4.3	2	English	227	3	4	5	3	948781	2/7/07	Very good teacher. I did not like writing before I took this class; I always dreaded the two page papers that other teachers would give me. After taking this course the two page papers are a sinch and now I actually like writing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sam Abrams	4.2	2	Literature	451	4	5	4	4	679701	11/25/06	Sam is an experience. He's old and has no qualms about discussing his younger years, which apparently were drowned in a glorious cloud of smoke. It has claimed many of his brain cells, leaving his students with a raw, genuine lover of poetry, jazz music, and beer. I loved his class, and actually learned quite a bit. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sam Abrams	4.2	2	Literature		3	5	5	5	679701	9/22/05	Sam Kicks ASS. Great fiery attitude. A pleasure to take a class from him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sam Abrams	4.2	1	Literature		3	3	3	3	679701	10/26/05	Great, as long as you like liberals.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sanghmitra Agarwal	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	3	1042339	10/23/07	It was my first time in a calculus class so it was kind of hard, Agarwal is not the most helpful which didn't help at all. but honestly are there any GOOD math teachers???
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	211	5	4	4	1	559806	2/10/13	Easy tests, boring lectures. No real need to show up to class - just use SparkNotes and listen to him answering questions before the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	210	5	5	5	4	559806	2/6/10	Amazing class. Extremely interesting, really gets you involved in thinking about the material. All you have to do is read, show up and take decent notes, and you'll do great. Four in-class tests count for 100% of grade. Tests are 2 essays. I wrote 1-1.5 pages each essay. Reviews material directly before test. Easy A for me. Had an average above 98
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	211	5	5	5	5	559806	12/12/07	I'm not much of a philosophy person but he made it very easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		5	4	4	4	559806	6/16/07	Very easy professor. Lectures are thought-provoking, and he tries to make the material clearer by using real world examples. He does tend to repeat himself quite a bit though. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	3	559806	5/1/07	He is a fantastic teacher, great at explaining things and making you understand them. He quotes the book often so it's good to at least skim through it. His lectures are the whole tests, but they are very easy anyway. He also has a review for the test right before you take it. Overall, take him if you have the chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	559806	2/13/06	Good teacher, although he had to try and handle a large class of about 70 students which sometimes proved to be cumbersome for him. He is a good teacher and fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	4	3	559806	5/7/05	Only thing that held him back was stupid questions from students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	203	5	5	5	5	559806	2/14/11	Ignore the idiots that rated this guy a 1. This is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Crystal clear, easy grader, passionate (and extremely knowledgeable) about his field. I wholeheartedly recommend his class if you care at all about philosophy. Easy A if you pay attention and learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	0	Philosophy		2	1	1	1	559806	10/29/09	I didn't like the how he teaches his classes. I respect that. I always fall asleep when I come to his classes. If you want to actually learn, then go ahead take his class. As for me, I was just looking for a LA class to fill up. Big mistake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	4	559806	11/1/07	Very interesting class. He's a really good teacher. Not tested on text, tested on lecture, but he refers to quotes. 4 exams no final. No papers. No projects. Take notes, study notes you'll do great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	3	559806	5/14/07	Great lecturer. Just show up, listen about 50% time, easy. no final, 4 exams total. very fair questions on exams. draws funny little doodles to help visualize scenarios. highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	210	4	5	5	4	559806	11/21/06	great professor! very nice and keeps the class interesting... can tell he is interested in what he is teaching. fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	4	3	559806	2/9/06	This guy is the man. I highly recommend this class, it's an easy grade. He fully describes all topics and there are four tests for the quarter, all in essay form. Very fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aguilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	3	559806	1/23/05	All readings are printed out for you, very clearly covers topics. Tests are all essay. Fair grader. I would recommend for anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ijaz Ahmed	3.2	1	Chemistry	300	2	2	3	2	1217964	11/12/09	He's a good TA, he just grades ridiculously hard. I'm pretty sure the class average for the lab was a C... awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ijaz Ahmed	3.2	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	4	1217964	12/1/08	Ijaz is great and a fair and easy grader, take him for lab!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing		5	5	5	4	1629491	5/29/12	Very intelligent. Class was very interesting. Funny guy. One of the best professors I have had. Take his class. He is very current and up to date with his lectures. Knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	571	5	5	5	5	1629491	4/18/12	I took Internet Marketing with him in the winter quarter. I loved the class. I learned a lot especially how to do search engine optimization and how to use social media for marketing. Very funny and approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	571	5	5	5	5	1629491	4/5/12	Excellent knowledge. Very focused to the real world. You need to participate in class discussion. Overall very good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	571	5	5	5	5	1629491	2/15/12	Good professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	571	5	5	5	5	1629491	1/31/12	Best professor .Great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	363	5	5	5	4	1629491	12/8/11	Take his class without any hesitation. He is one of the best professors in RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing		5	4	5	3	1629491	5/18/12	Clearly explains everything that is going to be on the midterm and final. Checks attendance by giving out worksheets in class that count for participation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing	560	5	5	5	5	1629491	4/5/12	I am taking his Advertising class right now and loving it. He has practical knowledge which is very important to me when I choose an elective. Very energetic and knowledgeable. One of the best in part time RIT professort. Recommend highly. Just one caveat you need to participate in class discussion by asking question and answering questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	1	Marketing		2	3	3	3	1629491	3/27/12	Alam is laid back and friendly but skims over important topics, or controversial issues, in favor of brevity and jokes. The depth of understanding required to do well on his tests is much deeper than any lecture he presents. He also tends to disregard your comments or questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	0	Marketing		5	1	1	5	1629491	2/3/12	Very close-minded and illogical. Doesn't care about your opinion, instead thinks he's right all the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Intekhab Alam	4.3	2	Marketing		5	4	3	4	1629491	1/23/12	He is really lenient and laid back. The class is interactive and a laptop is required. Consists of 2 tests (1 MC and 1 short answer), group project, and 5 in-class assignments (a way to take attendance, but he drops one at the end). Overall enjoyable professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Alexander	4.5	2	Environmental Science		5	4	5	2	1343935	4/27/10	Really nice guy who is very passionate about the subject. The tests were hard, but you could earn all the points you need for an A with extra credit alone. He's also open to suggestions; he replaced our final with a series of essays when we asked him to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Alexander	4.5	2	Environmental Science	101	4	5	4	1	1343935	1/4/10	so far pretty easy assignments, mainly lecture with group discussions to answer basic questions, have yet to find out for exams otherwise very openminded
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Alexander	4.5	2	Environmental Science	101	4	4	5	1	1343935	2/22/10	Very passionate about his work. Does a great job getting students involved and making us want to participate. Assignments are not difficult and extra credit is a huge help. It is sometimes hard to pay attention but he made me interested in the topics. If you have the opportunity, take his class. You will definitely learn something
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Alkins	2.0	2	Business		4	4	4	2	1407440	5/12/10	Very easy grader. Yes, he does assign a lot of hw in general but he even says he wants an honest effort and doesn't expect you to get it 100%. Which is why he can spend an entire class going over what you don't understand instead of focusing on what he THINKS you don't understand. Tests were straightforward and not too hard. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Alkins	2.0	0	Business	301	2	1	1	3	1407440	2/11/10	Uses slides from the textbook manufacturer, which are horrible. Reads them line for line. Doesn't explain concepts, but expects you to know how to do problems on them. Relies too much on the textbook, unrealistic amount of reading and homework assigned. Class time is very poorly constructed, not worth your time going.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Alkins	2.0	0	Business	101	3	1	1	2	1407440	2/17/10	absolutely worthless attending class. might as well just spend your class time reading the book. does not explain concepts...and terrible class structure...total n00b
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecilia Alm	4.2	2	English		5	5	5	4	1501151	2/12/13	Had her for Intro linguistics, and lang tech. very good instructor, classes are mostly activity-based rather than pure lecture, which makes learning the material easier and more fun. Classes are easy IF you do what you're supposed to. Both classes involved a research project, which requires a lot of work, but you choose a topic that interests you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecilia Alm	4.2	1	English		2	2	3	1	1501151	11/25/10	Turn back while you still can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecilia Alm	4.2	2	English		3	5	5	4	1501151	11/9/12	Excellent English professor in that she actually challenges you, unlike most others I've taken at RIT. She assigns a fair amount of work, grades fairly, makes lectures interesting, and is very helpful when walking around class and discussing w/ students. She's very approachable and brought us donuts on the last day of class. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Ambrogi	3.0	2	Fine Arts	102	4	5	3	5	1370396	11/16/12	Elements of F/A Class: Patti is a great professor if you are someone serious about photography. She isn't going to sugarcoat things for you-- if it sucks, it sucks, and she will challenge you to be better. Ultimately, she is my favorite professor at RIT so far. HIGHLY recommended. LOTS of knowledge/experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Ambrogi	3.0	0	Fine Arts	102	3	2	2	3	1370396	1/25/12	Elements of Fine Art class - this woman means well (I think...) but I have learned nothing from her ramblings and toothy smiles. Perhaps Fine Art is just not me forte, but she is never on time, always goes overtime on crits, can't stay organized, and hasn't taught me anything new. Want a scatterbrained easy A? Make good prints and she'll adore you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jane  Amstey	4.5	2	Honors		5	5	4	4	1760760	2/24/13	She is a wonderful lady. Her classes are highly interactive, a lot of in class work and participation is necessary. She will definetly put you outside your comfort zone. No textbook, no tests or quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Amuso	3.7	2	Electrical Engineering		3	4	3	3	1585803	3/16/13	Goes through material very slowly. Does not go through enough examples. Book is useless and homework problems are mostly irrelevant, but he gives you check-off points for completion. Tests can be hard but he usually curves them. An awesome guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Amuso	3.7	2	Electrical Engineering	554	3	5	4	2	1585803	4/3/12	He is amazing! you will work hard, and his tests fluctuate wildly in difficulty, but he is so helpful, and he grades easy when the class does bad on a test. Entertaining guy, really cares about his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Amuso	3.7	2	Electrical Engineering	554	2	5	4	5	1585803	5/26/11	Great Linear Systems (I and II) professor. Explains the math very well but the most useful aspect is his focus on abstract thinking and good explanation of block diagrams. Tests are usually open book and notes so write down EVERYTHING! Take good notes and you will do very well. He was incredibly helpful in office hours as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Amuso	3.7	2	Electrical Engineering	554	3	4	3	5	1585803	5/16/12	Great Professor, read the book and talk to him though. Linear II is much better than I and a lot more practical applications. Practically gives you the exam questions, but with a twist
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Amuso	3.7	1	Electrical Engineering	250	3	3	2	2	1585803	11/9/11	I had him for BME 250 (Engineering Analysis 1). Absolutely hated this class. Amuso was not fully to blame for this, he is a decent teacher and is willing to help with questions. Tests and assignments are open book/note, however this is no help when many cannot decipher the question...
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	66047	4/11/13	Talks too fast and doesn't cover material clearly. He is useless at answering questions, as he just talks in circles and leaves you wondering why he said anything at all. His tests aren't anything like he covered in class. He also assigns homework on the subject he plans to cover in class AFTER the homework is due. It's awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics	313	2	5	4	5	66047	3/3/13	He is a good professor. Lectures may go a bit fast at times but if you don't understand everything you should definitely go and see him during office hours, he is extremely helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics	703	2	5	4	5	66047	3/29/10	The best physics professors I have interacted with. always ready to help and challenges the student to think on his/her own. Always ready to give advise and extremely active when teaching. Knows the course really well but wants the student to dig in more . In his books efforts count a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	66047	1/12/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics		1	4	3	5	66047	10/17/06	Are you a genius? Then this is your professor. Unfortunately I'm not. If you can catch concepts at the speed of light and want to learn a new way of doing things(he really changed my way of doing problems, for instance, now i do everything algebraicly and then i plug in numbers), then chose him. But if you are not the best**** then go to another.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics		1	2	2	2	66047	6/21/05	Horrible teacher. Talks WAY too fast and will make you feel stupid for asking him a question. Impossible grader and his tests are never like any of the work done for the class. Claims to grade labs one way but will take points off for ridiculous things. Nit picks. DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY IF YOU WANT TO PASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	NULL	66047	5/4/04	Doc Andersen is a premium professor. he is helpful both in and out of class and is mad cool to boot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics	311	1	2	2	NULL	66047	2/25/03	Moves super fast, ask a question and he'll make you feel stupid. Such a bed prof that a 70 is an A and a 45 is a C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	1	Physics		2	3	3	2	66047	4/10/13	Very intelligent man. tests are BRUTAL. class average is around a 65 and curves it to a 75 however. show as much work as possible. vaguely goes over stuff and relies on the TA a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics	704	2	5	3	4	66047	1/6/13	Professor Andersen is by far the best professor I came across at RIT. Although I did not get an A in his class. He always tried to make the subject interesting and challenging at the same time
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics	312	2	2	2	1	66047	1/25/10	He is a very intelligent man however he is very vague when solving problems and assumes that everyone is on the same level, but I will admit that this office hour is the golden key to passing the class even though he doesn't leave much open so he's kind of hard to talk to if the time exceeds more than 30 minutes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	0	Physics		1	2	2	4	66047	11/13/06	Prof Anderson is a very smart man, but he is unable to recognize that students in physics 311 don't know as much as he does. When you ask him a question, he makes you feel very stupid and then hardly answers the question. Would not recomend unless you already know everything covered in the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics		2	5	5	5	66047	10/22/05	One of the best professor I ever have
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	1	Physics		1	4	2	3	66047	2/23/05	Anderson teaches WAY too fast. If you take him, don't be surprised if you have to do most learning from the book. He is very helpful though, outside of class hours, and tends to be able to teach things more slowly one-on-one. Also, his test questions are unlike anything he covers in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics		2	5	5	NULL	66047	4/3/03	Hard professor, but makes it up in the end with huge curve. Expect to learn a LOT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Andersen	3.3	2	Physics		1	5	5	NULL	66047	10/5/02	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	3	5	4	2	1213120	3/2/10	Boring lectures. Great professor otherwise, very flexible. If you need help hes more than willing to give and will go the extra mile if you prove to be a good student. Just chug a red bull before class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	3	5	3	2	1213120	4/28/09	The lectures are a bit dry and monotonous, but as long as you do the work well and try to participate in class, you will definitely get on his good side and ace the course
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	101	3	5	4	5	1213120	1/8/09	Very nice guy, great professor. A little dry and monotone, but if you go to class and pay attention, you'll learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	4	1213120	5/9/09	He was a great instructor. Taught the class well and helped when you were in trouble. All his grading was fair and I had no problem with him or the class. I advise him for intro to multimedia class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	0	Information Technology	220	5	1	3	2	1213120	4/26/09	Dry, boring, monotone. Endless powerpoints and stupid in-class exercises. The class material itself is terrible (think Internet 101) made worse by a boring professor. They NEED to rework this curriculum...about half of the content should be cut out. 90% of the info could have been self-taught in a few hours. Should be able to test out of this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Anderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	3	4	3	5	1213120	11/21/08	I enjoyed this class, even though his teaching was a little dry/boring. I've been doing XHTML/CSS for years but I still learned quite a bit from this class. Be prepared for a lot of reading and PowerPoint presentations, especially if you've never done web design before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Anderson	3.2	2	Business		5	5	4	4	1291474	11/29/09	Great class. I would recommend Prof. Anderson
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Anderson	3.2	0	Business		2	1	3	3	1291474	11/29/09	I would highly recommend professor Anderson, she is very helpful outside of class. It is a pretty easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Andreotta	5.0	2	Information Technology	414	5	5	5	5	1349424	4/21/10	Great teacher. Makes class fun and easy. I think I finished this course with a 120 average. If you do the work you will get an A, but it's not difficult or extensive so getting the A isn't hard. Gives tons of extra credit worth lots of points, hence the 120 average.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fjorentina Angjellari Dajci	2.2	0	Economics	511	2	1	1	1	1632827	4/20/12	not helpful at all, and gets offended sometimes when students ask questions during class(no idea why). huge textbook using, she expects you to do ALL the readings so that she doesn't have to go over everything during class. DISLIKE her class, worst class I've taken so far
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fjorentina Angjellari Dajci	2.2	0	Economics		5	2	2	4	1632827	2/2/12	Very easy teacher. All her tests are open book / open notes. You don't have to study to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fjorentina Angjellari Dajci	2.2	1	Economics		5	3	3	2	1632827	11/3/11	Heavy usage of MyEconLab, which basically means you should be getting 100s on any quiz / homework because you get multiple attempts. Everything was open-notes too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fjorentina Angjellari Dajci	2.2	2	Economics		5	3	4	4	1632827	3/28/12	Easy going and approachable professor. Heavy use of textbook and online program (MyEconLab) which helps reinforce skills. Most exams are open-note/book and some are done through the online program. Easy A or B depending if you put in the required effort. Gives lots of extra credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fjorentina Angjellari Dajci	2.2	0	Economics		3	1	2	3	1632827	11/9/11	Very heavy use of book and online sites, basically an online class. Teacher knew the material she was lecturing about but didn't convey it an an understandable manner. Not always clear in assignments, and in answering questions. Not recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Anthony	4.1	1	Architecture		4	3	2	1	1577622	11/11/12	He is unclear about things. Asked him for help several times and he was all for helping, looked it over a final time and didn't have much to say then he graded it and said it was horrible. If its horrible tell me when i am asking, not after i submitted it!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Anthony	4.1	2	Architecture		4	5	5	5	1577622	8/31/11	Good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Anthony	4.1	2	Architecture		3	5	4	4	1577622	3/14/12	Really interested in what he does. Always tries to find a link between your interests and makes class valuable and worth while.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Anthony	4.1	2	Architecture		4	5	4	1	1577622	5/10/11	Lectures dry, but you get slides. Go to them bc there could be grp work. Group work gets harder as week10 comes closer. If you get his help during labs then it can most likely guarantee you 100% on each lab. But very helpful prof and usually around bld7 before 4pm
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		3	4	4	3	729943	5/19/11	I had this professor for American Presidency history and I have to say he was my favorite this quarter. He did go off on tangents sometimes but it's not like they weren't interesting. I learned a lot about the presidency from him and I enjoyed listening to him lecture. I'm sad to say that he's retiring so people can't take classes with him any more
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	1	History		5	2	3	1	729943	4/29/09	Very smart guy. With that being said, you really only talk about the course information for about 15 minutes per class, the rest is him talking about random stuff like his family and what not. Be prepared to read and write more than any of your other history classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		5	3	4	5	729943	1/27/09	Like the others have said, he does go off on tangents, but his lectures are very interesting. He's full of random little facts that he loves to share. I would take his class again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		3	4	4	5	729943	9/29/08	he's really not a bad professor; just seems to get off topic a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	0	History	447	4	2	2	4	729943	1/31/07	He's a nice guy but cannot stay on topic, ever. He's definitely starting to show his age--can't ever seem to bring the right papers to class, doesn't answer questions but instead uses them as excuses for tangents. Be prepared for lots of reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	0	History		3	1	1	2	729943	10/25/05	I had him this quarter for American History: Special Topics, but with him, the course should be renamed American History: Random Tangents, as he can't stay on topic to save his life. If I could have given him zeros for helpfulness and clarity, I would have. For all of the papers we write, and all of the questions we asked, he answered only 1 or 2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	0	History	305	4	1	3	2	729943	10/26/10	While he's very knowledgeable in his field, he isn't a very good professor. He goes off on tangents which are interesting, but never really answers the questions that are asked. Grades fairly, but there is a lot of reading. Over all, nice guy, but if you don't like to read and write lengthy papers, this probably isn't a class for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		4	5	4	4	729943	2/3/09	The man is like an encyclopedia, any name or date or event he's got it. He does get off topic a lot and is strict with attendance. You will learn so much though, he is a funny old man. If you can take his class do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		4	4	3	3	729943	10/22/08	he can be weird and off point sometimes but his grading was pretty fair to the students and the essays were easy. there is no tests at all which is exactly why i took 3 different classes with him. i highly recommend him if you dont want any tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	0	History		5	1	2	3	729943	2/26/08	This guy is ok, assigns a lot of reading and writing, but for the most part grades more than fair. His lectures do get off topic, but are pretty interesting sometimes. Basically If you read the material the class is an Easy A or B
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		4	3	4	4	729943	2/1/06	hes an easy grader which is nice but you do some how learn alot about history even if the history isnt on the topic at hand i have taken several of his classes and plan on taking more he can be routinely late and also has heavy reading classes overall i suggest him just be able to tolerate tangents
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Anunziata	3.0	2	History		5	4	4	3	729943	10/19/05	He goes off onto crazy tangents constantly, but the material pretty much gets across, and he's definitely an easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Amberger	2.2	0	Engineering		1	2	2	1	809416	4/22/08	Everything you will learn is in the text. His tests are hard and his lectures aren't of any use. I've heard he can be quite helpful outside of class but don't bother during lecture. Also he likes you to know how smart he is; so stroke his ego a bit and he'll be more useful. Say how much you love trains too. Pulls all grades out of a hat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Amberger	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	809416	9/8/06	I've had the man for a week and I can't stand being in his class. I've sat in class for 4 freaking hours and i havent learned a single thing...other than "real engineers dont use slugs"....Avoid at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Amberger	2.2	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	809416	12/7/06	I had Prf. Amberger for Pneumatics & Hydraulics. He is an excellent professor and covers the material very thouroughly. If you're not a hard wroker and are not interested in learning, don't take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Amberger	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	809416	2/9/06	This guy is the devil. No partial credit...ever. Lecture is very unclear, and he grades like he's bipolar. Final grade in the class is not relavent to any grades during the quarter. He admitted to making the test hard to show us how little we'd learned. Class avg. was about a 40 on test 2. Terrible professor, not willing to help or be reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Amrine	4.0	2	Writing		3	5	4	2	1495204	12/5/12	He was always lively. He introduced the course by saying he wants to try to piss you off. If you are looking for a well educated dynamic teacher he is your kind of professor. You were given 1 week for essays and he grades rigorously. In class discussions require participation and he will play devils advocate to keep ideas and opinions flowing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Amrine	4.0	1	Writing	101	3	1	5	1	1495204	3/4/11	The man is unintelligent. He is everything I don't like in a person. He has fan group lackeys but I know I am not by any means alone in not liking him. He has no marketable skills, he's a failed author so he teaches English. He lies and makes facts up to prove his points, he teaches with a heavy bias. It's an easy A with a very stupid man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Amrine	4.0	2	Writing	277	4	4	5	4	1495204	4/23/11	A fairly easy class. He has a great personality and keeps the class interesting. One of the coolest professors I have ever had!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	1342894	11/9/11	Generally easy, remembers most students. Ungraded homework, all test allowed 1/4 page of notes. No final in the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering		5	4	5	1	1342894	5/30/10	I had her for solid modeling and DDT. She is probably the best professor in the MET department. She will take the time to guide you and assist you if you go to her office hours and ask for help. Really hot teacher also :) YOU MUST HAVE HER AS A PROFESSOR DO NOT GET MARIO CASTRO!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering	262	4	5	5	3	1342894	2/24/10	This is a great professor and she is just a very helpful lady. Kind, generous and just down to earth. I recommend her for any classes because you will enjoy her company and value her information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	1342894	11/12/09	Good looking and teaching professor. Her experience in industry is evident as she explains things. Very helpful in answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering	405	5	5	5	5	1342894	10/22/11	Great teacher. Definitely recommend taking her if you don't mind actually doing work and learning. One of few you want to take whenever you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering	432	5	5	5	4	1342894	4/27/10	Good looking, well actually HOT! She seems to be very compassionate, considerate and above all helpful. I wish I met her in person to tell her all the above! Thank You Dianne!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Amuso	4.9	2	Engineering	262	4	5	5	3	1342894	2/24/10	Great teacher and a sweet lady. she gives lots of second chances for homework and projects her grading is not tough so if you can draw it is okay. Alot of homework but she dropped two of them if you do the in class assignments she is very helpful when ask questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History	123	1	2	2	1	665094	1/21/13	I took his Italian Art class and the lectures were brutal. I am normally an A student and I failed his midterm exam! I studied for hours. So I withdrew. I will never take a class by him again. Save yourself the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History	102	1	2	3	5	665094	10/18/11	I took his Florence class because I love art history (it's my minor). Unfortunately I found his lectures to be incredibly dry, and this is coming from someone who LOVES the subject matter! He's very intimidating and comes off as superior. I know he has 600 degrees and he's clearly very smart, but come on. There's no need to be so intimidating.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		1	3	5	3	665094	6/16/10	His lectures are long but he knows everything inside and out, he can also be very funny. I took his western art class knowing I'd never do better than a C. I found his tests to be difficult but he's an awesome teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History	226	2	5	5	5	665094	3/23/10	I don't recommend this professor for people who aren't genuinely interested in art history. I achieved an A in his honor section, but it took a considerable amount of studying. His tests may seem tough, but an 82% is an A. I love his lectures - he is funny on occasion. Amy is an excellent speaker and a great writer!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History	101	2	5	5	3	665094	12/1/09	He is a great professor and knows so much about the subject! He is willing to work with students if you are having trouble. He gives you images to study for the tests, and doesn't try an trick you. Everything is very straightforward. Go to class and study the images for the test, and you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History	318	1	2	2	1	665094	10/21/09	Talks tons and expects that you remember everything. Pronounces everything fast so you can't understand what is said. Avoid if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	4	4	5	665094	8/5/09	Best Art History teacher ever! Great sense of humor and a great teacher. I took 3 classes with him and learned more than I ever thought I would!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History	101	1	5	4	3	665094	2/18/09	Hard but you learn A LOT. He's a very good teacher and he's definitely willing to work with you. His office is always open. He really knows his stuff too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		1	4	4	4	665094	11/18/08	Dr. Amy is one of the greatest teachers in general I've ever had. One of the best professors here. I learn so much in that class and his jokes are so subtle you barely notice at first but it wakes you up. It's such an easy class if you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	5	4	2	665094	10/16/08	Amy is difficult, but it's very easy to get a good grade by paying attention and studying even a little before tests. Obviously you won't do well if you don't put in any effort. He is VERY smart and a worthwhile teacher if you want to learn the subject. He's got a hilarious accent and sense of humor as well =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	4	3	2	665094	11/17/11	I'm a fan.knows way too much for his own good & is over qualified to be teaching.He goes on for ages about things we don't need to know because he is so passionate.Lectures are boring unless you care about history as much as he does. Sometimes he says funny things randomly.Take his class if you want to learn things you'll never need to know
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	5	4	1	665094	10/21/10	Took him for Survey of Western Art and Architecture. He is extremely intelligent and actually quite funny. He expects you to study a lot, but learning the required information is easy if you actually try.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		2	2	1	3	665094	5/10/10	I would take him if you know five languages and are really interested in art. He's a great teacher and very enthusiastic about his work but he is hard to keep up with during lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		2	2	2	1	665094	2/2/10	he's a nice guy, but his tests are impossible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History	318	1	1	1	1	665094	10/30/09	You came here to see whether or not you should take this class. This is your hint to avoid him. Pronounces everything so fast so it is impossible to pick up on it unless you are an art history expert. Don't take anything with him unless you plan on making it your priority class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History		1	2	4	1	665094	10/15/09	A lot of information and the exams are hard- he is also very intelligent which draws you in. But, he understands the he is highly over qualified for his job- so he cuts you some slack.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	5	5	3	665094	3/3/09	Amy is a hard teacher, but definitely worth it. You have to come to class to get the grade, and he sometimes gets a bad rep. Bottom line, he considers an 82 an A....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		5	4	5	3	665094	2/4/09	Amy can seem intimidating as first, but he is not that bad. He tells you EVERYTHING you need to know on the tests, you have to show up to class and to the memorization required. He curves his final grades to the point of absurdity (10 points on the final?!?) and offers multiple extra credit opportunities... Bottom line-do the work, get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		4	4	4	3	665094	11/18/08	Everyone says that Amy is awful and really hard, but students just take out their frustration for the subject out on him. He's really a good teacher and it is definitely not hard to get a good grade in his class if you at least try a little bit. He also does a lot of extra credit. There are other Art History teachers that are far worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		1	5	5	5	665094	2/23/08	Michael is just a great guy. He brings an extremely professional attitude to each lecture with enough humor to go around. I have really enjoyed every class I have had with him. His worldly knowledge illuminates foreign cultures and dialects. His papers can be tough but he is generous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History	101	2	5	5	1	665094	2/12/08	Brilliant Instructors who inspires his students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		1	1	1	2	665094	10/14/07	He tends to talk at such a fast/ monotone pace and mispronounces so that no one understands him. His study guides for the test do not include some of the material he covers for the test, and half the ones on the study guide aren't on the test. He makes you read pointless articles and novels that don't relate to the class. Terrible teacher in genera
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		3	5	4	5	665094	2/6/07	HYSTERICAL!! BEST JOKES EVER! im not kidding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History		3	2	3	4	665094	10/26/05	He prounces french words in a french accent, italian words in an italian accent, etc. Won't pronounce it in a way normal people understand, and when he spells things out he does it so fast you feel lost. He knows his stuff but brags about travelling like it's heavenly, if you wanna sit in class and look at slides, take his class, if not, sleep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		2	2	2	1	665094	10/19/05	boring as anything could possibly be
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		3	4	5	5	665094	9/8/05	Had him for Survey. Great teacher, but you have to study and pay attention. Studying is no problem, he lists the images he wants you to know, and what he wants you to know about them. Put a decent amount of effort in and you will get a ton out of his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		1	3	5	5	665094	8/30/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		1	1	3	NULL	665094	6/4/04	His test are VERY difficult, no matter how hard you study!! If you ask him for help he just tells you to read more, like that is going to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History	101	1	1	3	NULL	665094	11/21/03	Avoid this man at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		1	1	1	1	665094	10/23/07	this is the worst part of my day!!! and i mean it! i could never take the straight 3 hr class...trust me i tried it! def switch to another teacher if u can! all he does is show slide after slide after slide.the one that are on the test.and for test u have to kno the dates(exactly), periods, specifically where its located, made of, and who made it!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History		1	3	2	1	665094	9/11/07	A very tough teacher. He seemed nice enough to talk to, but don't expect that to help your grade at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History		3	3	3	3	665094	5/23/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	0	Art History		2	2	2	1	665094	10/24/05	I didn'treally learn too much from him, he is a very borning teacher and i never really knew waht to expect on a test because he changed things every time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	1	Art History		1	3	2	1	665094	10/18/05	this guy is so tough, but nice to his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		3	4	4	4	665094	9/1/05	Awesome prof with a ton of knowledge! Not for everybody though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	4	5	NULL	665094	9/5/04	Incredible teacher, honestly- but you have to want to learn. He knows his stuff and he will help you out a lot if you go to him during office hours. He gave me all the references I needed to write the final paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Amy	3.3	2	Art History		2	5	5	NULL	665094	5/15/04	I will make this very clear. Dont take this guy, unless you actually really want to learn something. Amy knows his art history inside and out, he's a genius. I admit his tests are somewhat very detailed, but he's a great speaker and gets the info across!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amber  Anderson	4.5	2	Anthropology		4	5	4	4	1799118	2/24/13	This professor is someone who is very passionate about what she teaches. She is also funny and will keep you focused. She will not post power points on my courses so attending class to take notes is imperative. The work is time consuming, however not difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	2	1479040	11/1/12	Denise is an awesome teacher. She knows what she is talking about. She doesn't lecture you. She gives very open projects and allows you to do what you want. She made me really mad the first few classes, but I ended up just wanting to impress her more. She is very honest and says what she thinks and that's helpful in learning design.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	0	Fine Arts		5	1	3	4	1479040	2/27/12	Easy class, but if you actually want to learn how to draw, don't bother. Constructive critiques are not a thing, rather "what pieces do we like the best". She doesn't actually teach lessons, just has upperclassmen come and teach in for 20 minutes every few weeks. I switched from a better drawing class to this one, and I regret my decision.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	1479040	4/27/11	Denise is awesome! She's completely honest and makes you want to work harder. She really knows how to teach college kids. Best class ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	1479040	10/19/12	She didnt teach as much as she just tells you what the project is. She is "helpful" in a sense that she tells you what needs to be worked on. Having taken only one other art class at RIT, I came in ready to learn something. The extent of her "teaching" is letting you figure it out which isnt helpful if you have no experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	3	1479040	1/24/12	She is a wonderful teacher! She is so chill but is clear with what she wants from an assignment which makes you want to work harder. I would take a class just to have her as a teacher again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Anderson	3.8	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	1479040	1/27/11	Phenomenal professor. She is hilarious, so edgy. She is super understanding and easy to talk to. I would def. recommend taking any class you can with her!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		2	2	5	3	363117	3/5/12	This class was primarily focused on weekly textbook reading and discussions. The discussions were simple with only 2 postings per topic needed. The quizes were very difficult with only 30 mins as the reading was lengthy and the questions were on the most random parts of the chapter. Teacher responded to emails but bad at responding personal emails.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		4	4	4	4	363117	5/20/09	Took his online class for American Politics. Great teacher, guided the discussions well and gave feedback when asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		3	5	5	5	363117	4/10/05	I thought prof andolino was an excellent teacher. He was easy to understand and even more easy to get along with..He is passionate about the subject matter which comes through in his lessons. There is a fair amount of work and the assignments were reasonable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	0	Political Science		1	1	1	NULL	363117	6/10/04	Russian History - Horrible professor!, I had a personal crisis at home and handed all of my work in less than a week late and he failed me on it - Doesnt have a heart - I did A Quality work - I had to pay another $2k to take the class over and got an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	363117	5/30/09	Took his online class, hes a good guy. Responds to discussions and encourages them
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science	211	3	5	5	3	363117	12/13/08	A gentleman & a scholar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		5	4	4	1	363117	10/26/04	American Politics - Not a bad professor at all. Made sure a student that had to be out of town for a week got everything she needed. Easy tests and videos during class (on topic).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Louis Andolino	3.9	2	Political Science		5	4	3	NULL	363117	3/8/04	My Grade: A. American Politics. Professor Andolino was decent. He was usually fair about the facts. Easy tests and videos during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	530	4	5	5	3	1209170	11/19/12	Great teacher. He tries to mix things up in class to keep things interesting by using videos and presentations between power-points. He's there if you have questions and the tests are open book and open notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	530	5	4	4	3	1209170	11/20/11	Although it's obvious he tries not to, he often overestimates how much time is left and goes over or crams. Open note, open book tests are great, if you have been paying attention and know where to find the subject in the book. Engaging if you're interested in the subject (I'm a non-business student). Actively welcomes and responds to feedback.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	101	4	4	3	3	1209170	3/7/11	Had him for a 4 hr class. Very long and drawn out, but is helpful when you need it. Not very strict with grading either, which is a plus. The tests are essay format with 15-20 multiple choice and also has extra credit opportunities.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	106	3	5	5	2	1209170	4/17/10	Amazing teacher, he made the course enjoyable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	4	1209170	11/8/12	GREAT prof. Interesting class, open book/notes tests, and hes a great guy, very helpful. Do the small amount of work and you'll do well. Take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	530	4	4	4	2	1209170	4/19/11	Though the material can be a bit dry and somewhat unorganized, Angelis does the best he can with what he has! He's very knowledgeable and personable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Angelis	4.5	2	Business	530	5	5	5	5	1209170	11/19/10	He has open book, open note tests and as long as you are familiar enough with the text to find answers, you should do decent on tests. As long as you put in the effort on essay questions and home work he will grade fairly. He also gives many extra credit opportunities.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Anson	4.3	2	Engineering	101	4	5	4	4	1482961	2/9/11	Great teacher. very approachable and easy to get help from. Not exactly easy but he reviews anything that you may have issues with. easily my favorite professor at RIT alongside professor Goodwill (math). highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Anson	4.3	2	Engineering		4	5	3	2	1482961	10/13/10	Teacher is pretty easy grader. Tests are pretty easy if you pay attention and hw is a highly recommended because a lot of the questions are the same on tests. If you know vectors already, take him and don't go to class. Thought he was boring until another teacher sub for a day and was worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Anson	4.3	2	Engineering		3	5	4	3	1482961	2/8/11	Anson is a great Professor. He is extremely helpful and will do everything he can to help you understand statics as long as you put in the effort. He's no Bullshit though, youre not gonna walk through his class. Do the homework everyday with the Tutors and you will do well in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicole Antonoff	4.0	2	Mathematics	204	2	4	4	4	1741215	8/15/12	Professor. Antonoff is very enthusiastic! But don't make her angry...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Garret Arcoraci	4.5	2	Networking Security & Systems	351	3	5	4	3	1723959	11/10/12	Great professor. Bought us pizza on last day of class! Sometimes goes on tangents, but knows what's he's talking about, and is very helpful in lab. Would recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Ardis	4.2	2	Computer Science	452	4	5	5	4	958584	2/28/09	Excellent professor. Provides daily quizzes to make sure that you understand the material the day it's taught. In addition, he provided short, but useful lectures that stepped through each concept taught in the class. In-class activities were very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Ardis	4.2	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	958584	2/14/07	Had Ardis for personal SE. It was a simple class but Ardis was able to explain pointers in C very well and could answer questions effectively. Allowed some late submissions which helped because some due dates were not always stated. Dismissed class early when he was done teaching, but stayed around in case you needed help on work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Ardis	4.2	2	Computer Science	444	4	3	4	3	958584	11/14/07	Course: Verification & Validation. Ardis is a good teacher, although his style doesn't match with me very well - I have a hard time paying attention. Otherwise, he is a good teacher, knows the material and is willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Armengot	4.0	2	Spanish	576	5	4	4	2	1697023	2/29/12	I took Trauma/Survival Narrative with her. It was a pretty laid back class, and was easy for me to do as long as you do what you're supposed to do. Projects are easy, and very open ended, and she's a really nice professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Arney	2.6	0	Science	890	3	1	1	5	741272	6/12/07	This professor lost interest halfway through. Gave contradictory instructions. Bad experience!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Arney	2.6	1	Science		3	4	2	3	741272	4/13/06	Very good technologist, not a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Arney	2.6	0	Science		3	3	1	5	741272	6/23/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Arney	2.6	2	Science		4	5	4	4	741272	10/30/05	This teacher is one of the most helpful I've ever had at RIT. He really wants you to understand the material. Lectures are interesting and sometimes funny. While not all of the material is really easy, he does his best to make sure you get it. I would definitely take another class with him given the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl  Atkins	1.0	0	Music		4	1	1	3	1793938	2/23/13	Very boring. Sits in front, talks quietly and slowly, rambles. Can't hear him over music. Never writes anything down. Had no idea what tests were on. Way too much to do (3 tests with essays, final paper, and group presentation.) Grades easily though. Would not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication	400	2	5	4	4	433426	11/11/12	Extremely helpful professor. Class is 1 grade-the thesis proposal. Don't slack off with it! I didn't do well but it's because I procrastinated and did it last minute. Prof Austin will meet with you if you whenever you wan. He wants you to do well. He won't baby you though. Use him as a resource! Work through out the quarter and you'll do wonderful!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		1	5	5	4	433426	9/30/10	Dr. Austin is always most concerned that students are grasping the material. He is a tough grader and calls you out if you don't give 100% effort, but I learned more from him than any other professor. If you try your hardest and he sees the effort you are graded on your ability to understand the material, not just memorize facts. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication	101	3	5	3	3	433426	2/13/10	I never had him in a class but he was always there in a pinch when I needed help with my communications minor. Very helpful, very accomodating!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication	535	2	5	4	1	433426	12/16/08	Bruce really knows his stuff and truly cares about his students so long as they make an effort in his class. For quantitative if you meet with him regularly and make the changes he wants then you will get an A. While attendance is not mandatory if you go it will really secure that wonderful A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		4	4	5	3	433426	9/8/05	Expect long lectures, little interaction. Class discussions will happen late in the quarter. Assignments are not hard but demand work. LOTS OF READINGS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		2	5	5	3	433426	11/30/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		2	4	5	NULL	433426	7/14/04	Bone-dry jokes, straightforward teaching. Highly recommended as he will _teach_ how to do a thesis, especially if you take advantage of his guidance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	0	Communication		3	1	1	3	433426	2/28/12	He was zero help, and discouraged me from working on a thesis I really wanted to do. I eventually withdrew from the class and took it the following quarter, earning a B. Very condescending. Thank goodness he left.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	0	Communication	535	1	1	1	1	433426	2/26/10	The worst teacher I've ever had. Get out of CMT now while you still have a chance to transfer. Do not take Research Methods with Austin. Do not stay in the CMT program. Do NOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		1	5	4	2	433426	4/12/09	Bruce is funny, unpretentious, informal, and demanding. I expected to hate Research Methods; instead, I look back at it as the most interesting class I took in the program. Bruce is relentless with the red ink (and his handwriting is comically bad), but he gives you every chance to get an A as long as you're willing to work for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	0	Communication		2	1	1	4	433426	6/20/08	This guy is smug
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		2	4	4	4	433426	8/30/05	Great guy who seems intimidating, but really isn't. Very helpful and ready to make sure you know what you're doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Austin	3.7	2	Communication		2	5	5	NULL	433426	8/15/04	definitely knows his stuff, very helpful, one of the best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	2	Imaging Science		1	5	5	5	432460	3/15/10	Great teacher, take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	5	432460	2/1/10	He's really the best teacher in the AIS department. Take him if you have a chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	432460	12/10/09	he's very critical about your work, don't cry when he insults you about your work. he can be very mean, but take him if u want to be criticized for your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	5	432460	2/10/10	Very helpful, and he's one of my favorites. He expects you to finish work in time, he'll give you a good grade! Take him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	0	Imaging Science		2	1	1	2	432460	12/14/09	mean and strict, yells at ya 4 no reason.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Omobowale Ayorinde	3.5	2	Imaging Science		3	4	4	5	432460	12/8/09	He's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Bacot	5.0	2	Mathematics	212	4	5	5	4	1287221	5/15/09	He is very patient professor. Sometimes, I wish he has good confidence. He is very quiet, he doesn't want to deal with troubled students in person when there is needed. Overall, he is good at explaining. I recommend this professor for Integrated Algebra course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	216	5	5	4	4	497462	2/19/13	Besides her accent, Dr.Bailey is very straight forward and her powerpoints are super helpful(no need to read the book).MasteringChem HW due every sunday which are easy.4 exams(drops lowest),additional 2points to overall grade for iClicker. Be in class, and do your studying and you'll get an A. Dr.Bailey is very cheerful and nice to all students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	1	Chemistry	202	4	3	2	2	497462	1/24/13	Dr. Bailey takes some getting used to. Her accent is thick, but after some time, you adjust quite easily. As long as you do your work, she's willing to work with you and give a couple of bonus points here or there. However, she doesn't enjoy when students ask questions in class...otherwise, she is wonderful at lecturing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	216	4	4	3	2	497462	12/17/12	A little hard to listen too but very helpful. I think she makes chemistry easy... almost
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	216	4	5	5	5	497462	2/7/12	Bailey is an awesome professor and really makes students work hard. I really wish she taught the third quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	101	4	1	2	3	497462	1/18/12	She does not understand questions and just repeats what she has already said. She knows the material well but can't convey it to the students well. It is an easy A, but I went on to Chem II and hadn't learned some valuable information that I needed for the first test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		4	2	2	5	497462	6/29/11	I had her for both Fundamentals of Organic Chem and Biochem. She was seemed to have a good knowledge of the organic chemistry concepts and did a decent job of teaching those. In Biochem however, she seemed like she had very little knowledge of the subject and did a TERRIBLE job teaching it. Personally, I think you get used to her accent quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	101	5	4	3	5	497462	2/15/11	well i had her last quarter, and she's not very nice to me, nor helpful. but easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	1	Chemistry	215	5	1	4	3	497462	1/25/11	I was with her last quarter. She graded my so hard so that I have to got up 95 for my final to get an A. but eventually I got it since it's easy. well I would recommend her if this is not your required major course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	1	Chemistry	215	5	2	3	3	497462	12/9/10	i like how she's easy but not her teaching style. it was easy but pointless. and not helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	101	5	1	1	1	497462	3/1/10	Pointless class. just show up to sign the sheet then leave. hard to understand her accent. tests are online with friends. final is hard if you dont do any work during the class. just bear with it and youll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	4	497462	2/8/13	After the first class with Bailey, you may leave thinking that its going to be a long quarter, but then you'd be wrong. You get used to the accent overtime. Her lectures are pretty dull, but if you use the book you'll be fine. She's funny and actually really helpful, if you make the question clear. But shes the best because its so easy to get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	216	2	1	1	3	497462	1/24/13	Awful. Very hard to understand and she is very unhelpful. Does not explain her lectures properly and doesn't answer questions well. She is not very nice and the material she covers in lecture is nothing like the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	216	2	1	1	2	497462	12/9/12	Honestly, one of the worst teachers I have ever had to deal with. Very unhelpful and unclear. She gets angry when you don't understand the answer and is not nice to her students. She does not explain things thoroughly enough. Her lectures are boring and it is difficult to understand her accent. Homework counts for very little.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	202	2	2	1	1	497462	2/1/12	Absolutely miserable. She may know what she's trying to teach but she can't teach it. Reads off her slides, and is very very hard to understand. Drops the lowest test grade though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	215	2	1	2	3	497462	10/8/11	Very hard to understand, teaches material straight from slides. If asked a question about how she did something, she just spits back what she just said, clearly doesn't understand her students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		5	1	1	3	497462	4/25/11	gives you all the formulas but is overly picky with lab reports and nearly impossible to understand. she also tends to have trouble understanding questions and gives an answer that has no bearing on the question then leaves before you can elaborate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		4	5	3	3	497462	2/2/11	She is really helpful and wants everyone to do well. There were clicker quizzes sometimes and the tests were online so you can use all of your notes, the book and of course the internet. The only problem I had was that she has a very strong accent, so it took a few weeks to understand her well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	216	5	2	2	3	497462	1/12/11	Too easy. This class is easier than my high school chemistry class, and my high school chemistry class was a joke! Don't expect to learn a lot of chemistry. Expect bonus galore to inflate your already inflated grade. Class lectures can be boring. Don't bother buying the book, just get the Mastering Chemistry access.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	4	497462	11/18/10	She put presentations and practice tests online and was often available for help. Lectures were easy to follow, but she sometimes switched slides too quickly for people to take notes. Her tests were tough but nothing you couldn't predict.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	215	5	1	2	2	497462	1/28/10	A waste of time to show up to class. Helpful in that she handed out the powerpoint slides, but she just read you the slides. I went in, picked up the notes, read them in ten minutes, and slept the rest of the class. Tests were easy, homework frustrating, overall easy A...but the class was boring, and the accent could be a little crazy sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	101	3	5	4	4	497462	11/12/09	russian accent but you get used to it and you can just read along with the outlines. shes a really good teacher, grades easy, gives out bonus points and lets you have cheat sheets on the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	101	3	4	3	1	497462	8/3/09	She was a teacher with great interest in her subject which made her a much better teacher than most in her field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	497462	2/18/09	She is the most worst teacher I ever taken. I strongly recommend not to take her. She has a Russian accent which makes it harder to understand. She often does not help fully. Most likely test are every 2 weeks and exam is optional which is nice..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		5	4	3	4	497462	1/22/09	She has a heavy Russian accent and it can be difficult to understand her at times. Her lectures tend to be long and boring. However, she is very thorough at explaining things and is willing to help you if you need it. Her outside-of-class review sessions were a life-saver =]
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	101	4	1	1	3	497462	11/19/08	Nobody can understand her, and she can't understand any of our questions. She micromanages her students, constantly interrupting the lecture to wake people up, yell at them for talking, or tell people to put away their laptops. It feels like being back in middle school again. I didn't learn anything, material was easy. At least it's an easy A.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		3	2	1	1	497462	11/11/07	can anyone understand her? and even if i can, its a 2 hour powerpoint presentation every day. terrible. slept almost every class. not a good teacher at all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	4	497462	12/4/06	She's very hard to understand because of her accent. She tries to be helpful but unfortunately has a hard time understanding questions. Class itself is a bit on the hard side, but doable if you study. 3 tests, drops lowest, plus a final. OWL sucks, but the 10% of your grade makes a difference. I wouldn't take it again but it's really not bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		2	2	1	5	497462	2/5/06	Wow her english might as well be russian her accent is so thick and do not ask a question because she will ramble on for hours about something not related to your question
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	201	4	5	4	1	497462	10/26/09	She is one of the sweetest professors ever! She calls us " my friends" which is always nice. The way she uses her powerpoints ae=re helpful, if you have questions she really tries to answer it. Attendance and participation are important, she wants you to care and work hard. Gives a lot of bonuses and " gifts" on test. Accent- youll get used to it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	215	4	4	3	4	497462	3/6/09	good professor and nice. it was a little hard to understand her Russian accent but you can just read along in the print outs she gives you. tests fairly easy. And if i can give one piece of advise it is to NOT SKIP CLASS! she takes attendance at every lecture and somehow memorizes every student and whether or not they have EVER missed her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		5	1	1	4	497462	2/13/09	Her Organic Chemistry class is very easy. Even gives you bonus points for homework. However, she is an extremely, extremely annoying person. She speaks Russian, not English. She can't say half of the words correctly. Worst of all, she takes away from her "A" students learning to talk about how her D and F students don't come to her lectures...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	2	497462	1/19/09	Anyone who wouldn't want a mad Russian scientist for a chemistry professor is obviously out of their mind. She's strict when it comes to attendance and paying attention in class, but she is a very helpful, sweet person if you put forth the effort. Basically, just don't be a slacker. It's that simple.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		2	4	3	3	497462	11/14/08	She has a heavy russian accent that you would get used to after one or two weeks. She will be very helpful if you go to her for help. However, she doesn't always wait until you finish your question to answer- so it's frustrating when she answers a question that you didn't mean to ask. Dont give up, make sure you don't get behind and you willbe fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry	101	5	2	2	3	497462	11/1/08	I wish she would let us finish asking the question before she starts answering what she thinks we're asking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	101	2	5	4	4	497462	7/30/08	I had Dr. Bailey for Gen Chem, Organic Chem & Biochem. She is a wonderful teacher and wants all of her students to succeed. She is smart, fun and a very hard worker. Her work ethic inspires you to work hard at Chemistry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	208	2	5	3	3	497462	11/8/07	She has a Russian accent that is challenging to understand at times but for the most part you get used to it. She does all her lectures as power points. the hardest part of the course was the online stuff. online tests were hard and hw online isnt much fun
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		3	2	1	1	497462	11/6/06	The worst teacher ever!! The first day of class she took the mike into the bathroom when it was on. That is about the only thing I learned or learned not to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		2	3	1	3	497462	2/5/06	Cannot understand what she is saying. Should not be teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	0	Chemistry		4	1	1	1	497462	1/31/06	Oh my God! The class was horrible. Don't take it at 8:00am if you can help it. She is barely understood through her accent and she rarely answers questions that are asked. One good thing is that she holds study sessions and gives a lot of extra credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		4	5	3	2	497462	10/26/05	I agree, if you can get passed the accent then you are going to do good... as long as you do your work! Great lady though, she really loves her students and tells us often!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	208	4	5	4	4	497462	1/28/05	Great Teacher - Very Helpful - Almost always available to assist you. Some trouble understanding the accent but if you can get past it then you are set. Very interesting Teacher and lots of experience in chemistry

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry		3	5	2	3	497462	2/1/05	Shes a babe
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alla Bailey	2.7	2	Chemistry	208	3	4	4	2	497462	11/13/04	Very cool lady who has great stories to share about her work. Once you see beyond the accent, you can learn a bunch from her lessons. She puts the lecture material into layman's terms.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Bailey	3.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1542449	10/26/12	Dr. Bailey knows her thermo. When I took it there was only 1 section, and her tests were hard, but thermo exams are ALWAYS hard (and all sections take the same exam anyway), and she curved at the end of the class. She wants to see you succeed though, and loves it when you ask questions, either in class or in office hours, and is very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Bailey	3.0	0	Engineering	413	4	1	3	3	1542449	12/2/11	Seems to know what she's talking about, but she babies you. Makes you tab stuff in the text (which she helped write), and assigns groups for in class work based on a personality test. It seems that she's trying to be too innovative and focuses on being different to the point that it impedes her ability to teach thermodynamics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Bailey	3.0	0	Engineering	413	2	2	2	3	1542449	1/26/12	Might be ok if classes were twice as long. Has a tendency to teach material required for homework due later that day. Class is centered on group work with minimal teaching. Take if you don't mind learning on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	241	5	5	5	4	620090	1/25/11	Great teacher. One of my favorite professors I've ever had. Crystal clear, brilliant guy, very knowledgeable. Take this (relatively easy) class if you have a desire to learn something. It's an easy A if you pay attention and absorb the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy	509	5	4	4	4	620090	11/17/08	good professor, the class is easy. BUT be careful on quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	4	620090	5/21/06	Puts great notes on the board. Is a pretty nice guy and his 4 exams aren't difficult if you go to class and take notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	620090	5/15/05	Easiest class my spring quarter. Only 4 tests...no final. The tests were simply 4 questions...pick 2...and write anything you could remember on that philospher. He even let you do a third question for extra credit. I dont know anyone who did poorly in the class. THa material was interesting too!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	1	Philosophy		2	3	3	3	620090	11/19/09	Aguilar overall is a great professor. He has 4 exams, no hw and no finals in the class. The problem is that he is very unfair on the grading for the 4 tests, he gives you 2 to 4 questions and they are not easy at all! People say he is easy, but he is not at all when he teaches philosophy.Some of the text can be hard, so take notes and attend class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	1	620090	2/6/08	Great Professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesus Aquilar	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	3	4	1	620090	3/15/06	Good guy. Teaches well if your interested in the subject. 4 tests, no final, no quizes. Read 4 books all under 50 pages. Pretty simple. Easy B if not A if you just show up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Arday	2.2	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	5	596680	4/21/07	ugh. Dull and pointless. Yes, we know wht you do, now can YOU teach US how to do something worthwhile? I paid a LOT of money for nothing. Do NOT take his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Arday	2.2	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	2	596680	4/13/05	What a crappy teacher. He spent more time puffing up his own ego, than he did teaching me anything worthwhile. He needs to go back to school to learn how to run a crit, what was the point. You can be critical, and be nice. Do not take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Arday	2.2	2	Fine Arts		1	5	3	3	596680	9/2/05	I found this class although quite long winded, he was very helpful for me. He may be a pain at times, but I think it is worth anyones time to take at least one of his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	0	Design		2	1	1	1	401128	4/1/12	Strictness should come with the instructor's own commitment to carry out the tasks he/ she should do. In case of Jason, this isn't the case. I have no reason to take his class if it wasn't a mandatory class. His design tastes are horrible, yet his critiques are very subjective and useless. Good luck. You'll need one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	0	Design		1	2	2	3	401128	11/29/11	He repeats himself often, uses terms incorrectly, and praises work that does not accomplish the projects goals. He also has a hard time giving helpful feedback, his critiques are highly subjective and opinionated.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design	101	1	3	4	5	401128	5/26/11	First opinion of him: he's just OK. He critiques like he is really into your work, then gives you a lower grade than anticipated(or what he alludes to during critiques). Not really sure what is up with that. Kinda confusing and misleading, which will really irritate people who take their grades very seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		2	5	5	5	401128	1/27/10	The Ying to Adam's Yang, Jason is every bit as hard as Adam (a little less scary)and just as knowledgeable and helpful. He'll expect the best and have you creating projects you didn't know you were capable of producing. Jason is amazing, hands down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	0	Design	232	2	2	2	4	401128	3/21/07	Obviously there are people out there who don't fit in to this guy's idea of WHO is fit for new media. That's his problem. He judges. You can tell the minute you have a moment with him whether or not he's going to be fair with you. It FEELS like he's personnaly looking for those who will follow in his footsteps...the rest of ya... whatever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	401128	9/6/05	Jay is one bad ass prof. Listen and you will learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		3	5	5	5	401128	8/30/05	Jason Is The man in new media, so if u treat him well he will treat you well, the best Prof i had at RIT

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		4	5	5	5	401128	11/19/04	I had Professor Arena for Time-Based Imaging, and I really enjoyed the class. I heard students complaining about how some of the instructors didn't teach well, but this guy knew what he was doing. I learned a great deal from him, and I hope to have him as a teacher in future courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	0	Design		4	1	1	NULL	401128	5/3/04	This class was a waste of time, Jason cared about the class almost as little as the other students did. New media seems like it's really falling apart.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	0	Design		1	1	2	4	401128	1/5/12	Constantly states he will do things but does not. Never answers emails. States that he will give feedback via email and does not. Warns us to not email him on a Sunday night(we have class on Monday)to ask him questions, yet proceeds to email us after 7pm on Sunday night(this happened more than one occasion) telling us something is due Mon at 8am.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	1	Design	101	1	3	3	5	401128	5/26/11	LOL @ "yin to Adam's yang" - who even writes something like that?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	1	Design		4	2	3	5	401128	9/12/10	i'm not a fan. he's very full of himself and though he knows what he's doing he cant teach it. i find when i ask him questions he contradicts himself a lot, like he's not sure how to help you. can't think of one thing i have learned from him. and though he is a lot nicer than adam, i think he is useless as a professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	1	Design		4	2	3	5	401128	1/12/10	LOTS of favoritism. if you buy in to his corny jokes and what his idea of a good design is he will love you. if not, meh. but he really judges you on a very non-objective level based on his preferences not on design in general.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		3	4	4	4	401128	8/14/06	Jason is the best teacher I have had in the New Media department. His assignment are spread out well and each of them serves a purpose. The critique is also helpful, gives ideas on what to change to make your project better and takes into account your point of view. Few joke quizes that he doesnt really look at.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		2	4	5	5	401128	8/31/05	jason was great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		3	4	4	2	401128	8/30/05	I dont see what you all are such big Arena fan.s Hes ok. If you dont have your prework spotlessly done, dont bother showing up for class. Youll wish you hadnt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		3	5	5	3	401128	11/22/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Arena	3.5	2	Design		4	5	5	NULL	401128	7/15/04	Awesome guy! A Flash God. If he doesn't know it, he'll look it up. He'll push you to make improve everything, but this usually results in an insanely amazing project. He is also willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	2	Languages		5	4	4	3	1628491	1/29/13	Easy grader, really friendly guy. Makes lame jokes. I recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	2	Languages		4	4	4	3	1628491	5/17/12	Overall nice guy and good teacher. From the Dominican so he has a bit of an accent but nothing thats too hard to understand. Online textbook required for classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	1	Languages		5	3	3	4	1628491	4/27/12	He is a super easy grader, and if you do any amount of studying at all, you'll get an A. Very funny and easy-going. I don't really see how you could do bad in the class. I really don't know what the other person was talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	0	Languages		4	1	1	4	1628491	9/5/12	Inadequate. Very unorganized and wishywashy. Easy professor, but assigns wayyyyy too much homework. Is clearly a biased grader and is discouraging/rude to students.I used to want to learn Spanish, until I took this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	2	Languages		2	4	3	4	1628491	5/14/12	Good professor. As is common with Spanish classes I've taken in the past, a lot of work is assigned but not collected or graded. Gives into complaints of students a lot and maintains a pretty easy class. Like most language classes at RIT, there is a decent amount of work associated with the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Godys Armengot-Mejia	2.8	0	Languages	560	3	1	1	2	1628491	10/19/11	I took spanish with him and it was horrible for me because I have never learn spanish before and all he does is mumbling by himself. he's not organized, and he always lost what we turned in, like our midterm exam. he doesn't know how to speak english. BUT if you already know spanish, take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walker Ashley	3.0	1	Business		3	3	3	2	1257215	2/25/09	One of the most ridiculous professors I have ever had to have. All day she reads off slides that she will later put online, you must show up to class; after 2 absences letter grade reduction. Horrible grader, doesn't know how to "teach", will take points off your grade if fart to loudly during a presentation. Should not be a college professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	3	621243	11/18/11	Very knowledgeable professor, but tends to just stand and lecture straight through the entire class, which can be boring at times. But he gives out all the notes you will need. Just study the notes and the tests are fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	1	Science		3	4	2	1	621243	11/28/10	Very Understanding. Turned in all my hw 2nd to last day of class and he didn't take any points off even though it was very late. Must read the book because test can get pretty hard. All he does is lecture, no notes on the board. He just stands up at the front of the class and talks for two hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	3	621243	10/19/09	A wonderful educator who brings alot of practical knowledge and experience to the table. Very accessible and much more helpful and cordial to students then the majority of the faculty at RIT. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	1	Science		5	3	2	3	621243	8/30/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	2	Science		4	5	5	4	621243	11/28/10	(Microbio) I loooooove this professor and this class. It's not even my major and I talk about what I learned there all the time. What you learn in helpful -- you learn what sickness you might have! Tests are purely memorization, so learn your Latin microbs! :P Awesome class. Take it if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	2	Science	101	3	5	4	4	621243	11/4/10	He is very nice and always helpful. His tests are kind of hard though. No textbook required, which is nice. Had him for med lab procedures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	3	621243	9/8/07	very clever, he knows a lot and very nice to students
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Aumer	4.1	1	Science		5	3	2	2	621243	5/17/05	Lots of lecture, not any discussion, he needs to get rid of the overheads and use powerpoint. Classes are very boring, most people sleep, the lab on the videos is easy they give you all the answers on handouts. Very boring but easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Axon	4.0	2	Physics	318	2	4	4	4	492397	11/15/07	All I need to say is that this professor is there for the students and not for the money. Even though he is hard because it's difficult to squeeze in the material in 10 weeks, he's definitely a recommendation because of his flexibility. He unlike many professors isn't rigid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Babbitt	5.0	2	Biology		5	5	5	4	1644539	3/5/13	He really wants you to understand the material and teaches in a way that allows you to make connections to previous knowledge. Labs are GREAT way to learn material. Keep detailed lab notebook for lab quizzes. Don't need to read book, but good tool for studying for exams. Use his study guides and do all homework and you'll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Babbitt	5.0	2	Biology	240	4	5	5	4	1644539	11/14/11	Good sense of humor, lots of great stories to tell. Tests are pretty easy. Stay on top of material and it's impossible to miss an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Babbitt	5.0	2	Biology	240	4	5	5	5	1644539	5/2/12	Hilarious, tries to keep things interesting. Very helpful. Class is not difficult at all if you read the text...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Austin Baddeley	4.4	1	Physical Education		3	3	3	4	1330606	3/7/12	Very helpful when he teaches, too bad he only taught maybe 2 classes for 20 mins. Sede James was the main instructor, and boy was that dude an ---. He basically stopped our practice every 2 seconds to talk us to death, was disrespectful (referred to students as 'hey you'), and belittled the assistants who were more knowledgable. Take Trezza!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Austin Baddeley	4.4	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	1	1330606	11/21/11	Easy and relaxing wellness class. Must attend, only get one skip. No homework, even though he says there is, he never checks it. He even states that this class is hard to fail and if you want there's always other wellness classes to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Austin Baddeley	4.4	2	Physical Education		5	5	4	3	1330606	10/2/09	Fun class, prof was easy going and knew his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Austin Baddeley	4.4	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1330606	11/28/11	Easiest wellness there is. Just show up and talk about stress. He gives good stress tips.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Austin Baddeley	4.4	2	Physical Education	100	5	5	4	3	1330606	10/13/09	Helped me out with my stress, and problems I was having outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kymberly Bailey	4.0	2	Business		5	2	5	2	1404364	10/31/12	VERY EASY CLASS. You can do all the work for the class in one weekend. Must attend, Business Professional Attire is Mandatory. Although, if you are NOT an accounting major, you may want to think twice about taking her class. I'm an MIS major and all she talked about was Accounting, and Accounting professions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kymberly Bailey	4.0	2	Business		5	4	3	2	1404364	2/26/10	Only take her for Careers in Business if you are an accounting or finance major. I mean... she's okay. She tried to relate to the other majors, but she doesn't have any experience in the fields, so not very useful. Deff a valuable resource for you accounting/finance people though because her job outside of RIT is to find accounting jobs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kymberly Bailey	4.0	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1404364	9/4/12	Nice teacher and a simple class. Only a handful of classes, so attendance is mandatory. Almost everything you learn and do can be applied to getting a job in the future. Very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Bajorski	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	1725735	2/22/13	He speaks with a Polish accent, but is mostly fluent. You are allowed a formula sheet on tests. Tests are trickier than homework problems, but not terrible. Lectures are dull.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Bajorski	3.8	2	Mathematics	841	5	5	3	4	1725735	5/21/12	Professor Bajorski genuinely cares about this students success. He answers questions very promptly and his tests are VERY fair. The only thing I did like was that the lectures are long but I really like that he doesn't automatically assume that everyone is a math professional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyev	3.7	2	History	448	4	4	4	5	1583804	11/1/12	Very good professor. Lectures quite a bit. No need to take notes, just glance through the readings and you'll be fine. Very little work to do at all or assignments. The few you have to do are nothing compared to other classes. Always available for help if you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyev	3.7	2	History		3	5	4	4	1583804	9/13/11	very helpful. interesting projects. very good lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyev	3.7	1	History		4	3	2	5	1583804	5/21/11	While it may seem like an interesting subject the professor essentially drones for 2 hours. Most students do not pay attention in class and just browse the internet. Work is not hard and for the most part creative and is graded fairly. She works well with the class and will email back quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyev	3.7	1	History		4	4	2	1	1583804	1/30/12	Decent teacher. Extremely helpful when you need help. Took her modern euro history class, it ended up being about the crusades. Deadlines aren't a big deal. The class is boring, an easy A, fills a credit, and has little work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyev	3.7	2	History		3	5	4	5	1583804	9/3/11	Great class. She assigned some cool projects. She is very helppful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Baldridge	2.2	0	Business		1	1	1	1	363071	10/23/05	avoid this guy...horrible professor, picks favorites and screws everyone else over. not worth the hassle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Baldridge	2.2	2	Business		3	4	4	NULL	363071	3/8/04	Professor is deaf, but communication is good. Overly organized and a bit anal, but has good insight and anecdotes at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Baldridge	2.2	0	Business		2	2	1	3	363071	6/16/05	Hard to understand. Expects you to know everything even if you are not a business major, otherwise you are SOL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	2	Film		2	3	4	2	1418175	11/9/11	He is al right, not too worse or best professor....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1418175	9/29/10	Charles is by far one of my favorite teachers. He knows the field front and back, and is a valuable resource for students who take education seriously. He's very approachable and will critique honestly, and usefully. He will take your concerns and make them his own, going far out of his way to bring you a solution.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	0	Film	101	2	1	2	5	1418175	4/25/10	Charles Bandla's class is pointless. He repeats the same lines over and over again for every animation you watch, and that is all you do--watch animations he has downloaded from the internet onto his computer. You will learn nothing new in this class and the assignments are almost identical to the class' prerequisite course "Single Frame Motion."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	0	Film		1	1	1	1	1418175	4/4/10	Awful teacher, lectures for 4 hours and will make us do work at the last minute. Doesn't know how to motivate kids.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	2	Film		3	5	4	3	1418175	11/16/10	Bandla is a great teacher for those who really put forth the effort and are interested. Grades got heavily weighted towards the end if he felt he graded too harshly, and he allows you to redo any project and hand it in by the last friday of the quarter. Definitely an easy A if you put forth an average amount of effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	2	Film		4	4	3	5	1418175	8/16/10	I thought he was a good source of information and learned more in this class than in Single Framed Motion. He showed a good variety of types of animation and some of the projects we did were very fun. Sometimes he was a tough grader but the really easy final makes up for that. The class can get boring since it is 4 hours long.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bandla	3.4	2	Film		3	5	5	4	1418175	4/10/10	Had Charles for many classes. He is as clear and helpful as you could ask a teacher to be, and is a good and personable guy in addition. He can talk nuts and bolts as much as he can talk fine arts, and gives laser-critique. By the way, we are not "kids" and the subject should be your motivation in this field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	4	1254910	10/26/11	Wonderful Teacher, great listener, friend, she is really trying to help you strive or survive. Not a hard class by any means, deff fun too. Get to talk a lot about many things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	1254910	1/31/11	Extremely easy class. Not too many assignments, do the work and you get an A. Great teacher and always there to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	4	1	1254910	3/31/10	Very helpful but tries way too hard to get the class to care about FYE. Assignments are easy as long as you remember to do them, no one did. Class was a low-point of my week as I felt the FYE was equivalent to that of the things you do in 4th grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	4	1	1254910	2/14/09	Easy assignments that put you back in high school. Lot's of reflection journals and touchy-feely assignments. However, she grades nicely. She has high expectations for community involvement: Stresses networking, clubs, and leadership positions. Excellent coaching, but sometimes you want her to stop telling you things 'you should/can do'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	3	4	1	1254910	4/23/11	Very easy class, almost impossible to not get an A in. Not particularly funny or interesting but still could have been worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	1254910	1/27/11	Krysta Banke is very nice and sweet. At first I thought she was fake but she is really not. She does care about your success. At one point she even helped me through my transferring from RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Krysta Banke	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1254910	10/30/09	She is very fun and insane. She's really weird, but she's nice, and really wants to help students. I strongly recommend her for FYE. She's pretty cute, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		1	2	5	4	729670	11/11/12	Tough class. Expect really difficult tests and Practicals. Don't expect him to hold your hand or help when you are lost. Kinda a grouch but extremely knowledgeable. He knows a ton, I just wish he was more happy about sharing it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		2	3	5	5	729670	2/28/12	He is an old grouch and proud of it. I loved the class. You must show up and spend time learning the material. No late work is accepted, so do it on time. If you do your work and aren't an idiot you'll be just fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	0	Information Technology		1	2	1	5	729670	11/9/11	People will often say that they learned a lot with barido as a teacher. What they fail to mention is that Barido does not in fact teach you anything. He will instead patronize you and make you learn everything on your own. He takes pride in failing students and otherwise ruining their lives. He's the sole sys2 teacher. Avoid this guy and this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	421	2	3	4	3	729670	7/23/11	Had Professor Barido for Comp System Fundamentals an Sys Admin I. I thought he was fair in CSF but he ruined my life in Sys Admin 1. Take only if you feel like dealing with an old grouch.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		2	5	5	5	729670	2/5/11	Very good professor, and very knowledgeable about his subject. Learned a lot about UNIX and lectures were interesting. Already knew Windows stuff because I am a Windows Admin for a fortune 500 company. Take him, he can be a bit hard but you will walk away with a wealth of information
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	350	2	3	4	4	729670	7/21/09	While it may seem like he's a hard professor (and he can be), he definitely knows what he's talking about. Show up to class and take notes--they won't be posted anywhere. Pay attention and you should do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	402	1	3	4	3	729670	11/23/08	Barido is a very hard teacher. He teaches Unix commands via slides, but doesn't make them available to the class. Mid-term and final exams are VERY hard, often requiring you to memorize very obscure things. Practical exams are also hard, and are very complicated versions of otherwise simple tasks. You'll learn, but not before being broken by him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	422	3	5	5	5	729670	1/31/07	Very Dry, his lectures are boring, but the man definitly knows what he is talking about. He managed a large crew @ Kodak for a long time....nothing replaces actual work experience. If you ask a question, don't expect it to be an easy answer. He is hard, you can't bs him at all, but he is fair, thorough, and you will get a lot out of him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	402	2	5	5	3	729670	11/3/06	He went over the midterm exam in a way that anything I did not know on it before, I then knew which helped a lot. He knows his stuff very well, I would take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	3	729670	10/18/05	A little bit of a stick in the mud, but cares about helping his students. Lab sucked, still got a B though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	422	1	5	5	5	729670	5/11/12	My favorite professor of all time. He is not a hand holder, you have to attend class, lecture slides are not provided. He knows his stuff top to bottom. You will learn so much if you aren't incompetent. I only wish I could take sys3 with him before I leave.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		2	5	5	5	729670	2/27/12	One of the best professors in the NSSA department. He's not a hand-holder, so don't expect to get coddled. Doesn't post slides, so attend lectures. You WILL learn when you take a course with Barido, and you WILL learn the material well. If not, then you're probably failing the course because you were expecting him to walk you through like a child.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	5	729670	7/23/11	I've taken a few classes with George. He's one of my favorite professors. I can be very difficult if you're not paying attention, but if you're genuinely interested in the material and pay close attention in class you can do well. He can be very strict, but he's very upfront about what he expects so as long as you deliver you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	0	Information Technology	402	1	1	2	3	729670	4/21/11	I had him for OS Scripting. touch class when you take it with this guy. He know's his stuff but doesn't know how to teach. The practicals and labs were extremely hard so if you don't know what you're doing before you get there, you better figure it out fast! ..And pretty much on your own :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	421	2	4	4	4	729670	1/24/11	My second time having this professor. Can be very hard, and won't post his PowerPoint slides anywhere, so pay attention in class. His labs are pretty lengthy, I find myself spending a lot of extra time completing the labs. As long as you pay attention in class and take GOOD notes (he allows cheat sheets on midterm & final), you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	0	Information Technology	402	1	1	1	5	729670	1/29/09	He knows his sutff well. However he will force you to do a lot of study on your own. He is a total jerk if questions are asked. Also exams and practicals are far harder then what he teaches in class. He is a very qualified as$hol3.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	421	1	5	4	3	729670	1/21/08	Omnipotent. Extremely knowledgeable about subject. He assigns a buttload of work and doesn't announce important dates. Lectures result in boredom and slides are not posted. Puts students on blast if they're sleeping or talking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	2	Information Technology	421	2	4	4	5	729670	1/10/07	He is one of the worst professor I've ever had. Very boring, lecture with slides but don't provide them for students. Extremely unhelpful, such as answering your questions with his own questions. Seem to have an ego problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Barido	3.7	1	Information Technology	421	4	3	3	2	729670	5/16/06	Love to grind on students who are not paying attention in class. Very dry and thought provoking stimulation lecture. Used powerpoint slides in his lectures but does not provide a copy to students so you are force to take your own notes. Very picky on the grading potion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Baroody	4.8	2	Business	760	2	4	5	4	1292881	1/24/13	Good professor with professional experience. Likes to help students. But he also demands.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Baroody	4.8	2	Business	106	1	5	5	5	1292881	6/3/09	WOW, what an interesting class. Entirely case based, but a must do class. This guy knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Baroody	4.8	2	Business	760	3	5	5	3	1292881	9/10/10	Great professor. Always willing to help students and guiding to find extra resources to acquire more knowedge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		5	5	5	5	118384	2/17/12	Do the work and you will get an a, its a helpful freshman class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	0	English		5	2	2	3	118384	11/20/11	Such a waste of a class. It is suppose to help freshman with college but it really only helped me set up my schedule for the next quarter. Barry goes so fast you never understand her not like you need to. i received a 99%. every time you miss a class its 1%. skip the maximum that you can!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	1	English		5	3	3	1	118384	11/10/11	Discovery is really, really easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		5	4	4	3	118384	11/13/08	She is a little confusing, but her class is easy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		5	5	5	5	118384	2/2/06	All I can say is she is an excellent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		4	5	4	2	118384	7/11/05	If, your grammar is a bit better, then you will be fine on that course. In addition, you better work a bit more than you expect, then you will be fine on for sure. You better go every conferences to improve the grade within an ease. Trust me, you will find that teacher so activity...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	0	English		4	1	1	1	118384	12/17/04	she just plain sucks and throws you to an unexpected surprise.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		4	5	4	3	118384	1/26/12	Although sometimes slightly unorganized, Professor Barry is a caring and helpful professor. Lovely woman.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	0	English		5	1	2	1	118384	11/10/11	you should not have to pay for this class. its a waste of money. but its an easy A. if possible avoid Barry, she is so confusing and very unorganized. she is very unclear and makes no logical sense ever. save your time and money- run away from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	1	English		1	2	3	2	118384	1/24/11	Just run away fom her please. Run fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	0	English		4	1	2	1	118384	10/21/08	UGH.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	2	English		1	5	5	5	118384	1/31/06	Shes great if you put enough effort then she will help you in anyway she can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Barry	3.4	1	English		1	3	3	3	118384	2/8/05	You'd have a lot of homework. You'd be stressed out!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science	411	2	5	5	5	1205358	4/20/11	Had for Electricity & Magnetism. This is a hard subject, but her teaching ability made it doable. Awesome teacher, clear on expectations. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	1	Science		2	2	3	4	1205358	3/10/10	poor teacher. very boring lectures. she complicates everything with her explanations. tosses a lot of problems and labs at you which you figure out yourself and never used mycourses to display grades or any material... i would not choose her as a teacher...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	4	1205358	5/27/09	Professor Barton is one of the best teachers in the RIT Physics department. She is very clear and her work is always useful even if it is somewhat hard. You will never have to ask "Why are we doing this?" If she is an option available to you in the Physics department, take it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science		3	3	4	4	1205358	11/13/08	Professor Barton does a good job explain the material but lacks on explaining how to actually use the material. In class labs can sometimes be tricky but she was usually able to help. Exam's were moderately hard and webassigns weren't fun at all...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	3	1205358	11/12/10	Best physics teacher EVER! Extremely helpful if you put in the effort, she's there to help you get the grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science		4	5	5	3	1205358	1/31/10	She is an excellent professor. She really knows exactly what she is talking about but is very down to earth. She is usually in her office before class and is very willing to help you on homework, give extensions, or offer more 'attempts' for Webassign. I would recommend her to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Barton	4.3	2	Science		4	4	4	3	1205358	1/22/09	Professor Barton makes physics kinda fun with her sense of humor. She could do a better job explaining some of the labs before we do them. The HW is tough and the exams are moderate
Rochester Institute of Technology	Reynold Bailey	4.3	2	Computer Science	233	4	5	5	3	1098086	8/20/10	His lectures are short and to the point, we almost always got out early. If you sit through his lectures you can ace every exam. He is approachable and always helpful. He isn't always the most interesting but he's easy to listen to and usually has some good stories to tell when he gets off topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Reynold Bailey	4.3	2	Computer Science	761	5	4	4	3	1098086	4/17/08	great guy, he is new but does a good job.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Reynold Bailey	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	5	1098086	1/26/08	Bailey wasn't quite as polished as he could be, but that's just because he's new; he's actually a really nice guy, grades fairly, and if you pay attention you can learn the material quite well. No homework, all notes can be downloaded from his site. He did sometimes lack some organization, but overall he's a good teacher and should be recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Reynold Bailey	4.3	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	3	1098086	8/5/10	Very nice guy, good professor. Always let us out an hour early. Very approachable. Taught with informative powerpoints that you could download later, which contained everything that was on the exams. No HW. Showed exactly where you lost points on projects. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Reynold Bailey	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	1098086	2/28/08	Really helpful if you ask for it, nice guy, knows his stuff. Just pay attention and you're fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	1	Psychology	441	4	3	2	5	785843	10/6/10	His voice is floaty and bland. In fact I can hear it drawling in the background right now as I rate him in his own class. He seems like a nice guy who means well, but seriously.. learn to hold your class's attention. He's just rambling. This is ridiculous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology	101	4	3	4	1	785843	5/5/09	Extremely boring lecture. Stands in the front and goes off the powerpoint for the whole two hours. Tests are difficult if you do not read through the assigned text.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology	210	5	5	5	4	785843	8/22/07	Really good teacher. Easy grader. Easy tests. Listen to the lecture and take notes. Lectures are based on the text completely so make sure to read as well. Really easy stuff so not hard to do a lot and get an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology		4	3	4	4	785843	12/7/06	easy, sometimes funny, nice guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology		5	4	4	5	785843	8/6/06	Boring teacher. Easy A. One last thing: he reads off powerpoints. If you ask him to describe something in further detail, he tells you that he doesn't know and to look it up in the text book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	0	Psychology		5	1	1	1	785843	12/20/05	What a bore! Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology	440	4	4	5	3	785843	8/18/09	Took his online child psychology course this summer. Everything was clearly laid out, which was good because the course required a lot of work. Weekly writing assignment, five timed exams and discussion posts/responses. Got an A but definitely had to work for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	0	Psychology		3	1	3	4	785843	5/28/08	Prof. Baker was a disappointing professor. While the class material can be interesting, he was more focused on getting information across than keeping things interesting. As an 8am, this class was torturously boring. The tests do come right from the book, so if you don't mind doing the work on your own, and not having a stimulating professor, enjoy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology		5	4	5	5	785843	3/2/07	Easy, multiple choice is easy and if you go to class not only do you not really need to read the book but you get bonus points on certain days just for being there. Hes fair and with the lowest test dropped you can screw up once. For our class there was NO cumulative final, amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	2	Psychology	449	5	4	5	5	785843	10/16/06	Really nice guy. Lectures are a little boring, but the class is so easy. Tests are fully from the book, nothing extra cause his powerpoints are straight from the book as well. Interesting class, just a little boring. Easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Baker	3.4	0	Psychology		3	2	2	1	785843	2/8/06	Boring as hell. Tests are based almost 100% off of the book. Doesn't take attendance, no final exam. Drops lowest test grade. Just go in to take the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tatyana Bakhmetyeva	4.5	2	History		4	5	4	5	1749212	9/21/12	Great professor. Can easily learn what she is teaching. Open lecture, has more of a debate type feel. Teaches from slides, so it can be a little confusing sometimes. Ask questions! Papers are a bit of a killer, but you can resubmit them for a better grade. The papers make up most of the grade for her classes. It is hard to earn less than a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		2	1	3	2	740453	1/31/13	Tests are fairly easy if you study for them hard enough, the mid-term and final are both open book but despite all of that, he's looking to take points off. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL! Whenever I email him a question all he says is "Ask your classmates" and his excuse is that we didn't pay attention or showed up to class. Overall, horrible prof. STAY AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		3	1	1	1	740453	9/6/12	Terrible that is all i have to say.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	270	5	4	4	3	740453	4/27/11	Had him for Business Software Apps which is just excel. Class is really easy and he does a fine job at keeping it that way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	201	5	5	5	3	740453	9/27/10	Great professor. Makes himself available outside of class, and is always willing to help. Tests are clear, and if you do the homework, you get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		3	4	4	3	740453	4/16/10	Had him for biz software apps. Class is boring, but have to attend to get good grades. Weekly hw assignments but they werent bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		5	3	5	3	740453	2/1/10	Looks like Jack from Lost :) Class is extremely easy, did not need to pay attention at all. Easiest A I've ever gotten.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		2	4	3	4	740453	2/11/08	Very difficult to pay attention in class, and though quizzes are easy the midterm was SO hard! it brought my grade from a can't get higher than a 93ish average toa can't get above a C. We'll see how the rest of the quarter goes...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		2	4	3	2	740453	10/12/07	This class can be challenging especially the quizzes! But if you do the homework andn dont understand something if you e-mail him he is very helpful. Overall i think that he is a good professor i have had worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	1	Business		2	3	3	2	740453	10/29/06	I took the class and he never came off as a bragger. However you will find that you are sailing a long in his class until the mid-term and be prepared because it will take you by surprise. You cant not pay attention in class you will fail... even if you do pay attention though its tough to study excel and access.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		3	1	1	5	740453	11/1/05	This professor does nothing but brag about himself and his "title". Does not like it when his class gets good grades, so makes them unfair. Even if you prove your point, he won't give you the points so your grade won't be high.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		5	5	5	5	740453	11/25/12	Easy, helpfull, and clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	270	4	4	5	3	740453	11/12/11	Dave is awesome. Very easy going when it comes to learning and doing work. Sense of humor can be a little dry, but he's still great. Very informative and good at teaching you exactly what you need to know.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business		3	5	5	4	740453	12/3/10	Awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		5	1	2	2	740453	9/22/10	He is actually tech support guy in the building. Class was easy , did not learn anything, used it as a filler class. He does not seem to know much and behaves much like any tech support guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	270	5	5	5	4	740453	2/19/10	It is a very easy A. Definitely take this class. He will tell you exactly what to expect on the 2 exams that he gives and as long as you do the homework and show up to class, you get credit for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	112	4	5	5	3	740453	2/28/08	Very helpful, responds to e-mails quicky, fair grading system
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	2	Business	101	5	4	4	2	740453	1/9/08	this class was very easy. he is a really nice guy let me take my final early so i could go home for a funeral
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	1	Business		5	3	3	4	740453	5/22/07	Class is very easy. Class lectures are very boring. The material can easily be taught in half the time. Homework is pass fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	1	Business		3	3	3	2	740453	10/21/06	boreing class, open book exams help, but not much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		1	1	1	3	740453	11/1/05	The main thing that you will know by the end of you r quarter with him is that "He is the network specialist you know..."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Ballard	3.3	0	Business		4	1	3	5	740453	10/28/05	This guy is not that wonderful of a person. He does nothing but brag about himself and his title instead of helping students obtain decent grades. In fact, he strives to make your grade as low as he can by making quizzes and tests tricky. If you have him, ALWAYS READ YOUR DIRECTIONS VERY CAREFULLY or you will fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Ballsun-Stanton	2.4	1	Information Technology		2	3	2	2	1724424	9/4/12	This professor does not make a fair and good teaching value. There were few labs at the end of quarter which he clearly said in whole class that we are not going to do them, he grades them zero instead of waiving them. He keeps going off the point during the lecture. Also there is too much hypocrite in this class, avoid him at all cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Ballsun-Stanton	2.4	2	Information Technology	320	5	4	4	4	1724424	5/27/12	Take your typical GCCIS student and make him a professor, and you are close to what he is like (likes table top games and lots of sarcastic humor, knowledgeable). The midterm and final were open everything (notes, textbooks, internet). Each HW was 1.15% so missing one or two was not devastating to your grade. Gives detailed help if asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Ballsun-Stanton	2.4	0	Information Technology	320	3	2	2	3	1724424	6/26/12	He likes philosophy and uses it costantly in his classes even though it is rarely relevant. He would often demand class participation, but then make you look and feel like an idiot in front of the entire class for answering a question wrong, then wonder why people would not participate in open dialog. Overall I would say avoid him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Ballsun-Stanton	2.4	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	1	1724424	5/16/12	Well, he is a new teacher at this time. Basically, learning SQL is should be easy with but should be reasonable to practise the assignments. He made exams way too difficult. He handed out a "retaken" test and fooled us that it was from homework and made us to grade our own homework otherwise a lot of point deducted. It doesn't sounds fair to me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		5	4	4	4	610136	4/11/13	Class was not bad. Lectures, interesting discussions, and the exam isn't bad. You just need to understand the concept that is on the study guides she gives to the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	3	610136	5/2/12	Elise is an awesome teacher! I am taking her for Intro to Psych and she is amazing! She is so nice and makes everything clear. She'll listen to student opinions and help with anything. She is bubbly and energetic. She loves what she does and is always smiling, making it easy to learn. She is wonderful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	4	5	610136	9/14/11	Dr. Banfield is a good instructor and her lectures are crystal clear. She incorporates movies in order for us to clearly comprehend the subject. However, her class isn't deaf friendly since she does not use powerpoint presentations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	210	5	4	4	5	610136	12/11/10	Took her for Intro to Psych and learned a lot. Her tests were very easy and as long as you paid attention in class, you can get an A. The tests were lecture based (no powerpoint) and there was no need to read the book. She gives ample examples in class to help remember the material. Definitely would suggest taking her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	210	3	4	5	5	610136	3/3/10	Had this professor for intro to psychology. Best choice ever. Simply amazing, crystal clear with what she wants for exams and lectures are interesting. Reasonable amount of chances for extra credit. Funny, and likes when the class is involved. Do yourself a favor and take banfield
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		4	5	5	1	610136	11/3/08	Pretty cool professor. Kind of awkward to talk to but overall a good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	610136	8/30/05	Possibly my favorit teacher in 3 years of RIT. Elements were clearly explained, tests were right from class and reading, and test answers were negotiable if a majority of the class had the wrong answer. She made me fall in love with Psych
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	5	610136	5/9/12	Had Elise for Intro to Psych and Social Psych. I absolutely adored her. She is bubbly and energetic, very friendly and approachable, she even lets you call her by her first name! Her classes are easy to understand, fun, interesting and completely lecture based. As long as you come to class and pay attention you are sure to get an A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	111	5	4	5	2	610136	11/10/11	Banefield is a discussion lecture a recording device great idea for this. You have a test around every 3 class days which is nice because you don't need to remember lots of material. She is the teacher you want for intro psyche. The book for her class not necessary at all just make sure you don't miss any classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	610136	1/25/11	Took her for Intro to Psych and then Social Psych the next quarter. Amazing teacher. Literally the clearest, most-willing to help teacher I have ever met. She allows you to ask questions through email, virtually anytime in-class, and through text! She will answer anything from a section you haven't covered yet to a section you covered 2 months ago.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	0	Psychology	400	2	1	1	3	610136	5/12/10	This professor is so vague when it comes to assignments and wording on text questions. The grade distribution doesn't make any sense either (10% of the grade is a 15 page paper). She is careless and dismissive when dealing with students and overall very unwilling to teach. Her lectures are dry and detail based, without much context or background
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		4	4	3	4	610136	11/22/09	Great professor, very helpful and very interesting. Tests were fair, and the final exam was given during week 10, which was nice. No papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology	514	4	5	5	4	610136	11/29/06	She's hot and flexible at most times. It's imperative that you pay attention to her lecture and read the materials from the book as well. She only hands out 4 quizzes and no midterm nor final exam. Quizzes are based on multiple choice and answer them CAREFULLY because it's graded via machine. She gives extra credit. MUST HAVE PROFESSOR.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elise Banfield	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	610136	5/2/05	VERY good teacher. Tests are multiple choice and are word for word examples she gives during class. And you will pay attention becasue she is very cute, you won't be dozing off in this one. She is very nice, helpful, and keeps everyone interested. I HIGHLY reccommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business		2	5	5	4	9106	8/16/12	Not the easiest class you'll take but, I would rate Barbato as the best Prof. I have ever had. Thought provoking, passionate and knowledgeable. Class is fun and deep. Prof. goes far beyond the typical cliche 'HR ethics crap' that you're quizzed on a computer about and goes into TRUE Ethics. A helpful class for life!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	0	Business		1	1	1	1	9106	7/9/11	worst class ever how hard could business ethics be. do not try and argue you point because you are always wrong his test are hard I read the book twice over and because it wasn't word for word on the test I got the question wrong do not take this class with him .
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	0	Business		1	1	1	1	9106	1/20/11	Worst professor I've ever had. Stuck with him with only one quarter left before graduation. Might have to withdraw and take 5 classes my last quarter. His tests are HARD and horrible, he must always be right, he takes half a quarter before talking about BUSINESS ethics...worst class ever...DO NOT TAKE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	438	2	4	4	1	9106	1/5/11	test are not fair understood the material but failed the tests. they are 10 questions with 3 questions in each. you have one hour to do it and its typed. you must get the question word for word to get it right hated the class because of the tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	102	4	5	5	4	9106	5/22/10	0102-438 Business Ethics. Wonderful professor with the great approach to teaching. I enjoyed his lectures and find them very helpful. It is hard to get a good grade without taking notes and attendance. His exams cover 75% of his lectures and the rest is reading. No multiple choice - only essay questions. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	211	3	5	5	3	9106	7/6/07	The best ever. A philosopher as well as a professor! He was very important in helping me form my ideas on several subjects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	204	1	4	3	3	9106	6/14/06	dont know yet
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business		4	5	5	4	9106	11/17/05	The course was entertaining but very repetive. Not good for an evening class but daytime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	0	Business		2	2	2	2	9106	11/16/05	Hard but fair
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	438	2	4	5	4	9106	8/9/12	I loved this class. Dr. Barbato was a great teacher. I learned so much about business ethics
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business		3	4	4	2	9106	1/26/11	A true philosopher who somehow manages to make Ethics interesting at 8 AM. Encourages debate and discussion. Make sure you read and do the journals, though!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	0	Business		1	1	1	1	9106	1/20/11	Worst professor I've ever had. Stuck with him with only one quarter left before graduation. Might have to withdraw and take 5 classes my last quarter. His tests are HARD and horrible, he must always be right, he takes half a quarter before talking about BUSINESS ethics...worst class ever...DO NOT TAKE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	1	Business	101	2	3	3	3	9106	11/4/10	Had him for business ethics, and it was not a cakewalk. Attendance is mandatory and essential to do well on the tests. Journals are also required before each class. Study the cases to do well on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	101	3	5	5	4	9106	5/11/10	Professor is insightful and genuinely cares about the progress of students. His wisdom and experience is beneficial to us all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business	551	3	5	4	2	9106	3/3/07	The overall class is easy but boring. Read the cases and you'll get 100% on the pop quizzes. The only thing, the tests are really hard. I suggest reading the book to study for them. However, this is a class that takes a lot of time outside of class due to projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business		2	5	5	4	9106	3/8/06	Tells good stories!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	0	Business		2	2	2	1	9106	11/17/05	This class was BORRRINNGGG!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Barbato	3.6	2	Business		3	5	4	NULL	9106	5/27/01	I took Org.Behavior and leadership. Doesnt like when you disagree with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication		4	5	5	3	1127020	3/6/13	Great professor! She's really interested in the topics and likes to keep students engaged.Reading quizzes are super easy as long as you keep up and pay attention. Group projects are also fairly easy as long as you contribute.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	1	Communication		5	3	3	2	1127020	7/11/11	Very friendly, easy-going, and a pretty easy grader. Had her for Public Speaking. As long as you show up and tried hard, she gave you a decent grade. I got an A in the class and I don't consider myself to be a great speaker. Students who complained about her, were students who didn't do their assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication		5	4	4	3	1127020	5/13/10	Professor Barone is really awesome. She is really lenient on grading and very helpful when needed. I recommend her especially if you arent good at public speaking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	0	Communication		4	2	2	3	1127020	10/22/09	Professor Barone was a terrible teacher. She was extremely unclear about assignments and due dates, unwilling to negotiate or reason with anyone, and seemed to not care if her students learned anything. She left half way through the quarter for health reasons, and the class became fully online. What good is an online persuasion class?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication		3	5	3	2	1127020	10/12/08	Not an easy A, but great teaching style, very relateable and down to earth. Had the 4 hour night class and we were NEVER kept until ten!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication		4	5	5	4	1127020	11/10/11	Blended class, scheduled from 6-10 but we never stayed past 8. Good teacher, easy going, assignments and discussion online were easy (as long as you made intelligent statements and backed them with terms from book you are good), quizzes online are easy if you use book, and the final is a group project that you have 8+ weeks to work on. Great class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	1	Communication	501	3	3	3	3	1127020	1/12/11	Her teaching style is learn by doing. Expect to give many speeches. Unfortunately, she does not teach how to write the speeches much at all. If you don't have the natural gift of speaking or writing speeches then the class will be a struggle. She also cancels class way too often which makes me upset that my money is being wasted.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication	400	5	5	5	3	1127020	4/2/10	As for her leaving, it was maternity leave. That's understandably unfortunate for you, but excusable and necessary. I took 3 classes with her and she is wonderful. One class was public speaking. She is nice, listens, and is approachable. I recommend Keri! She is a sweetheart. Just show up to class and do your work. Common sense.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	0	Communication	481	5	2	2	2	1127020	5/16/09	A bad professor. She did not care about having the class learn the material. She did not care to complete her work for the class on time. Not too helpful outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keri Barone	3.8	2	Communication		4	5	5	3	1127020	5/24/08	I had this prof for two classes and she was awesome. Very down to earth, easy to follow, and creative lecture style. Don't underestimate--classes are not cakewalks, but you will have fun doing the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	2	14398	1/2/13	Awesome professor..laid back environment in class. Tests are based on what he says, so if you take notes you're good. Article quizzes twice a week are two very easy letter grades if you just take the time to read the article.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	210	5	5	4	3	14398	8/15/12	Very friendly and laid back professor. Lectures can get a bit boring, though. Daily 3-question quizzes on the assigned reading, but nothing hard and the a lot of the reading is short and kind of interesting. Attendance is not mandatory. Both midterm and final are multiple choice. Also required to write an 8-page summary paper on a book he assigns.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	4	5	4	14398	1/29/12	Very interesting class discussions and really knows how to get the material across in ways that are understandable. Class is graded on 10 2 point quizzes, a final, and a midterm which aren't too bad. Highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	4	4	5	14398	11/9/11	Dr. Barry let me in the class even though it was full. He really cares about getting the information across and is always open to new opinions. The actual curriculum was really interesting, and the discussions are always great. We had an awesome guest speaker. I would take another class of his for sure
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	210	4	5	5	3	14398	10/18/11	easily one of the better liberal arts teachers i've had. if your a non liberal arts major TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM! he's clear at what he wants, and this course is fairly interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	5	14398	6/23/11	Brian is amazing. Intellectually stimulating and will make you want to attend class. His discussions are very insightful and easily relatable to college students. He is very smart and very good with words, as he is a brainiac and academic. His exams and assignments are easy. I guarantee you will want to take another class with him. Highly Recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	210	3	3	5	4	14398	1/21/11	I admit I like his lecture even though I hate his exams and not friendly to deaf students. Of course, His wife also teaches deaf students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	2	14398	7/15/10	Cool guy.. Keeps class discussion very interesting. Reading assignments are a breeze and count for a majority of the grade. Tests are pretty straightforward and simple as well. Take this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	444	4	5	4	4	14398	2/26/08	I had him for Social Psych and he was really good. Class was mostly discussions, so if you like that, he's great. You need to read the book on your own. There were 2 tests, and essay and quizzes on articles mostly every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	515	5	5	4	4	14398	10/30/07	He's one of the most understanding and interacting professors I've ever had in my 17 years of schooling.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	1	Social Science		3	4	2	4	14398	11/12/12	He is a nice guy, interesting at time, but his tests are awful and all but impossible to study for, phrasing questions in a manner that only he can understand, often looking for his opinion that may or may not have been stated in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	1	Social Science	210	5	3	3	1	14398	2/1/12	Took sociology with him, it's a very easy class! As long as you pay attention and jot the terms he writes, you'll be fine. Doesn't look like he takes attendance and doesn't mind if you're tardy. It's easy to fall asleep in the class though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	101	5	5	5	3	14398	1/9/12	TAKE A CLASS WITH PROF BARRY, you will not regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	1	Social Science	325	3	3	3	2	14398	10/29/11	Very mediocre professor. He brings up basic concepts and illustrates them well with examples, but none of it was very interesting. Doesn't seem to care too much about students learning though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	202	3	4	4	5	14398	10/11/11	Best Teacher I have had at RIT. He is so chill and so into what he teaches. Daily quizzes on articles that pertain to class discussions. Midterm and Final and one essay. I suggest taking him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	4	5	5	14398	1/27/11	I never thought that I would have a class that I would be thrilled to go to. If you can take Social Psychology of Religion with him, I am jealous.Sure other classes he teaches are great but this one was the best I ever had!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	4	5	1	14398	11/5/10	Great Teacher. Class is discussions about real life stuff that relates to students. Reading quizzes and tests are easy and count for most of the grade. The essay is long but only 20% and its summary/reaction
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	210	5	5	5	4	14398	3/9/08	Really easy teacher. Class is purely discussion. Talks about real stuff that relates to college students. Really good teacher if you need to fill a liberal arts credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	3	5	2	14398	1/19/08	Pretty much awesome. i really enjoyed his class. and actually switched my lib arts concentration to sociology so i can take more of his classes ><
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	3	14398	10/27/07	Pretty much amazing. hes a great teacher and really hope i get to be in another one of his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science	325	5	5	5	3	14398	10/24/07	Professor Barry is a great teacher. He is very interesting and his class was terrific. He uses movies as they are very relavent, he makes an effort to make the material easy to understand. His class was entertaining and not boring at all. He is open to most opinions but will challenge them and make sure that you can explain. Overall a great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	3	14398	2/27/06	I had Dr. Barry for Honors Sociology. It was an easy, but intriguing and interesting class with easy assignments. He graded really easy too and I got A's on almost everything. He's a really cool guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		3	5	5	3	14398	10/25/05	Awesome prof... one of my favorite liberal arts profs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	5	14398	9/2/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	4	14398	10/18/04	Barry is awesome! Talk in class, pay attention, read what he asks and write the paper and you're bound to do well! His in-class discussions are fun and entertaining and if you're the lest bit interested you'll never be bored!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	4	NULL	14398	9/10/03	Really cares about the subject, his students, etc. Class discussions are very interesting. His death and dying class is one of the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	1	Social Science		3	3	3	NULL	14398	10/2/01	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	3	14398	7/26/07	Barry is a great guy and he's highly engaging. Class discussions are full of life, even if they atart dull he'll play devil's advocate until they get going. Can't wait to take even more classes! =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		3	5	5	5	14398	11/17/05	Had him for 2 classes and he is great! Sometimes you get distracted because his socks don't match but otherwise his lectures are very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	5	14398	10/14/05	Amazing professor, best at RIT. Fun, interesting, insightful and funny. Made class worth attending.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	5	14398	11/17/04	Amazing Prof...best liberal arts teacher here....easy and entertaining! He actually cares about what he teaches and makes you want to be there
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		4	5	5	NULL	14398	5/8/04	The guy is a bit scruffy, but he is a really nice guy. He becomes very level with you in class. In class discussion is great, quizzes are super easy 2 questions and a bonus(only can get 100 though). Just do the readings and the paper. Take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	4	NULL	14398	8/24/02	yes, sexy he is not ... but overall I found him to be a great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Barry	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	NULL	14398	9/10/01	Class discussions instead of lectures keep things interesting, very nice guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	1	Mathematics	365	2	3	2	4	1217304	2/27/13	I didn't enjoy his class much. It seemed very unorganized and hectic. He didn't rush teaching, but he went back and forth on topics quite often. It was tough to keep track with what he was saying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics	101	3	5	3	3	1217304	10/25/10	Good teacher very interested in field.Very enthusiastic. Sometimes unclear in lecture but if you ask a question or go to office hours and makes sure you understand.Relatively easy grader.If your interested take him.If not, then pay very careful attention.Gives homework. Doesn't collect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	1	1217304	6/4/09	very cool nerdy guy. very interested in his field and if you have scrap if interest in theoretical mathematics take a class with him. likes to go on tangents about stuff that was WAY over my head but still interesting. tests right off of class examples. pay a little attention, and you will be good
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1217304	2/12/13	Professor Barth-Hart is one of the kindest, overall best professors I've ever had. He loves math and truly cares about each and every one of his students. Homeworks and exams are very fair. I would definitely recommend him to anybody for any class he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1217304	5/17/10	Excellent guy, very interesting but lecture can sometimes wear on you. Very helpful. One time I came in on a whim for some help and he gladly devoted the next 2.5 hours to helping me understand everything. Has a very good outlook on teaching and is very considerate. His tests are challenging but good for the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Barth-Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	1	1217304	11/30/08	Good teacher overall, sometimes the lecture can get a bit on the boring side, but other than that he presented the material in a clear and meaningful way. I got a D in discrete I yet I got a B in this class - he's very fair about grading things, also. Only 3 small "due" homework assignments the entire class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67393	7/4/11	For slackers, Basener is a dream. He only gave two tests but they were preceded by practice exams which were almost exactly the same. I did my homework and the practice exams and was easily awarded an A. He is also very enthusiastic about the subject. You could learn a lot extra if you wanted to. For hardcore nerds though, he is not a challenge :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics	253	5	5	5	5	67393	12/3/10	Prof. Basner is absolutely awesome. The best math professor at RIT. He knows exactly what he is teaching and truly loves math. I had him for Calc 1 and Calc 3, and in both classes, I needed to get over an 85% on my final to get an A in the class. Very clear and homeworks, can be long but are straight out of the book. Fun, great class
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67393	9/9/09	The BEST teacher I have ever had, and I really love two of my high school teachers to this day. Interesting and he tries to make the class fun. Calc II (which most people hate) was an absolute breeze for me because this man is so amazing. Take if you want to get a good grade and you will learn more from him than any other Calc teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67393	11/10/08	Dr. Basener is one of the best math teachers ever. He knows his stuff and can help with anything. He is friendly and i thoroughly enjoyed his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	5	67393	11/20/06	This guy is t he man, he didn't even show up to our final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	67393	11/9/05	AWESOME teacher. He's really funny, easy going, and if you have a problem, he's more then happy to help you with it. Like everyone has already said, his practice tests are almost exactly like the real ones. Definitely take him as a teacher if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	67393	5/1/05	Take him and you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	67393	4/27/05	Great teacher, easy tests, good amount of homework, but posted early and always due the same day of the week, so you can plan for it. Practice tests are just like the real ones!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	67393	1/31/05	Awesome mathematics teacher, lots of homework with hard problems, but the tests are very fair. Likes to clarify things with graphs, and occasional use of computer programs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	67393	11/11/04	Really nice guy, explains things perfectly. This was the first calc class that actually kept my attention and got me to understand everything. Taking him again for DiffEq since he's so helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	67393	5/3/11	Had him for calc III, and Diffy-Eq, very competent, entertaining, and easy-grading down-to earth guy. Many of the once weekly homeworks get extended,plus he goes over them in class before you hand them in. Tests are how they should be, both times i thought id get a B, but ended up with an A. Funny stories,can be distracted with random questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	2	67393	11/19/09	He is a very good teacher overall! He always puts up notes for all of us to make sure he understands. His quizzes and HW are really easy. The test are somewhat hard, but he is a fair grader. But, the final he gives is RIDICULOUSLY HARD so you must study for Calc for those who don't ever study for math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67393	11/11/08	This class was one of my favorites. Professor Basener truly tries to make the class interesting instead of simply lecturing about the endless complexities of calculus. While the class may have been difficult without having taken calculus in the past, it was not overly hard. The quizes and tests were only challenging without effort by the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	67393	1/31/07	Prof. Basener really loves what he does, and it shows. It's very easy to learn from him, and his class is very enjoyable. He frequently makes jokes, which makes class much easier. Overall, a fantastic teacher. I highly reccomend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67393	11/20/05	Wonderful teacher!.. everyone should have the opportunity to take his class. Makes learning enjoyable
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67393	6/20/05	Awesome teacher! Do the homework and look over the practice tests(which will be the real test with some numbers changed) and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67393	4/28/05	Smart, Funny, Easy, GREAT! Get him. Plain and simple.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67393	4/20/05	Great Teacher, very interesting and funny. Easy tests, a bit of homework but it is not worth much of your grade. He gives practice tests too!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67393	1/19/05	Had him for Calc IV and Diff Eq. Great teacher. Lots of hw due weekly, occasional quizes, and few exams. Hw is long, exams are fair. Copy everything he writes on the board, study, do the hw, go to class and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67393	10/27/04	Great guy, always willing to help out, great teacher. fair homework load, and not bad because each homework is only worth 1% of your grade. He even gives practice tests!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	1	67393	10/19/04	I had him for calc 2 (my seccond time around). Homework load isn't that bad, if you do it, you'll havea tough time getting lower than a B in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	NULL	67393	10/28/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Basener	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	NULL	67393	5/9/04	Good teacher who will take the time to explain something. He's difficult and easy at the same time. Easy because he doesn't thrive off of throwing curveballs at you, but hard, because of the amount of homework he assigns.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	0	Engineering	303	2	1	2	3	809415	1/29/09	He is undoubtedly the worst professor I've ever had.He gives zeros for homeworks that have minor errors in the headings and won't accept them if the are resubmitted.His lectures are very bland and usually unhelpful.When I ask him questions in class his explanations are usually unhelpful. I absolutely refuse to take him again for anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	0	Engineering	407	2	2	2	1	809415	12/2/07	Didn't get any corrected labs back...totally unacceptable from such an esteemed institution. Generally not very helpful. Stresses format, not content...ridiculous. MathCAD is horrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	1	Engineering	404	5	1	5	1	809415	9/25/06	All assignments are busy work and you are graded on formatting more than anything. I didnt get a single MET Lab I report back the entire quarter, or at any point for that matter. Basically, if you want to learn nothing, waste your time, but get a good grade, take a class with the Waxmaster. Other than that, save your parents money and transfer out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	0	Engineering	407	2	1	1	1	809415	12/2/07	Didn't get a single corrected report back in 10 weeks...totally unacceptable behavior. Stresses format, not content, which is ridiculous. MathCAD is horrible. Too much time must be wasted on how something looks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	2	Engineering	302	4	5	5	2	809415	10/22/07	Very professional, if you do the HW you will learn the material and get an A e-z if you work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phillip Batchelor	2.9	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	809415	2/9/06	Great professor. He teaches almost every MET class. I have had him every quarter since fall of freshman year. He's very clear and his homework assignments are relavent, and show up on tests and quizes. He loves to give partial credit. I have yet to receive anything below a B with him. He looks like the dude in the 6 flags commercial.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kimberly Batz	4.0	2	Engineering	101	4	4	4	5	1078558	12/18/07	Good Teacher, knows her stuff. This is just and intro coarse (no 3-d unless your class is fast and gets to it) She gives half a class lecture and the other half for lab time. She needs to command a bit more respect of the class but is very helpful for one on one questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Bauroth	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	5	1	952437	3/6/08	PERSONALITY: This professor is very friendly and tries to get the entire class involved. GRADING: If you don't get an A in this class you've done something terribly wrong. MISC: The concept of this class is terrible, but Josh makes it somewhat endurable. GRADE RECIEVED: A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Bauroth	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	952437	1/25/07	He tries to stimulate discussion in order to make this amazingly boring class seem more interesting. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. He takes the class more seriously than other FYE professors, and expects you to work. Work isn't difficult though, and getting an A in the class involves simply having a pulse. Overall grade: B+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Bauroth	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	952437	2/21/08	He's so nice! I love this guy, regardless of how pointless FYE is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	5	357185	1/21/13	Strong recommend against taking Bayliss in a programming class. Her lectures were just reading from vague slides that she didn't make, and her code is poorly documented and does not follow coding standards, making it harder to find help elsewhere.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	357185	11/5/12	I took an independent study with her that was a lot of fun. When ever I needed help she would explain what she thought was wrong and then how to start fixing it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	357185	11/5/12	Professor Bayliss made the material for game design easy to understand. She provided work-days so people would not fall behind on the projects and was willing to assist people who were struggling. The tests weren't too hard if you had been paying attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	357185	11/5/12	Professor Bayliss had fun assignments that included making client and server mods for Minecraft. She would always have a template for people to get help from and would be available for help otherwise. Very fun class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		4	2	5	5	357185	5/22/12	Bayliss had interesting material and showed several cool videos, but she seems very disconnected from her students, and a lot of the topics she discussed seemed irrelevant to things that we should be doing right now. A lot of the things she showed us are things we can't use for a while now, and seemed rather out of place.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	3	357185	10/25/11	Even though she isn't that great at programming classes, she does a decent job in design. She points out interesting facts about the physical design of games and all in all the class isn't that boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	357185	2/8/11	If you think she was a good teacher your wrong. She is cool as a person, but not as a teacher. She acts like she doesn't want to help students and when I did ask her anything she wouldn't really even answer anything. She would get annoyed and upset if I asked her a specific question and even told me t my face she wasn't going to help me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	222	2	1	2	5	357185	1/18/11	She hands out work and expects you to know how to do it without explanation. Hardly teaches any concepts in detail and just mumbles what has been written on her powerpoints. Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	2	4	357185	10/21/10	Had this teacher for Game Software Development II. The homework starts easy and gets a lot harder quickly. Is not interested in helping students solve problems. Talks too much about her MMO's. Lessons don't explain the hows and whys of the code we're learning. I feel like I know less about coding after taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	5	357185	4/14/10	GSD 2 was an awful experience with her as a teacher. She claims her teaching philosophy is 'students should figure it out on their own.' All that philosophy really means is that she doesn't want to teach. Her code was impossible to understand on projects/homework assignments and she was not very helpful when you came to her with a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	4	357185	11/10/12	I've been in several classes with Professor Bayliss and worked with her on a lot of other projects, and they've all been pleasant experiences. Her lectures admittedly don't work for everyone, but she's always willing to help if you ask for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	357185	11/5/12	Professor Bayliss met with my team on a weekly basis to ensure that the Independent Study was going well. She would offer help when we struggled with implementing something and was very positive about the work we were doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	357185	11/5/12	This class was a seminar that covered AI in games. Projects were client side and server side mods for Minecraft. She did a great job explaining all the AI techniques that different games use. The projects took some time to figure out, but that was a problem with the code base
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	3	357185	10/31/12	DSA1 is one of the more difficult courses in GDD and this prof does a good job at going over the content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	4	357185	12/5/11	Her "quizzes" and tests consist of only short/long answer questions, and/or essays(too much for an intro course, especially). She is extremely vague about what information tests & quizzes will be covering. She grades based on personal preference. Rude and awkward.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	5	357185	3/6/11	Professor Bayliss is one of the least helpful professors I have ever had. Not only was the class I took with her one of the most simple classes, but the manner in which she taught only made it seem like more of a joke. Her grading scheme was abyssal and unclear from the beginning, and her presence in the classroom felt more like a student teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	222	2	1	2	5	357185	1/18/11	Work is handed out and expected to be complete without explanation. Also, reading her code and having to work off of it is impossible, because her documentation is awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	357185	12/5/10	Bayliss may not be the greatest programming teacher, but design was lots of fun with her. You might have a little bit of difficulty if you know absolutely nothing about MMOs since that's all plays, but I personally don't think it matters much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	1	Computer Science	380	2	3	3	4	357185	10/16/10	Professor Baylis is a great teacher! Don't listen to all of the people who complain about here from GSD2, they didn't even have her! The IGM department just transfered a bunch of HW written by here for a different class into the curriculum. The class is very engaging and discussions are always allowed. Great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	222	2	1	2	5	357185	10/26/09	She did not teach anything. She talked about her forums and the MMO's she plays. She would always make the labbie help everyone while she just sat there and talked about w/e. She is very Unclear and gets off topic very easily. DOnt take this teacher unless you plan on teaching yourself everything. She is useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	3	4	357185	8/25/09	One of my least favorite teachers at RIT so far. I had her for GDD Fundamentals 1. She was rude, and when I asked for help on assignment she pointed me to the labbies (She didn't have any knowledge on how the software worked herself). Not a lenient teacher, and has a poor attitude. I did not feel like I was being treated as an adult in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	4	357185	11/3/08	Bayliss is a good teacher - she will go out of her way to help you if you need help. The class does go really fast sometimes, but all CS2 classes are like that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	218	2	2	2	3	357185	1/21/08	Instructions are always very unclear or vague.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science	217	3	5	4	4	357185	11/13/07	Jessica is a great person and a lot of fun to talk with, but when it comes to her teaching style, it's a bit hard to follow if you aren't already familiar with the subject. Of course, programming doesn't come naturally to me, so I may just have trouble understanding her because of that. Over all, though, I'd have to say I would recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	3	357185	10/22/07	In our 1-hour time block we spent the first few weeks spending half the class watching her laptop reboot. Examples are frequently wrong or don't compile. Can't give the right answer to her own test questions. Unclear test questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	5	357185	3/20/05	Good teacher with an obvious passion for the field (game development as well). She finds interesting ways to present the material without being too corny. Hard to contact outside of class, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	NULL	357185	5/19/04	Bayliss rocks. She's really nice and tries to make class interesting by making up real examples or just generally doing fun stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	380	3	2	2	2	357185	2/25/09	Unfair grading of game pitches. Spends much of class expounding useless definitions. Very unclear on requirements of assignments. Stubborn -- will not accept ideas that don't agree with her world view, no matter your logic. Generally only likes MMOs, so has little experience with other genres, which clearly impacts the direction of lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science	218	2	2	2	1	357185	2/26/08	OK teacher, shes nothing special. However, she is very vague in class and on the homework. Projects were a disaster. First one was too hard, second one the server went down so we could not test. Third one we had to set up our own server to test because she was away. Vague comments on labs, makes programming tough if you have no experience in it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	357185	11/21/07	Doesn't have a clue on teaching students JAVA. Expects you to know what to do even if you never did JAVA before. Ask for help and she'll refer you to the book. Maybe she doesn't know whats going on either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	4	357185	10/22/07	Unprepared for lectures, often seems confused and is unable to answer questions. Projects are hard and class time offers no information useful for them or the tests. Be prepared to teach yourself the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	357185	10/14/05	Great Professor, a lot of fun. Interesting too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Bayliss	3.0	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	5	357185	11/30/04	Very good teacher, but hearing about her bird got kind of annoying after a while.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	4	513074	3/27/13	Least helpful professor I've ever had. Forgot to post assignments and became frustrated and rude when students pointed out difficulties turning in assignments they had never received. Class with her is a waste of time and tuition.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		4	2	2	3	513074	10/7/12	One project requires students to 'lead the class' for at least an hour. This can be done individual or as a group. I found this project to be a disappointment to me as we pay quite a bit of money per class period to be there and I didn't get much out of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		5	1	3	2	513074	2/27/12	For being an ethics professor, this teacher is NOT at all ethical in grading- and the material is incredibly quirky. For example, one of our lectures was on the possibility of 9-11 conspiracy theories being true, and another was on Trolling (with a video on history of trolling from boing-boing taken as fact). Material is easy, but avoid this prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science	415	3	1	1	1	513074	2/6/11	Terrible teacher. Lectures are very boring, assignments are very poorly written and unclear and she is very lazy. She also doesn't really teach anything in her lectures anyway. Biggest waste of time I've ever had to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		4	2	2	5	513074	7/15/10	Incredibly dry lecture.. She reads off the slides and asks questions that no one knows the answer to, and if no one answers she will just stare at the class until someone says something. Promises grades will be delivered, then takes forever to post them. I really don't think she belongs in the classroom as she is deaf and can barely understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		5	1	3	2	513074	2/27/10	Returns grades very very slow and is unclear about every assignment. We're past week 11 and we only have maybe 40% of our grades!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	1	Computer Science	425	5	3	2	3	513074	9/28/09	Lectures are so boring! As far as I can tell I could just read the slides do the book readings and skip class, but attendance is required and various participation activities are sometimes done in class (which is part of your grade). Class subject is important, but overall class structure is lacking, she's not quite as organized as I would like.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science	455	4	2	2	1	513074	5/19/08	Professor Beaton is probably the worst professor at sparking any interest in the already boring subject of Needs Assessment, but she is really nice with grading. I finished with a 88.9 and she bumped me up to an A because I went everyday and participated.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	1	513074	12/2/04	EASIEST PROFESSOR EVER. SHow up to class do some quick studying and you get ur A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	2	Computer Science	415	4	5	5	3	513074	10/13/12	Note, also had for tech transfer. Prof Beaton is one of the few truly relatable professors I have seen on this campus. Each class was spent thinking, rather than absorbing, like most other classes. She truly cares about the students in her classes and tries to help to the best of her ability.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	1	513074	6/11/12	Took her a couple years ago and was the worst experience at RIT. Discussions had little to do with Ethics or had superficial coverage at the most. Spent 2 quarters fighting with her to get a final grade and ended up going to the department head. At the last minute, Beaton attempted to tell me I failed to turn in a final project. Got an A- on it?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science	415	5	2	2	1	513074	11/16/11	Most of your grade comes from papers you write, and two group presentations you have to do. She likes to be right all the time, and hate for students to disagree with her. Keep your mouth shut, agree with her even if you don?t, and do the papers. If you do all I have said, you will get an A in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		4	2	1	3	513074	11/2/10	Overall a pretty bad professor. Just read off of PowerPoint slides. Said she was going to post them but rarely did. She was never clear about what she wanted for assignments until after they were graded. Thankfully, the class was easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	0	Computer Science		5	2	2	3	513074	3/5/10	Very unclear, not prompt and dry in lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	1	Computer Science		4	4	1	4	513074	2/22/10	Very unclear about assignments and very dry lecture. Take with Scott!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	2	Computer Science		5	5	2	3	513074	11/3/08	No complaints, but extremely boring when she lectures. Usually you cannot hear her too well because she cannot hear herself talk. Pretty easy on grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	513074	2/22/05	EXCELLENT TEACHER!!!!!! Nice class setup and very fun! If theres a choice - definitely pick her for your class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Beaton	2.6	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	513074	11/28/04	Prof. Beaton is RIT's only deaf professor (excluding NTID i imagine). Freshman Seminar wasn't too hard, just had to do 1 project and some journal entries. No complaints really.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	1	Environmental Studies	212	5	4	2	4	1483436	2/17/12	She is a very accommodating professor who is willing to work with you if you need help or get behind. Her lectures are a little boring and she is not very clear. She was not clear on what the final CAP project was until it was almost due. But is an easy grader and it is hard not to do well in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies		3	1	1	3	1483436	1/24/12	She is very confusing all of the assignments where semi clear. A lot of emails did not help the clarity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	1	Environmental Studies		5	3	3	4	1483436	11/29/11	First day of the class she went over syllabus, its hard to understand her due to her accent. She makes the class seem a bit boring, she just talks for full 2 hours, some related to class some not, she does have a grading system for yourself to keep, you need to fill this out everytime you do or do not do the homework. She's easy !
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies		5	1	1	2	1483436	3/7/11	Hard to follow, had no idea what my grade was until they came after finals, due dates change often and are at inconvienent times. lectures often felt irrelevant, and the second half of the course felt like intro to SPSS. avoid if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies	212	4	2	1	2	1483436	10/14/10	Very unclear. Assigns projects and assignments with little clarification on what to do or how it relates to the class. Assigned 30+ pages of reading a night. A majority of the people in my class had absolutely no idea what was going on throughout the quarter. Lecture is super dry and she drones on for the full hour and 50 minutes. Definitely avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	1	Environmental Studies	212	4	3	2	2	1483436	1/26/12	It took a few weeks to get used to her accent. She presents a lot of information in one class, but there are no quizzes, tests, midterm or final. Grades came from projects, papers, and participation. She is willing to help and pushed a few due dates back. She has an interesting sense of humor and is very enthusiastic about her work. Easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies		3	1	1	2	1483436	12/5/11	She is by far the most incomprehensible professor I have ever had at RIT. Her organization and postings are chaos. Read the syllabus daily, otherwise you leave class and days later find out you have an assignment that was never mentioned. Deplorable lecture skills, reads straight off of ppt. Cuts students off when they speak to contribute.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies		2	1	1	1	1483436	4/6/11	awful awful her lectures seem sporadic with no real purpose. she throws out buzzwords without any context to the lecture. Essays are returned without any clarification as to what was done right or wrong. doesn't define what needs to be done for assignments until they are presented. also assignments are not handed back in time for fixing current wor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Becerra-Cordoba	1.7	0	Environmental Studies		4	1	1	2	1483436	2/7/11	Worst professor I have ever had at RIT. Thankfully she is only a visiting professor and won't taint our campus for much longer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Beck	4.3	2	Film	101	1	5	5	5	74401	6/12/08	In the first class, Jack stole my $100 textbook and set it on fire (IN CLASS!) as a promotional tool of some kind. He never paid me back, but I learned more from JB than I ever could from some old textbook. Heck, I learned more than I could have from an ancient scroll! Highly recommended!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Beck	4.3	2	Film		2	4	3	3	74401	8/30/05	Jack is interesting, kind of moody; grumpy one moment/joking around the next. He's not on the bottom of my favorites list, but definately not on the top.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Beck	4.3	2	Film		3	4	3	4	74401	12/19/04	Jack's classes can be full of hilarity. He's generally really friendly, and everyone likes him. Sometimes his grading and expectations are unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Beck	4.3	2	Film		4	4	5	NULL	74401	2/19/03	Jack is very friendly with students, and is also a somewhat easy prof.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	1	Electrical Engineering	250	3	3	2	4	1536594	11/11/12	I only had her for Assembly Lab. Even though she wasn't teaching the material, she was extremely helpful during lab to make sure that you knew the language, and helped if you had a problem. A lot of bad reviews seem to focus on her lectures, but she does know what she is talking about, so if you can take her for lab, do so.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	1	Electrical Engineering		4	3	3	4	1536594	11/18/11	Definitely not as bad as her previous reviews, maybe she was bad at teaching electrical stuff - I don't know - but she was competent in Assembly Language and taught pretty well. A little difficult to understand at first, but got easier after a few weeks. Allowed a quiz retake when the class didn't do well on the first one, and a pretty fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	1	Electrical Engineering	250	4	4	2	5	1536594	11/17/11	If you are willing to ask questions and work hard, she can be very helpful. She knows what she's doing and is willing to go out of her way to help you understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1536594	8/8/11	everything that you need to know has already be said
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	2	Electrical Engineering	342	3	4	3	4	1536594	7/18/11	If you do the work and ask for help when you need it. You will see that she is a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	1	1536594	5/11/11	Completely terrible in every sense of the word. I'm pretty sure that the average student will know more about the topic BEFORE taking a class with her than they will AFTER.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1536594	4/24/11	Avoid, avoid, avoid. I have not met a single student that would ever take her as a teacher again. the other comments so true in every way. Nice, but can NOT teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1536594	3/4/11	She can't teach she uses other professors material but then makes her own test that don't relate to what she's TRIED to teach. If at all possible void her class. If you can't go to another section that she's not teach, for lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering	303	1	1	2	4	1536594	1/31/11	Avoid. At. All. Costs. I don't know why she's still allowed to be teaching here but she is absolutely terrible. She is vague, doesn't answer questions in any useful manner, and rarely covers the material you'll see on her tests and quizzes. (applies to her Electronics and Microcomputers classes)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	5	4	1536594	6/9/12	Becker-Gomez truly cares about how students do in class. She encourages participation and wants everyone to fully understand topics. Questions are answered fully. She stresses group work and working together coherently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	2	Electrical Engineering	250	5	5	5	5	1536594	11/17/11	coolest professor ever, goes out of the way to help and makes sure you understand the material. Would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	1	Electrical Engineering		4	3	3	5	1536594	11/17/11	I bit hard to understand but a good and knowledgeable professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	4	1536594	8/2/11	I went for help did the work and asked question during class and still came out more confused than when I went in. The only people that passed her class literally memorized the book or guessed answers and even then barely passed. I'm she's a nice person but as far as professors go I wouldn't take a class with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	4	1536594	6/28/11	Some professors you can tell that they know what there talking about but just can't teach. She isn't one of them she can't teach and I think she has no clue on what she's doing. She uses other peoples material and changes grade so she doesn't look like a failure as a teacher. You must avoid her at all cost unless you like being confused and failing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1536594	5/9/11	Extremely Unreceptive to questions and does nothing but read from a paper she prepared ahead of class. Very nice lady but way to strict grading, and very unclear. Students come out of lecture more confused than before entering. Taught myself whole class from the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	5	1536594	3/23/11	Honestly the worst professor I have come across in my life. You really must avoid, half of the time it really doesn't seem like she even knows what she's talking about, as she just reads from someone else's paper. Good luck to anyone who is unfortunate to have her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Becker-Gomez	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1536594	2/18/11	Professor Becker is a nice lady, but she can NOT teach...at ALL. In order to learn anything you will have to read the text book but even that wont guarantee anything because getting a 30 on at least one of her test will be in your future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Beeson Garcia	2.8	2	Political Science		4	4	3	2	1483387	5/19/11	Lecture can be dull (even he gets bored with it) but he empathizes with the hard life of a student, being a recent grad himself. He does hand out slides but not everything is on there, does warn you that things he mentions but aren't on the slides are on quizzes/test and is very flexible on hours / grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Beeson Garcia	2.8	0	Political Science		1	2	2	3	1483387	10/14/10	Class is very difficult to follow. No textbook, three books on theories that are refered to during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Baschnagel	4.5	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	1437407	6/6/11	He can be a little longwinded, but explains concepts really well and answers questions. Plus he's nice to look at...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Batabyal	5.0	2	Economics	511	2	5	5	4	1207924	11/17/12	Very difficult class, lots of material. Doesn't use textbook, teaches you from his notes. Fantastic professor, but isn't easy. Poses challenging questions that make you think. Don't be surprised if you come out with a C. One of the hardest Econ classes available, so expect to work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Batabyal	5.0	2	Economics	511	5	5	5	5	1207924	11/17/08	great professor. I took an International Trade and Finance with him. Very comprehensive. Homeworks are easy. Exam questions are from homework exercises. Piece of Cake. Don't need the book, but it is better to have it and sometimes read it. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		1	5	5	5	964912	5/20/10	I like Skip, he's a great teacher. He's very deaf friendly and I liked the fact that he would put closed captioning on for them, that what makes him a great teacher. Take him, it's really worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		3	5	5	5	964912	3/4/10	Skip is the man, take him! His essays are tough but very exciting to write! Take him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		1	1	1	1	964912	3/2/10	English teacher as a Film Teacher? What?? Take Carageorge istead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		1	1	1	1	964912	2/27/10	skip is a nice guy, but he only talks about himself 24/7 and we get to write about our thoughts, but he judges too harshly. avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		4	5	5	5	964912	10/23/09	He's a good professor! Very easygoing, fun, and extremely helpful. Likes to make students feel good about themselves and make more inspiring work. Would definitely recommend you to take him if you got the chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		4	5	4	5	964912	2/17/09	Skip is a god. He knows all there is to know about film.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	1	Film		5	3	2	3	964912	3/24/08	Bit of a nut but wants to see everyone do well. Likely to take you out for a beer after class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		2	1	2	3	964912	3/31/10	Lecture was useless other than to hand in the essay which was due. I always paid attention and sat in the front row every class but I always walked out each day questioning if I actually learned anything. Essays can be hard, strict grader, final is ridiculously easy. I can't say I'd recommend him but he certainly is a cool dude, very Jeff Bridges.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		1	1	1	1	964912	3/3/10	Great man, horrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		2	2	1	1	964912	2/28/10	He can be cool, but does not like those live action films, he only likes odd animation films which means that he will fail you on your live action. Take other teachers for this particular class. Don't bother.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	0	Film		2	2	1	1	964912	2/26/10	He is a horrible professor. Doesn't agree with students' opinions. Avoid taking him for Film Language, and take other classes with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		5	4	4	5	964912	6/12/09	Skip is perhaps one of my favorite teachers ever. His class is easy because he gives you the freedom to experiment and do what you want. He always has positive comments about everything and helpful criticism. Plus, his STORIES ARE AMAZING. I mean, how often to you get hear about filming in the arctic with temperatures way below zero? Totally cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film		4	5	5	5	964912	6/11/08	Good class...you'll enjoy it and learn alot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Skip Battaglia	3.1	2	Film	200	4	4	5	5	964912	7/9/07	Skip is a fun Professor. A little wacky and usually a little tipsy...? Generally accepting of alot of different film/animation styles. A good professor and alot of fun in class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Baumhauer	4.5	2	Business	152	5	5	5	1	1726760	1/8/13	I was in Ted's Experiential Games class at Nazareth, and it was great! It consisted of us playing over 70 games over the course of the semester. Ted's a really fun guy. He messes with the students sometimes, but it's all in good fun; he'll usually have a good laugh if the student has a good comeback. Take a class with him if you need a PE credit!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Baumhauer	4.5	2	Business	320	4	4	3	2	1726760	5/24/12	Ted is a cool guy. Class consists of game playing to get the point across. You develop a cool closeness with your classmates. Ted has a unique outlook on grading so be sure to study his material and take notes. If he offers bonus homework, do it. I'd take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Baumhauer	4.5	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1726760	10/18/12	Ted was a great teacher. Played lots of games to illustrate his points. Would reccomend to anyone
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	5	67391	10/22/12	Overall solid teacher. An 83 is considered an A in his grading system. Uses part of class time to go over homework and clear up any questions. Has a slight accent, but doesn't severely inhibit class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics	282	3	3	2	4	67391	5/25/12	Homework is assigned and due almost every class. Tests are hard, but graded fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67391	5/13/12	Dr. Bautista has been one of the greatest math teachers I have come across. He has incredible knowledge in the subject, and has very high expectations (which help incredibly in this course, and in later math courses). I highly recommend his classes. The class was not easy, but by the end, you will know Calculus better than 99% other calc students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	331	1	1	2	3	67391	2/24/12	Professor Bautista is easily the worst teacher I've had at RIT. Assigns homework, changes it night before its due, gives ridiculously long assignments. Gives review sheets for exams but they don't help because the exams are all different style questions. Talks to the class in a condescending tone the entire time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	345	2	1	1	2	67391	2/9/12	He is an overzealous professor that does spend time belittling students if they ask questions. Spend more time fooling around than teaching the subject. Very bad teaching style, give lots of homework on subject that we just went over during the last 5 mins of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	5	2	67391	3/7/11	Gives a lot of homework, but by the end, you know the material amazingly well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	283	2	3	4	5	67391	1/12/11	Although he seems like a very bad professor, I'm experiencing one worse now and would kill to have had him again for Multi-Var. If he thinks your question is stupid he pretty much makes fun of you, but he definitely harps on DEFINITIONS! If you pay attention to strict details and know algebra well you will do well in his class. A = 85%(his curve)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	3	67391	10/25/10	He is very hard. I took this class in high school and did fine but it seems harder now just one year later. When asked questions, he makes you feel even dumber. I suggest seeing him in office hours where he is more friendly even though he appears un-welcoming. I feel he isnt too thrilled with NTID students unfortunately. Look at other teachers too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	283	1	2	1	3	67391	10/18/10	This professor was useless and I would learn more just reading the textbook. In class he is for the most part a useless jerk, picking on students who have a hard time with the material. The tests are impossible unless you are gifted at calculus, a pretty poor professor for a class every student regardless of their previous class level has to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	1	67391	8/12/10	Not a very good professor. I learn best through examples & the only examples he does are the hw questions..Which he often changes the day before they are "due". However, he does not collect them. Does not answer questions well, gives the same answer repeatedly even if you still don't understand what he is trying to say.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	67391	10/16/12	Here is the thing about Bautista, he is one of the mist intelligent teachers i have ever had, and he teaches from the ground up, no the top down. As a result, he goes through things quickly but if you can keep up you will understand why you are doing what your doing. He can be rude if you ask a question he has already answered so try to avoid that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	4	67391	5/21/12	Bautista knows his stuff very well. Only way you will get anywhere in his class is asking a solid amount of questions and do all of the homework thoroughly. He is not an easy grader or test giver. His tests seem to expect you to have mastered the subject, or close to it. I don't like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	331	1	1	1	2	67391	3/5/12	Worst teacher I have ever had at RIT. Assign homework due for the following day and randomly add new questions at the last minutes. Homework and quizzes are totally unrelated to what's going to be on the exam. Has to spend hours explaining the homework rather than doing a good job teaching the subject in the first place.would not recommend,he's Bad
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67391	2/14/12	Took him for matrix and boundary value problems. He is very smart but doesn't know how to communicate effectively and clear if you aren't willing to learn more out side the class than in you will not do good. Simply don't take him if you want a good grade n not work you behind off. And he give allot of homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	4	67391	3/14/11	Didn't learn anything. Took class with new prof. I learned more in the first 20 min than in 3 weeks of his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	67391	1/27/11	He doesnt actually have solutions to his HW.So how were supposed to know if were doing the HW right, is beyond me. He spends the first half hour taking questions but he wont go over evry problem. NOT 1 PERSON FINISHED HIS TESTS IN THE 1.5 HRS HE GIVES!!They are outrageous!! He gives stupid labs in Maplesoft which is the most WORTHLESS software EVER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics	283	3	3	3	4	67391	11/2/10	Proj.Based Calc III: As long as you can get over the fact that he's a pompous **** who sucks at conveying things and enjoys belittling you when you ask questions, you'll do fine. Often homework was thrown in at the last minute. Exams were tough, only 55min for ~8-10 problems but there was an auto ~10% curve. also, he has a slight accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	283	1	1	1	1	67391	10/19/10	This guy was just awful. Don't ever ask him a question, because not only will he not answer it, he will tear into you for 10 minutes over incredibly minute details, and his goal is to make you feel as terrible as possible that you don't know calculus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	283	1	1	1	1	67391	10/17/10	This guy is a complete toolbox. He is probably the worst teacher at RIT, and can not pronounce his H's. ex. 4/3 translates to 4 turds.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics	318	2	2	3	3	67391	7/14/10	He is not a very good teacher. I learn well from a lot of examples which he does not do a lot of. Some homework material was nothing like what we did in the class before the material was assigned. Focuses a ton on theory but can get very confusing/confused with himself when he lectures. Treats me like a child and gets mad when I ask him questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	305	4	3	4	4	67391	1/20/10	He's a very nice guy... and his class is mad laid back, he spends the first hour of every class going over homework making sure everyone understands what's going down... and his grading system is 85 or higher is an A, 70-84 B, 60-70 C 60-50 D, so it's pretty easy to get at least an A!...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	2	67391	5/19/09	Extremely difficult class. Homework does not match lectures and does not cover what is on the tests. Tests are extrememly difficult 5 question tests. Partial credit on a 20 point problem in usually 20 points or 2 points. Not clear at what must be known for exam and demeans those who asks questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	305	2	4	4	3	67391	3/17/09	He really doesn't deserve such bad ratings. His tests are no joke and he's a pretty boring lecturer but he's very friendly and approachable, and if you ask for clarification he's good at explaining. I expected the worst but he turned out to be a decent professor. If you are willing to put forth some effort you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67391	9/11/07	This is perhaps one of the worst teachers that I have ever had. You can hardly understand a word he says. He moves way too fast through material and is never clear about homework assignments.He gives online and book work with some problems in both, and got mad when asked about it. He puts students down for being wrong. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67391	11/29/06	Sadist who hates students. I got straight A's in my entire college career, except for Bautista's calc class. 100 pages of material, 5 questions on test. Miss two, you fail. So sorry. Difficult to understand if not from southest asia. Good luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	712	3	4	4	4	67391	2/12/06	Despite many students' negative attitudes toward this man, I must say that I learned a lot in his class. He was very helpful when I went to his office with questions. He challenges his students and I believe that may be why some don't appreciate him, but being challenged is the best way to learn higher level mathematics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	306	1	4	3	3	67391	2/3/05	Knew the material through and through, but often had trouble conveying this knowledge to the students ... he had a tendency to face the board while he was speaking, and he didn't speak very loudly, so he was rather tough to understand ... I did like that he gave weekly quizzes to keep you up to spee
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	67391	10/22/04	How well you do in his class is directly proportional to the amount of work you're willing to do. I personally LOVE this teacher. He's NOT unwilling to help, unlike everyone has said here. Maybe he's just gotten better over the last year, but I am looking forward to taking calc II with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	NULL	67391	4/10/04	Just Plain Horrible. Extremely defensive about Questions. He actually made 4 girls cry in class. Over half the class revolted and went to the department head about him, which only resulted in slight, if any, improvement. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	NULL	67391	12/20/03	If you listen to the man, he knows what hes talkin about
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	5	67391	8/10/09	Great professor. Assigns homework for submission, but goes over homework questions in class before he collects them so you can finish the assignment in class. Tests were challenging as they should be in major league math. Very helpful. Teaches clearly. Organized. He has fun teaching. Projects are difficult as expected, but not graded harshly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	283	2	5	3	4	67391	4/28/09	Good at explaining things, but a strict teacher and hard grader. Get ready for a lot of work if you take him. Still, he's very entertaining and makes sure students understand the material. He's also very helpful outside of the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	67391	7/29/08	Plays unfavorites (as in he chooses someone he hates a lot) Demeans people who ask questions. Seems to enjoy ripping a student apart for mistakes or doing things differently than him. Tests are unfair (students get A's on all the quizes leading up to the test, do well on the homework, and understand the material, but fail the test. doesn't add up)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics	272	1	2	2	1	67391	4/11/07	This professor does not teach the material very well at all. There are students in my class who have already taken Calc B and need to retake the class, and they find it difficult. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics	282	2	4	4	5	67391	11/10/06	Homework is always collected; quizzes every week in class (1) and online (1); tests are challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67391	10/24/05	Stay AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67391	11/14/04	He is a hard teacher, but A extremely good one. He pushes u to do better. Just do the work and u will be fine. He knows his stuff. The only questions I c him poke fun at, dumb questions that dont make sense. It really depends on what you ask.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67391	8/9/04	the best math teacher ive ever had. he knows his stuff and if youre willing to listen and work outside of class, youll have an A. btw, he grades on a curve, 85+ is an A, 70+ is a B, and so on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	NULL	67391	2/11/04	People **** way too much about this guy. He's easily one of the best math teachers i've ever had. He knows what he'd doing and is willing to answer questions. His class is difficult, but when you're done, you'll know the subject better than most.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	NULL	67391	12/16/03	Horrible teacher. Very unclear in examples. Does not help when students ask questions. Stay far away from this man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67391	7/15/03	Is very harsh, believes that partial credit should hurt. It's his way or the wrong way.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	NULL	67391	2/11/03	If you don't get it...he won't try to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	NULL	67391	6/12/03	Unclear in speech and downright hostile to people who ask questions. Every day I went to class I died a little more on the inside.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maurino Bautista	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	NULL	67391	5/4/03	Avoid like the plague
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		5	1	3	3	991710	3/27/13	Half the students in my Imagery in Design class argued with her and gave her attitude throughout and the same half disputed their grades and said she was horrible, wonder why! She is a nice person, just nod and do whatever she tells you to do and be nice and listen. Doesn't post any grades throughout the semester, you only find out at the very end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		4	4	3	5	991710	5/2/12	The people who hate on deb on here are the students who don't turn in their work on time or don't do what she asks. It's not that hard to follow directions and to be professional. She's a very caring woman who asks of respect. The only downfall of her is she can be vague, but she is always always always there for extra help and has great intentions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design	404	2	2	2	3	991710	3/7/12	Although knowledgeable in her major. She can be very vague and omit requirements in lecture. She does seem to play favorites. She is quick to think someone is insulting her when they intend not to. Basically dont get on her bad side and follow directions to a T.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	2	1	4	991710	2/5/12	Had her for Imagery in Design. She constantly changed assignment requirements. She played favorites and let them break the rules, while holding everyone else to guidelines. She talks in circles and never helps, unless you are her favorite. I found this class beyond frustrating and we didn't even use the supplies she insisted that we needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		3	4	4	5	991710	10/13/11	although she has only good intentions, she talks too much and over explains minute details. She starts off by giving you specific tasks but takes 2 weeks before she actually tells you what the project is. just be punctual and polite and put in genuine effort and you'll do fine but if possible try and get a different professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		5	5	3	3	991710	1/27/11	Had her for Imagery and Design and cannot wait to take another one of her course. Professor Beardslee is by far my favorite professor here. She can talk, A LOT, but she is very helpful and extremely sensitive to individuals and their individual needs and situations. A wonderful prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design	101	1	4	4	5	991710	6/9/10	Yes, she's hard on her students, but I don't think that she deserves some of the harsh criticisms listed here. She expects her students to complete assignments on time, and with a high degree of skill... is that so wrong? At the end of the day, I learned a lot in her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	1	1	1	991710	12/22/09	How is it possible that this professor is still in teaching in the Graduate Graphic Design program? She's horrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design	301	1	1	1	4	991710	10/21/09	She is the worst teacher I've had at RIT. Never fully explains what you're doing, loves to hear herself talk. Set the tables up to match the grid on the floor before every class. She has no sense of design whatsoever. The fact that she is a graduate Graphic Design professor makes me not want to apply to grad school here. Make her leave RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	1	1	1	991710	4/8/09	Intolerable... Sets up a double standard for being on time. Expects Students to be punctual and professional while she is often late herself. Doesn't know what she is talking about at all and is painfully VAGUE about everything. Rapport with students is extremely poor due to the face that she doesn't email except at work. Give the school a bad rep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		1	5	5	5	991710	5/23/12	I agree with positive comments here. Prof. is really clear - but you have to pay attention and follow the proj. parts and details. Her assignments are pretty unusual and she shares expert design things that you don't know about yet- that's why it confuses some people. If you want great work take her classes. She's a pro and a nice person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		1	5	5	5	991710	3/23/12	If you tune into project requirements and come prepared, all is well. It's really frustrating to have peers in class slack off or half listen and then complain later about grades or playing favorites. Prof. Beardslee isn't an easy grader. Work hard and you'll have strong, unusual portfolio pcs. Don't whine -she's one of the best profs to choose.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		4	1	1	1	991710	2/16/12	I had her for Environmental Design class and I regretted taking the class with her. She thinks she know her stuff , but she does not. If you want to have awesome concepts work for your portfolio, take someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		1	5	4	3	991710	12/15/11	Prof Beardslee is one of the best teachers I've had at the two colleges I've attended. She cares a lot and helps us find out about things in the world that we didn't know about. Sometimes I don't get the process and ideas at first - but it really helps me improve my design skills. Tough grader (this makes some students mad), but you really earn it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		5	1	1	5	991710	9/6/11	This instructor is not worth your time or money. She will talk for a long time and explain nothing. Her grading will depend entirely on whether she likes you. If you want a worth-while class experience, take a different instructor. I CAN NOT stress that enough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	2	Design		3	4	3	3	991710	11/4/10	She was an extremely helpful professor, as well as professional. She has great insights and cares about her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		5	1	1	4	991710	4/21/10	The most frustrating academic experience of my life. Can't get away from her if you are in Graduate Graphic Design as she is the coordinator and chief advisor. Runs it like North Korea, dictatorially?no dissenting, alternative voices permitted. We are paying for her cushy tenured job. Legacy will be she single handedly ruined the program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	1	1	5	991710	10/25/09	Really? Is this for real? How is this woman still teaching... and why is she teaching at the college level? She'd make a great nursery school teacher, but is a LOUSY professor. Avoid her if you want to have a career when you're done at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		3	1	1	5	991710	5/26/09	Are you kidding? How can this woman still be teaching here? She is quite possibly the worst teacher ever... seriously. She is just impossible, and persnickety. Do yourself a favor and change to CGD right away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	1	Design		2	2	3	5	991710	11/18/08	She is the stereotype that gives the Art School a bad name. Talks with her hands, and wants you to "feel the artwork" if thats your thing, have fun. She graded impossibly hard as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		4	1	1	1	991710	10/17/08	useless.She makes the class more about her and her feeling satisfied with how much attention she gets from the students instead of teaching something worthwhile. Projects were so basic that you were not pushed at all, except to your patience level because she is constantly belittling ppl. She also told me how awful an idea studying abroad would be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	1	1	1	991710	2/4/08	Wow. I dont even know how i survived this woman. She doesn't know anything and doesn't know how to teach what she is supposed to. VERY VAGUE on projects as well with everything else. Do not take her class if you know what's good for you. Class totally worthless to my education and i consider it a waste of my time and money.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	2	2	3	991710	12/10/07	i'm going to avoid her like the plague for my remaining years at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	1	Design		4	1	4	1	991710	7/25/08	This class was a total waste of time and money....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Beardslee	2.3	0	Design		1	1	1	4	991710	12/29/07	She gets pissed if you look at her wrong. Levels room during class time to email in her office ... is that a new form of teaching. If there because no one wants to run the GD grad program. Very hard to get a long with ... has no real world design experience since the 80's ... come on.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Duane Beck	5.0	2	Packaging Science	420	5	5	5	5	1746329	9/5/12	Great Professor ! Two thumbs up, He teaches with Knowledge and his own experiences. Homework Is easy make sure you do it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics		4	5	5	2	1705584	4/7/13	really good I highly recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics		4	5	5	5	1705584	2/13/13	Dude is an awesome teacher, he answers questions, hw correlates with class work. He wants to make sure you understand the material. Will answer questions. Quizzes and test aren't bad if you go to class and do hw. He makes horrible jokes, but I'm fine with that. I really wish he was teaching the transition physics course next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics	101	4	5	5	3	1705584	7/4/12	Really enjoyed the way he taught the course. If you visit during office hours he WILL make sure you understand the material before leaving. It's not often you find a professor who is actually willing to teach the students for the students sake. A lot of professors at RIT will just talk about the material, this man lives and breathes the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics		4	5	4	4	1705584	4/3/12	Willing to help via email or during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics	101	3	5	4	3	1705584	4/2/12	Smart guy. Young, so he isn't old like most profs. Good looking, doesn't hurt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics		5	5	5	1	1705584	2/19/13	Seriously the best god damn physics teacher ever. His beard is full of answers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics	312	2	4	4	3	1705584	11/11/12	Quite helpful in class, makes sure you know the material. Homeworks are kind of sporadic, and they're Mastering Physics as well, so it's a little unintuitive. Very helpful in labs, if you have questions, he'll answer them. For the RIT Physics Department, he's one of the rare good professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics	211	4	5	5	4	1705584	5/18/12	He's a damn good teacher, always clear and he really shows you how to solve the problem and he doesn't go on mindless babbles about theory and he just shows you how to do it. He's really flexible and always available during office hours and he's so easy to work with. I plan on taking this teacher again for future physic classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Becker	4.7	2	Physics		3	4	4	3	1705584	4/3/12	Homework goes with class work. Test wasn't bad. Quizzes are fine if you pay attention and do the homework. Not half bad, even if I do hate physics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature	201	4	5	5	3	295907	12/10/06	Everything you wanted in a class and didn't know it. Take any of his classes, you will be glad you did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		4	5	5	3	295907	1/27/06	Amazing prof.!! Really helps you become a better writer, and encourages you to be honest with your writing! Applies things that relate to college students to keep it interesting... def. a prof you can connect with!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	5	5	5	295907	10/16/05	He's funny, understanding, fun and possibly one of the best teachers at RIT. I MISS TODD!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		4	5	5	1	295907	7/14/05	i love todd! he is a great teacher and he's kinda hot for his age. he is a genuinely interesting person and the class only lasts like half an hour, and hour at the most
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	5	5	1	295907	3/15/05	Todd Beers is the best professor to have for Writing and Lit. I never wanted to miss a class. You do the work, you turn it in, you get an A. Simple as that!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	4	5	3	295907	9/16/04	Very amusing teacher, class doesn't run very long (usually only lasts 1/4 of the allotted time). Missing this class leaves a void in your soul.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	5	5	5	295907	4/29/06	great professor, helpful comments, lets you explore your writing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		4	5	4	5	295907	10/25/05	By far the one of the best teachers at rit. He's down to earth, and understands that we have more important things in life then his class. But he makes class so much fun that you don't want to miss it. He was a major part in me switching my majors from what I though was practical to what I really wanted to do (biotech to photo). I love and miss Todd!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	5	4	4	295907	9/4/05	Todd Beers class was not only fun, short, and easy, but I actually learned how to write. It was eye opening. It was everything a class should be. Short, to the point, unpredictable, and in the end I got a lot out of it. I salute you Todd!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		5	5	5	2	295907	7/4/05	Todd is the man. If you're taking WL, accept no substitute, Beers' the way to go. Word.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		4	5	5	1	295907	10/22/04	this class was something to look forward to every week. he was fun, and genuinly interesting, plus he was just a great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Beers	4.8	2	Literature		3	5	3	5	295907	9/13/04	Best professor I've had at RIT. If you're genuinely interested in what Todd is teaching, you'll have the time of your life in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Beiman	4.0	1	Film		1	3	3	3	964914	3/24/08	Very strict and very tough but will usually give you a decent grade if you put in the work and show up on time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Beiman	4.0	2	Film		1	4	5	3	964914	1/2/08	She is a great teacher if you are willing to work for the grade. Never expect an A, she claims she wouldnt give herself an A. Dont skip....ever. Do every assignment and be on time to class and she wont kill you!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Beiman	4.0	2	Film		2	4	5	4	964914	3/8/08	Excellent teacher, but somewhat difficult personality. VERY strict about attendance and tardiness. Come to every class and don't be even a minute late. Can seem unapproachable, but is extremely polite and very helpful by e-mail. Brought us all candy before Christmas! Very competent with very fair tests. I learned a ton and I recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Bell	3.2	0	Anthropology	106	5	2	2	3	1696937	12/11/12	I actually had this professor at St. John Fisher. It is clear that he is a new professor and is still learning how to teach. He is really nice and unafraid to directly critique anyone. He has a hard time getting his thoughts across in lectures and its hard to understand what he wants in assignments. He is busy and doesn't help much outside class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Bell	3.2	1	Anthropology	101	2	3	2	1	1696937	2/29/12	He's nothing more than average. Tries substituting every word with something more complex than it has to be. Told us to study Wikipedia articles for the final exam. Stretches things farther than he has to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Bell	3.2	2	Anthropology	101	4	5	5	3	1696937	5/9/12	Friendly, funny and approachable. He is interesting and well learned. Easy tests. Not much outside work. Younger perspective on topics. Keeps class interesting with videos. Nothing bad to say about him at all. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	2	1642979	3/13/12	Easy going teacher. Tries to explain all concepts and will help you outside of class whenever needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	1642979	1/30/12	I hate math and this teacher made the material clear and easy to understand. Highly recommend this teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	1642979	11/20/11	Will seriously do anything to help his students. Drops the lowest quiz grade, has multiple times you can come in and review or get help. Also he is very easy going and will not add much stress to your life. Try and get this teacher, he will make a difference
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics	101	5	5	4	1	1642979	2/23/12	I honestly dislike math, but this professor made learning very easy. Concepts were explained clearly, and homework assignments were actually helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	1642979	11/27/11	I didn't even do well in his class but he definitely went out of his way to help you succeed. I would definitely take him again. He basically just graduated but he knows what he's doing. Work load was completely fair and tests had no surprises. Only uses textbook for MyMathLab code, which you can probably buy separately and save $150.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Bell	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	1642979	11/20/11	Newer and younger teacher who will do anything to help his students pass. He has review sessions before every quiz and test to get you prepared. He drops the lowest quiz just in case as well. The only bad part is he doesn't grade or go over homework, but do it because that is how you keep up on everything. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Belz	2.5	1	Engineering		3	4	1	1	869325	7/27/06	This guy loves to hear himself talk, especially about his job at Kodak and all things cameras. He's pretty sarcastic; unless you get on his good side he'll most likely make fun of you a lot. His slides are awful, many times swapping definitions so you never know what the real concept is. He grades fairly though, and is flexible with group work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	0	Computer Science	208	1	1	1	1	204692	1/24/13	I do highly recommend that you stay away from him. He is not helpful at all. I took intro to programming with him and half of the class failed the final exam. Also half of the class failed his last 2 projects due to the hard requirements he gave. Intro to programming is easy class but with this guy was super hard. My advice to you is to stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	2	Computer Science	208	4	4	3	2	204692	10/25/12	He is a nice professor. Helpful when you ask questions. Grades a little slowly, but is fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	2	Computer Science	217	5	3	4	4	204692	12/1/11	While his teaching methods are kind of dull, he reads off of a powerpoint, and doesn't normally do many examples. He is extremely forgiving and understanding of that fact that it is a INTRO class. That students will not be high level programmers, and he'll look through all of your code just to try and give you as many points as you deserve.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	2	Computer Science		3	3	5	NULL	204692	5/5/03	Very clear, very informative, knows his stuff. He'll help you until you get the concept, but at the same time he leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the lesser intelligences in the class, if you get my drift. ;) Overall, recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	0	Computer Science	210	2	1	2	4	204692	1/15/13	If you get this prof. I would suggest that you switch immediately. He does not explain things most of his programs crash. For notes he puts screen shots of programs instead of showing you them. During the labs he sits at his laptop putting in grades and he only has 2 hours of office hours a week. Also he said not to use the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	2	Computer Science	217	4	5	4	2	204692	2/1/12	He was hard to get used to, but he is very helpful,and easy grader. He makes you learn the material. Take him if you get the chance.I had him for 217, and 218
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alec Berenbaum	3.3	1	Computer Science	414	2	3	2	4	204692	11/9/09	Prof. can teach well.. but he does not teach up to his potential and is a bit lazy in giving programming examples. His own examples crashes.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Bernius	3.0	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	958819	2/4/08	quizes are open not so even though you dont need to go to class if you dont you will not have the notes for the quizes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	389	4	5	5	5	973570	11/17/12	Dr. Bezakova is a fantastic professor. She shows enthusiasm for CS Theory and makes it enjoyable for students as well. Explanations were incredibly clear and when students were confused she made sure to clarify for them. One of the best professor's I've had. (Textbook was necessary on occasion.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	389	4	5	5	4	973570	11/16/12	I struggled so much in the beginning. Thankfully, Bezakova is extremely fair in her grading and helpful when you ask questions. I went from a C mid-quarter to an A after the final. Her lectures are very informative, she gives plenty of examples to help you understand the material. She is hands down one of the best CS Professors. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	973570	5/22/11	you will always find a beautiful smile on her face when ever you go for some help. Don't misunderstand me. I am just trying to say that you'll always find her very helpful. unlike other professors, she's fair with all students and her grading is absolutely unbiased and transparent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	389	5	5	5	5	973570	11/19/10	Extremely approachable, fair grader, explains concepts thoroughly. Possibly my favorite professor at RIT. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	973570	1/26/10	Really good teacher. Explains everything a lot (but can sometimes explain things a little too much though). Friendly, willing to answer questions and help out. Easy to learn from.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	4	973570	10/28/09	Good teacher (pretty comical too) for the new problem based intro to cs classes cs majors have to take now. The material in general isn't easy, but she does her best to help you understand it, and is always willing to help you via email or in person if you let her know! Definitely better than some of the other problem based intro teachers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	973570	4/5/07	Good teacher, knows tons about the material. Sometimes her presentation can be a little daunting, but she offers really good help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	973570	11/16/12	Dr. Bezakova is a wonderful teacher who is extremely passionate about CS theory and always overflowing with enthusiasm. Her presentation of material is fantastic: She draws unbelievably helpful diagrams that make even the most difficult concepts very clear, and if anyone is still lost, she's always ready with one or two other unique explanations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	389	5	5	4	4	973570	7/7/11	CS Theory is a class you do NOT want a bad teacher for. It is very hard especially Honors. Material is complex, subtle, abstract. That's why Bezakova is awesome - she explains, gives examples, answers questions, and grades leniently. I struggled all quarter and got an A for my hard work. Most professors give you a C when you struggle. LOVE HER.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	389	4	5	5	4	973570	11/22/10	After taking her previously for the CS sequence, I jumped at the opportunity to take her for CS Theory. Very helpful. Very fair. Funny and entertaining. By far my favorite professor at RIT. The content is hard but she is extremely helpful during office hours. If you are willing to put in the effort, you can't go wrong with her. I highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	801	1	5	4	3	973570	6/7/10	Great teacher, great class. This was a new class this year that she taught because it is her primary research focus. Definitely a hard course that requires a fair amount of work, but you learned a lot. The version she taught was on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Very approachable with questions in and out of class. Overall would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	241	4	5	5	4	973570	1/13/10	The class itself was challenging but fair. She is very helpful if you contact her via office hours or email. Her in class presentations are clear and she is entertaining/cute to watch. For RIT nerds, she's like Negi in Negima! She is adorable but very competent. You can't help but think she's cute like a kid. If you take her, you will understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivona Bezakova	4.6	2	Computer Science	800	1	4	4	4	973570	2/14/08	teaches students like they dont know 1+1=2 but a good prof. she knows her stuff.. helpful too.. but course kinda hard.. but then its the toughest course in the department
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		3	5	4	4	623410	2/19/13	He is a good dude, real funny, and always in a good mood. He was also an excellent teacher :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics	101	2	3	2	3	623410	11/9/11	Difficult to understand at times (sit in the front row). Principles of Microeconomics is graph overload; difficult to understand if this is your first time dealing with these things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		3	4	4	2	623410	9/22/11	Very good teacher, no homework and no mandatory attendance, but do expect to fall behind if you skip class. Moves at a fast one example and on pace, but if you ask questions or want him to clarify what he said he always makes a good effort to help you. Not the easiest teacher to understand sometimes but you get used to it. Great prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics		2	2	3	1	623410	11/20/10	Nice enough guy, but his teaching style is a bit scattered. Don't take this class unless you are interested in economics, if you need to fill an elective credit find some other class to take!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics		4	2	2	3	623410	2/8/10	horrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics	101	1	1	1	3	623410	10/21/09	Awful teacher. Presentations are unclear, posts homework due the next day at at 8pm the night before, references the textbook but doesn't provide the answers to homework problems. Tests on material barely covered in class and not covered on the homework. AVOID!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics	511	3	3	2	3	623410	1/27/09	Very unclear material presentation. No handouts.Need to study on your own. Repeat the same "Basically I mean" but what he means stays unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		3	4	3	1	623410	2/18/08	nice teacher. very helpful. some online quizzes and pretty easy tests. fair grader. show up to class and take notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics		1	2	2	1	623410	2/18/07	He explains stuff pretty well, but is a tough grader - I worked damn hard in his class and still ended up with a C. He gives 5-6 online tests, two exams plus a final and sometimes hwk, I would recommend him if you really really like Econ.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		2	5	5	5	623410	5/22/06	explains really well. u'll like the class if u like the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics	101	4	5	5	4	623410	11/13/12	Great teacher. His accent doesn't take long to get used to at all. Great sense of humor, he made the class enjoyable. If you don't get a concept it's your own fault because he gives plenty of opportunity to ask for clarification.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		3	4	4	4	623410	10/25/11	Real nice guy will help and clarify when you need it. Accent is not an issue. No Homework, No 'MyEconLab', never uses textbook. Tests/quizes are from lecture notes and drops the lowest 2 quizes...highly reccomend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics	325	2	3	3	1	623410	12/4/10	He is an okay teacher. The way he teaches is very brief and quick, so don't expect to stay on the same topic for too long. If you are a no textbook, example only kind of person then he is the guy for you. But he teaches a little too fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics	101	4	3	3	4	623410	5/18/10	This professor is average, definitely not the worst. His tests are very straightforward, and based solely on his lecture. The lectures were straight from the book material. Attend class and take good notes and you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		5	4	3	3	623410	12/1/09	Good professor, not difficult unless you expect everything to be spoon-fed to you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics		3	2	2	2	623410	10/16/09	Easy teacher and not hard to work with, but hard to understand in class and teaches in a pretty boring method. Claimed he was going to teach in terms of real-life application, but spent the entire class talking about theory and supply/demand graphs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics		2	2	1	3	623410	1/25/09	Terrible Teacher. Very strong accent which makes him hard to understand. Very sloppy hand. Final was supposed to be on the whole quarter but he made it on the last week of class only which he did not post any online notes for. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		5	4	4	4	623410	1/27/08	I like him. Somepeople hated his class but it was easy. Makes it easy to get a B but just put some effort and you can get an A. Somepeople dont like his accent but just payattention and its easy to understand. I would take class with him again no problem
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics		1	5	1	3	623410	5/27/06	horrible teaching....hard grader..avoid
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	2	Economics		5	4	3	3	623410	11/29/05	He cannot teach. but he is a esay grader, even if you dont study you will get atleast B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	1	Economics		4	3	2	1	623410	11/26/05	bad teacher but easy grader. just go to class and u can get at least a B
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bahrat Bhole	3.0	0	Economics		1	1	1	3	623410	5/20/05	Very difficult. Very difficult to understand. Take anyone else. Stay away!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Biehler	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	1182986	4/7/09	She gives out tests that gave only 3 or 4 questions... on one of the tests i got a 66% because i got one question wrong. I don't like her and I withdrew. Waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Biehler	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	1182986	10/10/08	Teresa is a good lady, but can get very confusing. Has a hard time interacting with NTID (Im not NTID) but its distracting. 12 quizzes and they deviate from what youve learned. 3 tests which are pretty fair. Have fun, study and youll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology	380	3	4	5	5	864946	2/27/12	I've had him twice now, enjoyed it both times. Would definitely take him again if he's teaching a class that I need. He can be very dry, but as long as you get the work done he doesn't care if you goof off a little in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	864946	3/30/11	Really helpful guy. Intimidating at first, but once you get to know him he is an awesome guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	4	864946	5/10/10	Tough but fair is a good way to describe him. You won't be passing his class unless you actually, you know, learn the material, but he's more than willing to give you whatever help you need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	1	Information Technology		1	3	3	3	864946	10/20/08	He's a good teacher. The subject can just be really difficult at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology		2	4	4	3	864946	10/17/07	Bierre is ok. he is easy to understand and goes through material well but tests are EXTREMELY hard on the practical part. If you have Bierre Labs become critical because of near impossible test practicals...at least in Programming I.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	1	Information Technology		2	3	3	5	864946	12/5/06	Bierre isn't a bad teacher overall, just his lectures are incredibly boring due to the "cookie-cutter" power-point-and-read that most of the programming teachers seem to use. And he lost one of my practical exams. He did let me retake it, though. I wouldn't recommend Bierre, try for another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	0	Information Technology		3	1	1	5	864946	7/11/06	This teacher has a very hot temper and generally refuses to help the students. My entire class was quite estatic when he began to yell at people about stopping there typing at that exact moment when there were still simple errors to fix. Avoid this teacher and take Mr. Whittington if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology	221	5	5	5	5	864946	10/28/11	He is an awesome professor. I took the class in another college and retook it here so that might be why it was too easy. But it seemed like if I didn't know anything, it would be taught very well. Lectures give you the basics and in-class activities work on what was learned. HW was fairly easy and tests were very easy. Didn't use the book thou
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology	101	5	5	5	5	864946	3/30/11	Awesome Professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	5	864946	2/18/09	Had him for Distributed App Programming - all we had to do was do a quarter-long java project. No quizzes / tests / homework. Only in-class exercises which were really easy. Good class to take, but he can get kind of boring. Still a pretty good guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	1	Information Technology	217	2	2	3	4	864946	11/8/07	He is just the basic lecture teacher. Does not really get into detail that much with you to get you involved. I basically had to get help from students who already knew Java all quarter. And thats how most kids who didnt already know Java felt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	4	864946	9/13/07	He's tough, but fair and will help when you're stuck. But he expects you to work for your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bierre	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	4	4	4	864946	11/3/06	Whatever that obvious freshman wrote about him is not true. He never lost his temper, and in fact in my whole java class I never heard him raise his voice. He was a very fair grader, I think everyone got 100 on their final project for just trying. Once mycourse screwed up and did not submit our lab properly and he still let us hand it in
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Beier	3.8	2	Physics	312	3	4	4	1	1693614	5/21/12	homework requires reading in the book, quizzes are announced and easy if you understand that week's material. tests are ok, but toughly graded
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Beier	3.8	2	Physics	311	3	4	4	3	1693614	2/13/12	took a chance and took her for my UP1 class and am loving it she helps you with all your problems and is willing to help you out however she can. we need more like her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Beier	3.8	0	Physics	201	3	2	2	4	1693614	10/24/11	A lot of lab work, very "nit-picky" with her grading. Otherwise not terrible just not great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Beier	3.8	2	Physics		2	4	5	3	1693614	5/14/12	Dr. Beier is very nice and seems to work well for the majority of students. Her teaching method is basically to go through theory and give you formulas, then ask you to do problems. This didn't work that well for me because I learn better by seeing examples done out first. Still, overall she is very helpful and cares about her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Beier	3.8	2	Physics		4	5	4	4	1693614	2/12/12	Great Professor. Overall really helpful. Her quizzes are fairly easy if you study for them, and her exams are similar to problems done in class or on mastering physics. Only assigns one mastering physics homework a week. Always in her office and very helpful. Highly recommend you take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Beiter	5.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	1340117	1/24/11	PLEASE TAKE ANY WITH HER!!! She's very helpful with any courses you ask for. She's flexible but has good expectation for you all. TAKE IT WITH HER I MEAN IT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Beiter	5.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	1340117	10/21/09	Karen Beiter is the****.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Bell	4.2	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	3	1643063	1/24/13	Had her for Discovery. She's really nice but the class is kind of boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Bell	4.2	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	2	1643063	11/12/11	Nice teacher. Boring, though. The class was easy. if you attend the class, you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Bell	4.2	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	5	2	1643063	12/27/12	Denise is a fun, nice teacher to be around. She may have a bit of an attitude at times if you call out often (like me), but nothing that stings. She's always positive and looking up and willing to help if you ask.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	3	3	4	52260	1/22/13	She knows what she teaches and she know how to teach it. I took 3D design with her and she changed my view of the world. She's not easy but if you work hard, you can still get good grades. I really learned a lot from her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	3	52260	4/12/11	Such a sweet professor, she really cares about her students. Her projects are very helpful for design students and doesn't involve a heavy work load either
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	3	3	1	52260	2/9/10	She is a hard teacher it's hard to know what she expects from you. She's a weird lady, acts strangely. I would've switched out of this class if i wanted to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	3	3	3	52260	3/2/09	This teacher is hard becuase she needs to be, you learn a lot by having to come up with solutions on your own. This is college! You need to learn that you cant be led by the hand anymore, and she teaches just that. The class is enjoyable, just understand she grades based on how well you execute the process of design.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	52260	4/12/06	VERY VERY GOOD TEACHER. She's the best 3D teacher! Her class is hard, but you learn a lot, and YOU LEARN TO LOVE HER! Eventually...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	3	3	4	52260	2/3/06	I agree with a lot of the comments others have said. I started off rough with her, and it was difficult, because we would be at odds with each other. At the end of the year, the reason why she gave me such a hard time, because she knew I had potential, and wasn't going to let me take the easy way out. She's good, but you have to figure her out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	4	2	1	52260	5/3/05	She's really vague with what she wants and you'll start out hating her but she grows on you. She really cares about your so she pushes really hard which can seem like way to much at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	3	1	3	52260	10/29/04	VERY vague! She will never tell you exactly what she wants, and if you don't come up with the solution on your own, she makes sure you know she's dissapointed in you. A very frustrating teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	4	3	NULL	52260	5/14/02	she can be tough, but she cares. taught me about myself and school...many thxs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	3	2	52260	7/29/11	I admire this lady with all my heart. She is so smart and if you really care about design principles than she will change the way you look at the world. If you do not appreciate her and the class after the whole year than you aren't going to make it in design. The people who don't like her don't get that being vague help you think on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	2	52260	3/4/10	Did not learn anything from this class. Waste of time and money. I would've chosen a different teacher if I had a chance to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	3	52260	12/1/09	Seriously one of the best professors i have had, if no the best! She expects alot from her students, but you learn so much in the process, especially if you are going into the design fields. She works you hard, but by the end of the year, it is worth it. I learned more in Roberley's class than any other class i have taken!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		1	2	1	1	52260	2/26/07	I was always confused about the projects she handed out and never know what she expected. She is hard to get along with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	3	52260	2/8/06	Not my favorite teacher. You have to get used to her. It's hard dealing with her most of the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	2	52260	5/3/05	Hard class in the sence its hard to grasp what she wants or expects from you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	3	52260	3/16/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberley Bell	2.9	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	NULL	52260	3/15/04	I started out REALLY hating her and 3D Design. But over time, she really won me over with her wacky personality and her unconventional sense of humor. Although it may not seem like it at first, she really is willing to help her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	1252473	3/4/13	Very easy Liberal Arts credit, enjoyable to learn. Paper every week but they are very easy to too. Tests are easy, just review notes and read the text and you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	5	3	1252473	5/7/11	Wonderful teacher! Slight Italian accent, a pleasure to listen to. Really made me think about issues I had never thought about. Very helpful explanations of at times difficult texts. Requires regular reading and note-taking. Fair exams. She truly has a passion for her subject matter, and is very enthusiastic. Open-minded, listens to every opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	2	1	2	1	1252473	5/13/10	Poorly organized, always late, writes the letter 'a' like its an 'e'. Terribly boring, and sparks painful discussions, but dismisses any opinion that conflicts with her own. Occasional misinformation. Poor grading scheme: Everything is worth the percentage points its worth in your final grade, but she almost exclusively deducts whole points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	2	5	5	3	1252473	2/2/10	Passionate professor who loves Philosophy. Lectures are very interesting, although the books we were asked to buy were not really needed since she pointed out quotes and went over everything in the readings each class. I rated her class as hard because the only work we turned in was two responses, a midterm, and a final, so an A is hard to get!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	5	3	4	2	1252473	5/21/12	do the work, look over notes before tests, and participate in class and you'll have an easy A. vocabulary is a crucial part of the tests, so pay attention when she stresses certain words
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	0	Philosophy	210	2	2	2	3	1252473	2/3/11	As stated before, she dismisses opinions that differ from her own. Hard to understand at times. She teachers Philosophy as if it were a history class. Hard to get an A because of how few graded assignments there are. She is always late to class. Most classes are boring, circular discussions that are never clarified.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy	210	3	4	4	4	1252473	3/1/10	Shes got a slight Italian accent but youll barely even notice it after a week. Class is fairly easy, just listen and take good notes and read the readings you'll do fine. Grades based on 2 response papers attendance and 2 take home tests. No final. Take home tests are fairy challenging, response papers are easy As as long as you explain yourself
Rochester Institute of Technology	Silvia Benso	3.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	5	1252473	1/20/10	The class was a special topic:Phenomenology. Benso is an intelligent professor and speaks the material well, but phenomenology is just hard stuff to grasp. That is the only reason my easiness rating is medium.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Berent	5.0	2	Graphic Arts	402	3	5	5	4	1536103	6/2/11	New-ish teacher but she was great! I had her for Imagery in Design & she was helpful & pushed her students to do better. She cared about her students and them improving! I learned a lot from her class. Also, nice sweet personality!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Berent	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	4	1536103	1/28/11	One of the best professors I've ever had. Extremely helpful and full of knowledge. Would recommend her classes to anyone of any skill level
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Berns	3.5	0	Not Specified		1	1	2	1	603650	11/19/10	This class is impossible. Avoid at all costs. Roy is completely incapable of teaching undergraduates. I hope that he never has to teach undergrads again. Homeworks were long and drawn out and absolutely pointless. A complete waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Berns	3.5	2	Not Specified		4	5	5	3	603650	12/7/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Berns	3.5	2	Not Specified	775	3	4	4	5	603650	6/12/07	Took course online. Demystified several topics which had heretofore been to me black arts; now they're familiar. Helpful and available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mishkat Bhattacharya	4.8	2	Physics	311	5	4	5	2	1744881	11/17/12	Paid little attention in class, was a very chill guy. What I did pay attention to was very clear and straightforward. Quizzes & exams straightforward. Expected/planning for a B in the class and ended up with an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mishkat Bhattacharya	4.8	2	Physics	310	5	5	5	5	1744881	11/16/12	Amazing teacher makes everything easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bharat Bhole	4.5	2	Economics	211	4	5	4	5	1701747	3/21/12	Excellent professor. Hard working. One of the best to take Microeconomics with. Don't know of a better 1. Never read or bought the book. You don't need it. Got an A. Very comprehensive notes. They are most important. If you FULLY understand them, quizzes and tests will be a breeze. He is a young Indian professor with doctorate degree. Great Guy!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	2	Music		3	4	4	4	1344973	3/4/13	Prof. Biles is a great lecturer, and an even better professor. He is really down-to-earth, and obviously cares about his students. Very approachable and helpful outside of class as well. Would definitely recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	2	Music	295	3	5	4	1	1344973	10/24/12	the class is hard not the professor. lot of work but biles is one of the better lecturers. if you can get lawley take her instead
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	1	Music	295	5	2	3	1	1344973	10/28/11	Lectures were quick and didn't pay attention, the labs are based off of the lectures but you can get by without knowing the lectures. HW is a 8 pg paper and a 5 min ppt on it, but its easy since you can pick ANY topic. The "final" is a 5 min ppt on what you learned in the class. Just take notes in the lecture and you're pretty much good.nice guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	1	Music		3	2	4	1	1344973	12/4/09	Yes, he does have a monotone and there is very minimal class activity. He provides notes online so you don't have to take any and he provides a study guide that covers pretty much the whole exam. Overall, very boring but if you at least try and attend class you should have no problem, I'm no schooly but I got through.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	2	Music	295	5	5	4	3	1344973	12/23/12	Biles gives interesting lectures, but the projects were completely useless. Really easy class one research paper, a power point presentation (that you do the voice-over), and a 20-things I learned in this class project, portrayed however you wish. Biles never graded any of my assignments, and just gave out A's. Also there is no textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	2	Music	103	5	5	4	5	1344973	4/30/12	Very good at teaching the material. If you need help, he will go over any material you need. The workload is fairly easy, as he wants you to focus on the quarter long project. Like any class, you will get out of it what you put in.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Biles	3.5	0	Music	295	5	1	2	4	1344973	2/2/10	Introduction to Interactive Media was a horrible, useless experience for me, but I sat through the first session of it ever and it was a group class between several professors, not just Biles. In labs he experimented, giving either too little information or too much technical stuff without really translating it in English perse. Easy class though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barb Birkett	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		1	5	3	1	412997	2/20/06	She is an extremely helpful and very nice teacher but the material she teaches is incrediablly boring. The average test score of the class's first exam was 67.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barb Birkett	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	3	412997	12/14/04	Great lady- will do anything to help a student in need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barb Birkett	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	5	412997	9/29/05	Barb Birkett is one of the sweetest professors I have ever had, she even allowed students to call her Mrs. Birkett. I enjoyed having her as a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barb Birkett	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		2	4	4	3	412997	11/11/04	A real expert in what she teaches. Sweet and understanding to boot. Old fashioned in many regards, but most of all, very willing and eager to help when you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besnik Bislimi	4.9	2	Economics	202	1	5	5	5	1058342	2/22/13	One of the best proffessors Kosova currently has. He is an expert in his field. It was my honor to learn from his teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besnik Bislimi	4.9	2	Economics	402	2	5	5	2	1058342	2/1/09	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besnik Bislimi	4.9	2	Economics	101	3	5	5	4	1058342	5/19/11	He is a walking economic encyclopedia.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besnik Bislimi	4.9	2	Economics		2	5	4	2	1058342	11/17/08	He is a pretty good proffessor. His lectures are not the most interesting (I don't know how economics can be interesting) but he's pretty good at it. His tests however, are pretty hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	5	4	4	404890	11/2/12	Good professor, but grades late and lumps quizzes at the end. Discussion based.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society	451	5	5	5	4	404890	12/4/11	My only regret is that I only got to take one class with her as she is the absolute best professor I have had at this university.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		3	5	5	3	404890	9/19/10	by far the best professor at rit. great person and really cares about her students. take all her classes, u wont regret it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society	451	3	5	4	2	404890	7/7/08	Cyborg Theory, is the class I had with her, She is a really good teacher, she know about the topic and she really had an interesting point of view about things, and made us think about different things. You won't get bored in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		5	5	5	5	404890	11/8/06	Very good teacher, makes the class very intersting. I love coming to her class every week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	5	4	3	404890	10/7/05	Grea Teacher, Makes class fun. Very discussion based.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		5	4	4	NULL	404890	5/8/04	Course was quite easy, got an A and for an 8am class that is pretty good. You should atleast do half the readings. There are two papers and she is a fair grader. Take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		3	5	5	2	404890	10/31/12	Amazing Professor, Interesting and wants you to do well. Class is heavily discussion based
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		5	5	5	5	404890	5/10/11	Class is fun to come to, which is important because attendance isn't mandatory beyond coming to the one class you present in & the classes she hands out the midterm & final for. Discussions aren't railroaded based on professor's whims/opinions, which leads to a lot of energy in the classroom. Great teacher, would recommend highly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society	445	4	5	5	5	404890	3/6/10	Great teacher, scheduled in H1N1 days. Total of 3 papers for final grade in addition to 2 presentations. Class discussions were interesting on a controversial topic. One of the best profs at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		5	5	4	3	404890	11/28/07	Great teacher. Made the class fun and interesting. Not that much work but you learn because she makes it interesting. Recommend to anyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Blizzard	4.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	5	5	5	404890	1/25/06	Had her for cyborg theory, gender studies, and biomedical issues. Highly recommend! makes classes interesting, and if you don't want to do the readings, you really don't have to, but they're not bad, and actually rather interesting. classes consist of lots of discussion, homework entails a few papers and a presentation -- very doable.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexis Blondrage	4.0	2	Biology		4	4	4	3	934573	12/13/06	Last quarter was her first time teaching the lab. I have to admit that she did a great job teaching. She explains the materials clear and the best thing about her is that she permits students to leave the lab once they get the job done, usually an hour early. Quizzes will be given on a weekly basis, so READ the lab manuals! She's also hot, too. =P
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	0	Film		1	1	1	4	767242	12/6/11	THE ABSOLUTE WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE COLLEGE CAREER. He not only has no clue what he is talking about, but somehow expects everyone to know what they are doing in the class even though he doesn't teach you anything! He's also hypercritical and generally unpleasant. Please take him back RIT, no one here at U of R wants him!! Worst!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	0	Film		3	2	1	4	767242	3/31/10	Vague in what he wants in his assignments. Nitpicks at the smallest insignificant details. Often felt I had to cater my projects toward his quirky sense of humor to get a good grade on it. Will purposefully leave out his criticism on a project until you hand in the final version then takes off points for things he could have mentioned earlier.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	0	Film	991	4	1	1	1	767242	6/12/07	the guy's from germany, yeah?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	2	Film		3	4	5	5	767242	5/23/11	Very good teacher. Lectures are interesting, and he definitely knows his stuff. READ the assignments he gives you, because he will call on you. Is that college is for? Great teacher. Don't listen to the other reviews.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	0	Film		5	2	2	4	767242	2/6/08	Johannes is a really nice guy he just has no idea what he wants. One minute he tells you that he likes something the next he tears your project apart. He doesn't know how to run all the equipment that well either. His style is to let you figure everything out without giving much help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Johannes Bockwoldt	2.4	2	Film		3	5	4	4	767242	11/29/05	Definitely knows his stuff. Sometimes gets lost or confused on story ideas, but his unknowing humor makes up for it. Better one on one and once you get to know him. Calls on people randomly in class, so watch when you fall asleep. Sometimes I find myself making up something to say
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Boedo	4.0	1	Engineering		4	2	4	5	1650319	2/27/12	Very good professor and very available up until week 8. After that he drops off the radar while his class struggles to complete one of the biggest projects most of the students have been assigned at RIT up until that point. He's a great teacher if you handle the final project well, otherwise it is frustrating torture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Boedo	4.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1650319	11/21/11	Very knowledgeable and helpful. Great class for future Design Engineers. Design project was long but not too bad. Has case studies every Friday that you're graded on. They're a bit intimidating but not too bad. HW takes a long time but tests are a lot easier even in only an hour. Shows a movie near the end of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	536	2	5	5	4	670614	2/28/12	Let's be honest, Professor Bogaard is one of the best, most enthusiastic professors at RIT. He knows his stuff solid. Lectures are entertaining and full of knowledge. The grade is only based on 3 projects (javascript, svg, jquery) and a practical, which is what makes the course tough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	536	2	5	5	5	670614	2/4/11	The best web development teacher. Almost has tons of energy which keeps you alert in class. Tries to make some good jokes which is always entertaining. Grades difficult, but that is what you need if you want to excel!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	3	670614	3/12/10	Dan is by far the best IT teacher I've ever had at RIT, and this is coming from a soon to be graduate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	536	1	5	5	5	670614	7/6/09	Awesome! Knows a TON and conveys the information easily. You'll be a guru if you can keep up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	409	3	5	5	5	670614	11/6/08	One of my all-time favorite profs. He communicates very naturally with everyone, he is excited about what he teaches, he stays on task about 99% of the time, and makes the topic of web design fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology		2	4	4	4	670614	11/20/07	One of the coolest IT professors - definitely knows his stuff too. probably not the best teacher if you're new to the subject matter he's teaching about but he'll definitely teach you cool stuff if you already know a little about the subject
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	3	670614	8/31/05	Coolest IT teacher there is
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	536	3	5	5	5	670614	3/10/11	Dan is the man. He is very into what he teaches and it's all cool stuff. It's not easy material for most but he gives you plenty of time to work on the projects as well as help, if you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	4	670614	4/21/10	Dan is an amazing teacher who has a passion for teaching. He cares that you learn. He's easily my favorite teacher at RIT. If you haven't taken a class with him, you should, just make sure to start your projects early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	409	5	5	5	5	670614	1/20/10	Dan has a minivan. Tell him that. He'll get it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	409	5	4	4	5	670614	11/7/08	A fun teacher. Really upbeat and excited about teaching. I'm not sure I'd recommend him to people who don't have a prior background in some web dev before you take him otherwise you might be confused because he leaves a lot to personal learning. Willing to help or chat about anything though. Would take him again in more advanced classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	546	3	5	5	5	670614	4/21/08	Dan is an awesome teacher. He's smart and very helpful. He's a cool dude!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Bogaard	4.8	2	Information Technology	536	4	5	5	5	670614	11/13/06	Really good. Knows his stuff and is willing to help you out. I recommend highly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Leisa Boling	4.5	2	Languages	202	1	5	4	5	1509148	12/11/10	Professor Boling helped me improve my ASL grammar more than I ever thought possible. That being said, she was a very challenging teacher that really pushed you to succeed. I think that if you are up to the challenge and willing to put in the time and effort, you can really improve from this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Boone Jr.	3.0	0	Literature		3	2	2	3	266945	12/29/06	did not like his style. dont waste your time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Boone Jr.	3.0	2	Literature		3	4	4	2	266945	11/13/05	He's a pretty good guy. A lot of your enjoyment of the class comes from whether you like writing or not. He's a fairly easy grader but that may depend on how well you write.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Boone Jr.	3.0	2	Literature		3	3	4	4	266945	9/3/05	The man is insane. He is great. He would tell people to go back to high school and smack their teachers because they didn't teach them anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Boone Jr.	3.0	1	Literature		4	3	3	NULL	266945	8/23/04	Is also a highschool teacher. Interesting man, discussions in class were generally interesting. I personally didn't write way he likes, so I didn't do very well, but others did. I was out of town for the midterm, let me do something else we talked before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Boone Jr.	3.0	2	Literature		4	3	5	NULL	266945	10/23/03	Cool professor, can be funny at times, interesting discussions and always asks for your opinions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bigelow	3.4	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	4	1138568	10/11/11	While he does get off topic fairly often, he has very interesting lectures, and is always willing to clarify and help you if you don't understand something. Bear with his lectures, and classes with him are definetly worth it. RECOMMENDED especially if you love typography, because he definetly knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bigelow	3.4	0	Graphic Arts	217	1	1	2	4	1138568	4/22/09	A very challenging, unforgiving teacher. While he's very knowledgeable, he's also one that gives out so much homework like we don't have any other class but his. Of course, that's how everyone at RIT is anyway...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bigelow	3.4	1	Graphic Arts		1	2	3	2	1138568	2/25/09	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bigelow	3.4	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	3	5	1138568	2/1/10	Most knowledgeable teacher I ever had. His lectures are exciting and interesting. Gives a decent amount of work, but it's bearable. By far the worst is poorly worded tests that are misleading. But you can ask him anything and will take time to work with you if you don't understand something. Repeatedly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Bigelow	3.4	2	Graphic Arts	217	3	5	4	4	1138568	3/1/09	Chuck places a lot of emphasis on showing up, paying attention, using your brain and asking questions. In other words, if you just want to read a book and answer multiple choice questions, take another class. His classes can open your mind if you want them to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Bills	3.8	2	Information Technology	360	3	5	5	3	745496	11/7/08	Had her for Database. She's a nice, happy lady and always willing to help. Daily practice exercises are given as well as weekly homework. Exams are fair and are usually rehash of some of the homework/PEs. She's very helpful if you ask questions, but busy so scheduling appointments is difficult. Would recommend again in the future!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Bills	3.8	0	Information Technology	217	2	2	2	2	745496	10/25/06	Did not know a thing about Java before taking this class, and she didn't make it easy to understand for first time programmers. Wish I knew something about it before I got to RIT.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dianne Bills	3.8	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	1	745496	11/3/05	I knew zero Java going into the course, and was struggling throughout. Professor Bills really helped me to get back on track. Extremely nice, and easy to approach. Class is taught with lecture slides(available before class), followed by inclass activitys. Homework is given once a week, and is due the next class. Overall: Great Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	1184857	11/29/12	The real professional. Great person, great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science	707	3	5	5	4	1184857	12/1/11	Excellent professor. There is nothing wrong with his English. I'm glad I took his java class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	1184857	5/4/10	Great and sincere prof. knows what he teaches very well. 90% of questions i got in my programming interviews were from his class. Teaches key points. Very helpful outside the class. fair in grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science	719	2	4	4	4	1184857	9/23/09	Succinct, but to the point, in his teaching, Dr. Bischof is demanding in homeworks and exams, but fair. Most important aspect of this teacher is his publication of lecture notes in his website. Many years later I still benefited from visiting the website for some Java related information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science	707	4	5	4	4	1184857	11/15/08	Great guy, very helpful outside of class, got me through a really rough patch learning the material!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	5	1184857	4/29/12	He is an awesome prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	0	Computer Science	707	2	1	1	4	1184857	7/1/11	He does not know English very well.. it's hard to understand him at times. Only stick to what he teaches else you will not get a good grade. Not a very good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	2	Computer Science	707	5	4	4	5	1184857	12/15/09	Awesome professor. Gives you a broad idea of Java in the bridge course. Grades very fairly, he looks at the big picture/key point instead of the small bits of programming. He also introduces you a lot about CS and guides you to the right path if you talk to him often. I absolutely would like to take his class again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans-Peter Bischof	3.8	0	Computer Science		3	2	2	3	1184857	11/17/08	This Prof. teaches Java, but i think he even does not know J of java, so i request you dont waste your time and money by taking courses under him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	731	1	5	5	3	956564	4/6/13	Outstanding course. Dr. Bitterman is a true asset to the program and department (which he helped to start out.) He likes to examine issues from every angle, so you will come out of the class thinking differently then when you went in!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	956564	4/23/11	Best Professor in an otherwise lousy program. Comments are right, he doesn't like BS, but he knows his stuff. Take him if you want a job after you graduate, but not if you just want an easy course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		5	5	5	5	956564	3/26/10	Bitterman comes across as a tough teacher, but he's really a nice guy. Works you hard, but definitely way better than most profesors at R.I.T.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		3	3	4	3	956564	3/4/10	Strict Professor but nothing dramatic. Interesting class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		5	5	5	5	956564	2/19/10	This class was awesome, and Prof. Bitterman made it excellent. He was prepared and had great guests come in to speak. He is strickt but it's definitely for your own good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	956564	12/22/09	Bitterman is the bomb. RIT is lucky to have him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		2	5	4	5	956564	8/24/09	Bitterman was one of the most inspiring teachers at RIT, made you really think about why you were there and what you can accomplish as a designer. As for being rude to NTID students, that statement couldn't be more off. As a NTID student for 6 years, Alex was very interested in my life and hearing and was very supportive of my success as a designer
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	956564	5/26/09	No joke this was the toughest class I took at RIT, but I learned so much in it, that it was worth it. Alex is tough, but fair, he doesn't take any BS, and makes you work hard. The Graphic Design department needs more professors like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	4	5	5	956564	5/12/09	Wow. What a hard class! I learned SO much from this guy. A lot of people in my class thought he was too tough, but teachers like Alex are what we need more of at RIT, because so many of the faculty here are useless!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	517	1	5	5	5	956564	11/25/08	hardest most demanding course i've taken at rit. this guy knows his stuff but will make you work for your grade. super nice, but really strict about deadlines, so get your work done on time!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	751	3	5	5	5	956564	10/31/12	Alex is a really nice guy that cares a lot about his students. He helped to start the Architecture Department at RIT and his dedication to it really shows. He's sharp, talented, knowledgable, and willing to help. He has a low tolerance for narrow-mindedness and idiocy, so consider yourself warned!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	956564	11/27/10	Bitterman is the best this program has, and that is saying a lot. Most of the professors suck in this program they started teaching in 1960 and haven't learned a new thing since. Bitterman knows what it's like in the real world, he works you hard, so don't take his class if you're lazy or stupid, because he won't deal with any BS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		5	5	5	4	956564	3/9/10	I was in Dr. Bitterman's experimental Seminar class on the issues in modern design. The class was great, and extremely thought-provoking, but at the heart of it all was Bitterman's quality. He is not only extremely book-smart but also excellent at putting what he knows to use and inspiring thought in his students. Take him for any class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	3	956564	2/19/10	Best professor ever. Worked us really hard, but by far the best course I took at RIT. He knows his stuff, and lazy people don't like him... so if you're lazy stay away, but if you want a job, he's youre guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	0	Design		2	1	3	5	956564	1/30/10	Bitterman is the most disrespectful, self-centered, unfriendly teacher i have ever had. not only does he seem to purposefully make your life difficult for no reason, I have heard more complains from him than anyone else. if you can avoid his class in any way, DO IT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	5	5	5	956564	10/25/09	Dr. Bitterman is an excellent teacher. I have him right now for Corporate and I can tell this will be the best class I've taken since I came to RIT. He pushes hard to help you make your work the best it can be. He is scary on the first day, but after that, he's really cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design		1	3	5	1	956564	6/21/09	OK. This was the hardest course I ever took, and I hated Bitterman buy the time I graduated. I've been working for 2 months now, and I can tell you, this guy knows his shizzle. He makes you work and figure things out, just like the real world. Give him a chance, and you might actually learn something in that crappy program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	460	1	5	5	5	956564	5/13/09	Alex Bitterman is an amazing professor. His course is demanding but very rewarding as it builds professional skills that can be used in almost any career field. While the course is difficult, I learned so much. I would highly recommend his courses to other students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	0	Design		4	1	2	2	956564	2/11/09	He was really rude to the NTID students and in general was not approachable and the class was very boring. But the assignments were very easy and he didn't take attendance
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	753	5	5	5	5	956564	5/20/08	Bitterman rocks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	553	4	5	5	5	956564	5/20/08	This is the best course I've taken at RIT, and it is new and designed by Alex. The whole quarter we did design without a computer, which was challenging, but fun . I learned a lot and Alex was really helpful and patient. Hopefully he'll offer this course again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	222	2	5	5	5	956564	4/7/08	Bitterman is awesome, waaaaaaayyyy better than creative sources.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	222	4	5	4	1	956564	2/21/08	Super nice guy. Kind of seems like a tough teacher, but actually is really nice. Very interesting too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	1	Design	407	2	1	5	2	956564	11/6/07	Bitterman is really great. He likes to talk, but always has something interesting to say. Compared to other professors in the department, he's very cool, and he's kinda flexible with deadlines. He's focused on helping you to develop a good portfolio, and the projects are not just busy work.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	406	2	5	5	5	956564	5/20/08	This was a great class, and Bitterman is awesome. He really makes you think, which is good because it will help you after your out of this place. Definitely take his class if you can fit it in to your schedule, you'll be glad you did. Just be sure to have work every class, because he likes to see that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	222	2	5	5	5	956564	3/20/08	Excellent class and excellent teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	452	1	5	5	5	956564	11/18/07	I had Alex for corporate design. He worked us like dogs but it was REALLY worth it. He makes you work to figure out what you need to do to make your project look good for your portfolio. He's the kind of prof. that I'll probably look back and think: wow, that guy ruled. Take his class, he's WAY better than the other teachers in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alex Bitterman	4.5	2	Design	415	2	5	5	1	956564	5/27/07	Very cool, and definitely knows the latest info. Very portfolio-oriented, which helps to get a decent job.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Bloch	4.2	2	History		4	4	5	4	409573	10/25/04	She's quite adorable. She doesn't like lecturing so class can drag a little but the work is pretty easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Bloch	4.2	2	History		2	5	5	NULL	409573	5/15/04	A fantastic teacher who truely enjoys teaching. Wonderfully understanding and resourceful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Bloch	4.2	2	History		4	5	4	4	409573	4/4/05	Very nice professor and worth getting to know. covers a lot of material in the course, and you must be prepared for her exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Bloch	4.2	2	History		2	4	3	4	409573	10/29/04	Her tests are not what I expected them to be. Make sure you know you material well, and don't assume she'll use the more well known works!! She's very helpful, but you have to go to her, if you need the assistance. Also, she has a way of talking that makes her lectures a bit boring at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Bloch	4.2	1	History		5	3	3	1	409573	10/6/04	every single day i fall asleep and its an hour course from 1-2
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	0	Fine Arts	231	4	1	1	2	750170	8/8/10	She tends to make very broad assignments but then says you did it wrong when you hand it in. Doesn't care much about anyones opinion but her own. Either gives you a good grade all year or a terrible one. Would recommend not taking her for 2D, but it is relatively easy/quick work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	1	Fine Arts		3	4	2	3	750170	2/3/10	Sue is a very positive person. At times she can catch you off guard and say she doesn't like something she liked five minutes ago. She gives a lot of personal feedback if needed. I feel lucky I had her. She has some pretty interesting assignments. Attend classes and try to make up missed classes. Try to have her as a teacher and RESPECT her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		5	4	3	4	750170	11/3/08	Sue is like the crazy artist grandmother I never had. Once you get past her eccentricities, you see that she knows her stuff and knows about design. Good for a foundations-level course, I learned a great deal and now view my work in a different way (as a photographer).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	2	750170	11/16/07	Cutest woman ever. Can be unclear about expectations for projects. Known to change her mind. Go with the flow. Ask questions if you're unsure. Need to work hard in order to do well. She will let you re-submit work. Not hard though. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	2	750170	4/1/07	She is always willing to make suggestions on how to improve your work. Sometimes they can be a little unclear and you have to verify, but it's bearable. She also makes you fill out these weird summary things after each project. If you attend every/most of the class and you're floating between an A and a B or something, she will bump up your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	750170	5/19/10	Sue is an excellent teacher and so nice! I often think of her as a grandma. She really knows what she's talking about. You might get a little frustrated at her round-about ways of doing things, but just let her do things her way. She's very straight forward about what she likes and doesn't like. If you listen to her you're guaranteed a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	750170	1/31/10	Sue is a super nice lady! She is laid back and very fair. Her work is awesome too! She helps each student individually which gives the class a nice atmosphere.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	0	Fine Arts	106	3	1	1	2	750170	8/8/08	always seems nervous and on edge. she yelled at a kid in our class claiming that he used charcoal that was too dark if that is even possible. every time you brought a project in she just basically said you sucked (once she went on and on to a kid saying he didnt try and that it it was worthless). laughed at my friend's art while drawing. ****
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	4	750170	4/25/07	She is very friendly and probably one of the best 2D professors. However, she is sometimes very forgetful and is not clear on certain aspects of the projects. Overall, I would recommend her for class, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Blumendale	3.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	3	750170	11/7/05	She is one of the most friendly and warm hearted teacher art students can have. She is very constructive and bit easy on students. She teach what students should know and get exactly what she want: professional quality artworks by many of students in her class. She is very helpful and encouraging to students who need assistance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	2	Engineering		4	2	5	5	552578	11/21/11	His name is Stephen Boedo
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	2	Engineering	437	2	5	5	5	552578	2/23/10	Great professor, but not the easiest grader. A ton of people complain about his jokes being lame, he's a nerd, etc. Once you get over it and realize if you're taking his class then you're a nerd too, you'll really enjoy his class. EXTREMELY knowledgeable. Definately my fav engineering prof
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	2	Engineering		1	5	5	5	552578	4/4/06	Scott is awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	552578	4/21/05	good class, not a bad professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	2	Engineering		4	3	5	5	552578	2/16/11	This guy is great. Tests are very straight-forward. Three easy questions if you've completed the hw assignments. Also has a lot of knowledge to offer young engineers. I would highly recommend taking at least one class at RIT with this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	0	Engineering	437	1	2	2	2	552578	4/28/07	I did not like Boedo at all. I thought his tests were way too complicated and lengthy for the time given. He focused more on talking about his past jobs then teaching material at hand. I will never take another class from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	1	Engineering	101	3	2	3	3	552578	10/22/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Boedo	3.5	0	Engineering		3	1	1	2	552578	1/11/05	Was my advisor for Mech Eng and has advised me less than ANY of my other professors... I'm very disappointed with his lack of concern for my success as a student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Boehner	4.6	2	Business		4	5	5	4	1292877	3/28/13	Easy but I still learned so much
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Boehner	4.6	2	Business	102	4	5	4	4	1292877	5/23/10	GREAT professor. really cares if you learn and lots of guidance along the way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Boehner	4.6	2	Business	105	1	4	4	4	1292877	6/3/09	Very matter of fact.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Boehner	4.6	2	Business		4	5	5	5	1292877	3/6/12	Bob is such a sweet guy; he truly cares about his students and strives to make sure we all understand the content. Grades are based on case analyses (2 group, 3 individual). Participate in class by contributing quality input and you will have no trouble getting an A Highly recommended!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Boehner	4.6	2	Business	763	3	4	5	4	1292877	2/23/10	Case based class brings real world feel to this class. Definitely learned a lot without feeling overwhelmed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jasna Bogdanovska	1.5	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	2	5	1196036	11/3/08	Jasna is a new professor for Fall08. That in mind, she is horrible. Grading is inconsistent nonsense. Projects are a joke. Does not follow the curriculum. Does not show other artist's work. Does not respect students. Critiques are not helpful. Demonstrations are useless. Gives a bad reputation to adjunct profs. Avoid her until she learns to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	2	Engineering	343	4	4	5	3	1334150	2/16/13	John Bonzo was probably the best professor I've had at RIT so far, on the tests, he allows you to have a cheat sheet (final and midterm are the only tests) and he will go over topics that will appear on the tests. He makes the most of what for most people tend to consider a boring topic, plus he looks like a lumberjack. And it's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	2	Engineering		3	5	4	3	1334150	5/4/12	Bonzo is great professor, he is extremely helpful and approachable in or outside the class. He teaches 2 classes; he's great on both of them. Tests are usually based on the stuff that he says it's important. Projects and Homework usually wight more than %60 of the final grade. So, if you do them you should be fine. Recommended for any class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	1	Engineering		3	3	3	2	1334150	1/9/12	I'm stil taking his class. He doesn't explain well, be prepared to do all the homework on your own (he doesn't say how you can do it, and he don't even solve a smilier problems). - He do the Lab demo too fast, u have to ask him when you're working. Funny guy. ALL of his work is in PowerPoint. Homeworks on weekly basis.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	1334150	1/28/10	Cool dude.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	2	Engineering	343	5	3	4	1	1334150	5/21/12	easy to get an A if you just do the assignments, attendance isn't mandatory, but there are "pop" quizzes, although he usually announces them or makes it pretty obvious. quizzes are easy if you pay attention during lecture
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	0	Engineering		2	1	2	3	1334150	2/23/12	He doesn't explain well, quizzes and tests are on random things that he doesn't teach. He goes through the lab demo way too fast and doesn't help you or make sure you understand it. He doesn't give tests back so you can't look over them. The homework he assigns doesn't really relate to class. He'd be cool outside of class, but I don't recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Bonzo	3.8	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1334150	1/31/11	Teaches materials processing n computer tools for inc prod. Freakin awesome teacher. Looks like a really HOT lumberjack. Tests are pretty easy if you study. but those thirty point questions are a doozy. really sweet guy. Lab is fun and quick.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Borgerson	1.5	0	Business		2	1	2	3	1584240	5/23/11	Read Larry May's "Sharing Responsibility and write two essays on terms used in the book. She is extremely stubborn on how you write and essay to the point where written papers are not even about content. She'll also yell at you for having computers in class, when minutes later, her ringtone on her phone will go off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Borgerson	1.5	0	Business		2	1	2	3	1584240	5/23/11	Read Larry May's "Sharing Responsibility and write two essays on terms used in the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Borkholder	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1082912	5/28/08	My second time with Robin, loved her as much as the first. While the course material was sometimes challenging, she presented it perfectly, especially in it's application to the real world. She gives excellent feedback regarding room for improvement and her door is usually open if you have questions. Don't leave RIT without taking a class from her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Borkholder	5.0	2	Engineering	401	5	5	5	3	1082912	12/26/07	Prof. Borkholder is my favorite professor in the IE department. She is very helpful and pays close attention to how much the people in her class care about what she's saying, and modifies her lectures appropriately. She makes sure that someone is available, either her or her TA, 5 days a week to take your questions. Overall, an excellent teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	208	3	4	4	4	1105257	2/25/13	Very knowledgeable and has decent lectures, but the projects and labs can be quite challenging unless you keep up. He's kind of strict on grading, but is certainly willing to help as long as you ask for it. There's certainly some self-teaching required when projects are being completed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	302	3	5	4	4	1105257	2/6/13	Had Borrelli for 210 as well. Teaches at a fast pace but consistently checks to make sure everyone is understanding the material (speak up!), Answers all questions and is very enthusiastic about the course material. Anyone who complains is one of those who sits in the back on reddit the whole time. 9/10 would take again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	208	5	3	4	3	1105257	2/16/12	Pretty dull teacher. Basically if your read the textbook section(even though not needed) you will learn 10x better then from him. Slept through almost every class, read through his slide and textbook, got A . Also, pretty tough grader..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	208	3	3	4	4	1105257	4/27/11	Did go a bit fast through the power points, but everything was on myCourses. Good teacher, knew what he was talking about. Kept the class interesting. I recommend him. His speed may not benefit new programmers, but good overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	4	1105257	10/27/10	I felt like I was at an educational comedy show - AWESOME teacher, extremely enthusiastic. If you fall behind you might not get back up - he talks very fast. If you're paying attention you'll love it - if you could care less, you'll hate him and his constant humor/enthusiasm. No wiggle room with grading, so if you cant match his enthusiasm: avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	1	1105257	3/10/10	He talks really fast!! I can hardly keep up with him. He isn't very helpful when you need him or even ask any questions based on the subject. I felt overwhelmed! He seems to focus on how good he looks and how smart he is. I wouldn't recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	123	5	5	5	5	1105257	8/26/09	Had Borrelli for all three CS classes. Each consisted of a weekly lab, participation and a couple exams. Looking back, it's hard to believe I learned so much in one year. Borrelli was an excellent teacher and his love of the subject helps everyone learn a bit more. Unfortunately my classmates were a little thick and he had to slow down sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	1	Information Technology	101	2	2	4	4	1105257	10/23/08	very lively classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	123	4	5	3	4	1105257	7/29/08	He's a really nice guy and is more than willing to help. He does rely on the slide show maybe too heavily, but I expect that will change with experience. His tests are fair, and the feedback is helpful and PROMPT (but still accurate). Guy had our final graded within an hour or two (all 3 quarters). Show up to class, ask questions and u'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology		1	1	2	3	1105257	5/18/08	Avoid like the plague. Very high standards for an intro scripting course for IT majors. Expect ANY assignment to be graded like a test, including ICEs. Most examples are skipped in class due to time constraints. ICEs (In class exercises) are done completely outside the classroom. Uh? He doesn't grade ICEs, graders do. Avoid unless you can script.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	212	4	5	5	4	1105257	2/17/13	His class is not an easy A, but with some work you should be able to make it happen. If you trouble with code he will provide you with all the necessary help. Overall I had a good experience in this class and would take a class with Borrelli again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	302	3	5	5	3	1105257	2/6/13	Great professor, exams may be difficult but he is always asking if anyone has questions or needs help during lecture. Some people say he moves fast, but he is willing to slow down if you do not understand. One of the best professors at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	3	1105257	5/17/11	He is the man. He's always happy, has a great passion for the subjects he teaches, and imparts information to the students. Every time I asked for help he was prompt and helpful. His course work is a bit on the difficult side, but you learn a lot and can get an A with some elbow grease.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology	214	2	1	3	1	1105257	11/15/10	He goes to fast. He is more sutiable for kids who have a background in programming. If you have no idea about programming AVOID, get someone else
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	212	3	5	5	4	1105257	7/5/10	This guy is crazy awesome. He goes fast, really fast. You have to keep up. Especially since there is no book you have to stay on top of his Labs, Homeworks and course examples, do not fall behind, the tests are hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology	212	5	5	5	3	1105257	3/8/10	Borrelli is great! He presents the material clearly and enthusiastically. He's usually available to answer questions either in his office or through email and he always gives you a helpful answer. If you pay attention and do the work you shouldn't have a hard time getting an A. I learned a LOT more in his class than I did in all others combined.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology		4	4	5	5	1105257	12/4/08	Borrelli is a great guy, you will learn a lot in his class if you pay attention. Those who complained probably just didn't try and are whining after the fact. His lectures are very enthusiastic and clear, and there is hardly any homework. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	4	1105257	10/14/08	.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	2	Information Technology		2	4	4	4	1105257	5/23/08	Good professor and fair grader if you show and do the expected work. The poor comments given were probably by those who cheated, didn't show up to class, or suck at life and just plained failed on their own. He is the most fair grader I've ever had, took off points where it was deserved and admitted he was wrong if he took points off where it wasn'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	2	1105257	5/18/08	Really strict grade, will lose points if you find another way to solve a problem other than what he figured out. Just reads slides, no examples, HW on things you never learned. Gives you a 0 on assignments if he thinks you worked with another student to figure it out. AVOID
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology		1	2	1	4	1105257	4/23/08	Take at your own risk. Gives homework on things you have not even learned. There are many different ways to do his assignments do to the lack of clarity, if you do not do them the way he would have he takes off a large percentage. NOT a good teacher never again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology	360	1	1	3	3	1105257	2/23/08	Inadequate professor who just reads of the slides and does not know about the material he is suppose to teach. Also, he is a unfair grader and goes straight by the book. Expect to get at most a C. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Borrelli	3.5	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	4	1105257	2/23/08	The professor is a PHD drop out who has no real world experience and doesn't understand the topic. The students know more about the field than he does. He just reads from his slides which is something that RIT strives to avoid. If you can, avoid this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J.P Bourget	1.7	1	Networking Security & Systems	421	3	3	3	3	1688822	2/27/12	Would like to point out that Bourget has never taught SysAdmin 1 until this Winter. There's a 50-50 shot he may be better with the material next quarter- but that his attitude towards students is pretty much guaranteed to be the same. Definitely not a people person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J.P Bourget	1.7	0	Networking Security & Systems	421	1	1	1	1	1688822	1/28/12	This teacher was inconsiderate and downright awful at the material. I would recommend this teacher, avoid at all possible cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J.P Bourget	1.7	0	Networking Security & Systems	421	1	1	1	1	1688822	2/4/12	Avoid like the plague.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	290313	2/19/13	Awesome teacher! Took him for a class and loved learning from Professor Bowen. He is really educated and does know what he is talking about. I recommend this teacher for any psychology class taught by him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		2	5	4	3	290313	10/23/11	Good professor, nice guy. Uses textbook for all exams. If you study the book itself you will do fine. Uses a big curve. Grade is made up of 3 exams and 1 paper. Lectures are overhead projectors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		4	5	4	4	290313	9/6/11	I love Dr. Bowen. He's always happy to help you with whatever you need and he is a very easy grader. All of the notes are online and he gives you test study guides.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology	446	4	5	4	4	290313	2/9/11	I really don't understand why people left bad reviews of him. So what if he uses a projector. Anyway, yes his test are hard but if you study the book like crazy you will do well. I think he is adorable and seems like a really sweet guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology	446	2	1	3	4	290313	1/25/11	Painfully boring lecture. Used overhead projector at a skewed angle which made it impossible to read anything he put up. Refused to try any technological upgrades the class suggested to him just so we could see the slides. Tests are extremely difficult but were based directly off the text. Cannot pass this class if you do not read the text.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		5	2	3	3	290313	5/5/10	Tests are easy (as long as you look through the vocab a few times) as he curves a 75% to an A on each test. Very boring class though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology	210	1	1	3	4	290313	2/4/10	Bowen is boring! His lectures are basically only good for napping through. He lets you out of class a half hour early every day and you watch videos almost everyday. Other good thing is attendance boosts your grade. 3 hard tests are the only grades. In order to do well in this class you MUST read the book (100-150 pages per week).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology	101	5	2	3	2	290313	10/21/09	Intro to Psychology. Very easy. Just three exams (multiple choice), super curved, and no homework, classwork or quizzes. His lectures are boring, and you really don't need to go to class because everything is in the book, including the exam questions. :/ It's an easy A, but if you really want to learn psych, don't take this memorization class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		3	1	5	2	290313	2/26/08	Hard to rate, he will sometimes talk for like a minute or two about the subject, other than that, his TAs do all the work. If you are good at reading for understanding, it shouldn't be too hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		5	2	3	3	290313	11/1/07	Don't sign up for a Self-Instruction course if you don't like "his 'self teach' method," you idiot. Didn't see much of the guy, mostly just interacted with his graduate student drones. If you can effectively teach yourself, take PSI, if you can't teach yourself, you'll be miserable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		3	3	4	2	290313	3/22/12	painfully, PAINFULLY BORING lecture. Tests are quite hard, uses the fine print in the text so you really need the book. you can skip many classes since he doesn't usually take attendance and test are right from the book. Nice guy, but super boring class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology	443	4	4	5	4	290313	10/17/11	He's a really nice guy! He makes jokes and is pretty straightforward. Yes, he does read straight from overheads, but his slides are helpfully condensed sections of the book, of which he gives you access to so they are basically study guides so you don't have to read the entire thing. Long tests are made easy if you just study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		3	4	4	4	290313	3/9/11	Nice professor, not a harsh grader. Study the assigned chapters and you should be fine. Nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		3	2	3	5	290313	1/27/11	Everything said below is true. I would just add that Bowen is a funny guy and very cute just like a teddy bear. He shook everyones hands at the end of the final.Found it very sweet of him. HOWEVER!!! don't think about taking his class. He has this great ability of making u tired and sleepy right after class starts. He must be a great grandpa!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology	514	4	1	5	2	290313	1/19/11	I Have him for psych of personality he lectures straight from the text book. Class is boring but attendance is some what mandatory. He gives about 3 exams worth 96% of your grade. Its multiple choice... On the plus side he gives a huge curve... a C is like an A in his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology	101	4	1	2	3	290313	2/20/10	I hope you can find a better teacher than this. He teaches right from the book. his lectures were with an old projector and unorganized hand written slides (learn powerpoint idiot). 3 tests with huge curve, you need to study but they're not that hard. he doesnt grade b/c hes too lazy, you sit in the front and grade (no you can't really cheat)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology		1	1	1	1	290313	2/1/10	This professor is dry as he can be. He reads from the outline shown on the overhead. He just repeats himself. Hardly have to do reading. Grades on a BIG curve for tests. Basically it'd be 75-100 -considered an A for one test. Never would take him again and I don't recommend him! Also, for those who are deaf/hard of hearing, his movies aren't CC'ed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology		3	1	2	2	290313	11/29/08	This professor is a waste of time. When I took intro to psych with him, he had his grad student do all the work. He didn't bother to invest his time in the class, he rather pawn all his work off on his grad students. A terrible introduction to psychology. Something I was once interested in, I now have no interest in pursuing farther. Terrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		4	2	4	3	290313	11/6/07	Nice guy, clear spoken. As others have said, the PSI class is all self-taught. If you can't learn by reading and teaching yourself, don't take that class. Short movie on Monday, take a test 1-3 times Tues-Thurs. Very nice to have this flexible schedule. Great class, and Bowen is a nice guy. He doesn't teach though... maybe talks 10 minutes a week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		5	3	3	3	290313	5/22/07	I took Psych PSI with Bowen. All classes are optional. Monday you watch a movie that can be found online. Tue-Thur you take a 20 question quiz on the same chapter. So each week you have three chances to take a quiz on the same material. A lot of questions repeat from test to test. Labs for the class are done on your own time and take 20 minutes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		3	3	3	2	290313	10/31/06	he's a fine professor, but it's mostly the class that i loved. you read on your own and have the opportunity to take 3 different 20-point multiple choice quizzes. and class only lasts about 20-30 minutes. really easy grade if you stay on top of the readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		2	2	3	1	290313	12/21/05	His ta's deal with his class... he comes to make sure no one is cheating and to talk for 5 mins on monday. Not really much of a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	0	Psychology		2	1	1	1	290313	11/17/04	I thought he was rude. maybe it's just me?!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	NULL	290313	3/7/04	Excellent professor, lectures can lull you to sleep because of the subject itself does not interest you- but to some others its just purely interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	1	Psychology		3	1	4	3	290313	9/14/06	I have nothing against Bowen at all, he seems like a pretty decent guy, but i really hate that class. Its not that i'm not interested in that class, because i am. Its just that I dont like his "self-teach" method. What the heck are we paying him for?!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		4	4	4	5	290313	11/20/04	this dude rocks. even though i didn't get to hear his lecture because it was a personal study course, he seems like he'd be interesting. he's so cool, he prolly rides a motorcycle to work. in the snow. while on fire. and eating live chipmunks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		3	5	5	3	290313	10/30/04	a great professor...get him if you need this liberal art credit.his test only has multiple choice!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bowen	3.1	2	Psychology		4	4	4	NULL	290313	11/18/03	extremely dull class, very nice man though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	331	4	5	5	5	15091	12/10/12	I really enjoyed this class. Projects and ICEs were very time consuming but it is a fun class. He teaches the topics and answers questions well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	331	3	5	5	4	15091	5/17/12	Firm but fair. Very available, and encourages questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	4	15091	3/2/12	I've taken a couple of classes with Boyle now, and I've never had a serious problem with him. He's a fun guy and he tries to be helpful and interesting -- if you're willing to put in some level of effort, you'll get a good grade. Grading can be a little random, but I've certainly experienced worse in the IT department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	320	4	4	5	4	15091	1/29/12	Good teacher, keeps lectures interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	5	15091	11/28/11	Great professor, he really knows the material well. He is also very enthusiastic about the web. The projects have straightforward instructions. As long as you follow said instructions, you will do well in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	4	15091	10/25/11	He's a good professor. He knows his web design and development stuff and he explains everything thoroughly like what to do and what not to do when you make a website. He likes to put in his own opinions from what he has seen. Responds to emails within an hour or two. He is a slightly hard grader but if you follow his instructions, you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	3	15091	3/16/10	This guy is obsessed with HCI and loves to hear his own voice. he is so boring to listen to and all the projects are usually due the next week which is ridiculous for the amount of work he requires to get an A. He is the worst grader as well, definitely agree with the comment before this, grades are so random.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	0	Information Technology		2	1	3	1	15091	2/8/05	He just plain sucks, you might as not go to class since you will not learn anything. Also a harsh grader because we're not Director/Flash wizes like he is. He should be fired
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	331	3	4	5	4	15091	11/14/12	Second time having him. Fair grader, interesting and challenging projects given. Learn through example code, few lecture slides. Clear and knows what he is talking about. No walk in the park course though. ICEs and projects were VERY time consuming! Overall fun challenging interesting course. Learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	425	4	5	3	5	15091	3/7/12	Given the topic of the course, I was highly annoyed w/ all the incorrect info in the syllabus (ie. due dates). Besides that, good teacher. I almost died several times doing the boring ass readings but overall, assignments were a BREEZE. Only 'studying' I did: recorded the exam review lecture, brush up on unfamiliar topics 2 days before, got a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	331	5	5	5	5	15091	2/6/12	I have taken 3 classes with Sean. IMM, HCI1 and Flash. He's an awesome teacher and very helpful at the office hours. I learned a lot from his classes. He gives examples unlike other professors who only go through the slides. Sean is the man!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	4	15091	12/1/11	Simply amazing teacher, will work with you, is extremely funny and helpful. If I ever get the chance to take him again I will. During exercises hes more then willing to help you solve problems. He is a fair grader and you couldn't ask for anything more in a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology	331	4	5	4	4	15091	11/17/11	Cool guy. Can be a strict grader at times but as long you follow the grade sheet, you will be fine. Responses to email within an hour which is a big plus for me. Gives plenty of time for projects. Overall, I would recommend him for Flash.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	2	Information Technology		4	4	4	4	15091	2/2/11	Very willing to help during office hours and also very helpful over email. He grades a little tough but not that bad.I recommend this teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Boyle	4.0	0	Information Technology	409	3	1	1	3	15091	1/16/06	This professor was absolutely awful. I am an a hard working student, but you can't learn a damn thing when your teacher shows up for class, throws up someone else's pre-made lecture slides and tutorials, again that he did not create...and says go figure it out. I'm willing to work hard for good grades but this professor is the****tiest at RIT!!!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Bradley	4.2	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	1277337	2/27/12	I had her for Intermediate ASL I. Probably the best professor I've had for ASL. She's extremely nice and genuinely cares about her students (and ensures that they understand everything!). She jokes around a lot in class, which can be pretty funny. The tests were not difficult, but they are pretty comprehensive. Great professor, would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Bradley	4.2	1	Languages		4	3	3	4	1277337	4/26/09	She is very nice and she comes up with some great activities. She can be hard to understand at times, but if you ask her to repeat and slow down she will. Fair grader. More work than ASL I. Book is required to do all the hw. If you miss more than 3 classes your grade drops down 1 letter grade. So go to class. overall good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Bradley	4.2	2	Languages	101	2	5	4	5	1277337	6/19/09	I had her for both ASL I and ASL III. She is a very fair grader, and if you have a problem, she is more then willing to meet with you to figure a solution. She is very sweet, and teaches the subject very well. Her criticism is very constructive, and tells you what you do well, and how you can improve. I would definitely take a class with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	2	Sign Language		3	5	4	4	1629700	3/28/13	Prof. Briggs is a great professor! She moves quickly through class but is completely willing to repeat herself as many times as needed. There's a lot of practice in class which prepares you perfectly for her exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	2	Sign Language		4	4	3	4	1629700	3/13/12	Tests are cumulative and may contain signs that are not covered in the textbook but are considered in class. Class could be annoying because we would spend a lot of time practicing. If you have a strong pictorial memory, then you should do fine in ASL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	2	Sign Language	390	4	5	3	2	1629700	12/12/11	Professor Briggs is a great ASL teacher and exhibits the immense patience of the Deaf community. I had her for ASL1 and she seemed like the perfect fit. My only complaint is that her one of her assignments was slightly unclear; it was difficult to obtain an article we were supposed to read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	2	Sign Language		4	5	4	3	1629700	3/5/13	Professor Briggs was a great teacher and she was always willing to help you in class if you were having difficulty understanding a sign or topic. I would highly recommend any student to her. Also, she has a working dog with her that is absolutely adorable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	0	Sign Language		1	1	1	3	1629700	3/7/12	Each absence is 10% off your final grade. Don't take a class with this teacher. She is way too strict and the class is boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Briggs	3.4	1	Sign Language	391	4	2	4	4	1629700	10/22/11	Good Teacher, not great. She knows her signs and is a Deaf professor and like all ASL teachers is very good at communicating with lower level signs. She is very strict for grammar which I think is a plus. Her tests are fairly easy, but inconsistent difficulty from test to test. Recommend this teacher, but I know there are others who are better
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	64611	3/27/13	Hands down the best math teacher I have ever had. Canadian, so you know he is insanely nice. Bags of milk and rivers of chicken fat... lol (insider)... "I stop and I ask how does this sit with you and you say...?" ... "Plain vanilla"... "Add one to the exponent divide by whats up top... now that your safely outside the bottle neck of integration."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	64611	11/27/12	Great teacher with a good sense of humor. Would definitely recommend taking him as a teacher. NO GROUP PROJECT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	64611	4/3/12	He is the best teacher I've ever had throughout my education. He doesn't have favorites, rarely praises individual work (a good thing), and doesn't discriminate against slackers. He is very lenient with giving points on exams. Also, he spends the break (10 min) helping people and answering questions. He also answers questions during the lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	64611	12/14/11	Great guy; explains things the same way that students think. How does that sit with you? Love his sense of humor as well :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	5	4	64611	10/8/11	Canadian Professor is absolutely fantastic. I am terrible at math and he made complex integrals seem within the realm of reasonable computation. =P Also, he is hilarious. If you don't pick up on Canadian humor you'll miss it, but Canadian Professor cracked me up all quarter. Every other thing he says is an easily missed joke. Fair grader. Take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics	123	4	4	5	2	64611	3/5/10	Took him for multivariable calculus, great guy, funny, easy teacher. What more do you want?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	64611	9/5/09	Easily the best teacher at RIT

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics	242	4	5	5	5	64611	5/3/05	Great Professor. Has great stories to tell to lighten things up, and shows his passion for mathematics clearly. However, I'm still not sure what he means when he says "sit side by each." Must be a Canadian thing... Highly reccommended, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	64611	9/1/04	great "prof"... now "how does that sit with you?"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	64611	2/13/13	An outstanding professor. Explains concepts in much the way I think. Appropriate for the whole spectrum  will not bore the best students or leave the worst behind. Will help you the best he can. Funky grading scheme where 80% of the grade is from 2 tests (or one is you choose to skip the optional mid-term).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics	282	4	5	5	4	64611	9/18/12	Honestly the best professor I've ever had, explained concepts beautifully and had a great sense of humor to boot. I had him for two quarters and looked forward to his class every time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	64611	1/29/12	Brooks is easily the best professor i've had while at RIT. He is very helpful, willing to re-explain anything during class if you ask, and during workshop he will help you. He tends to ask further questions to make you think about it more, instead of providing the answers. He lets you go early a lot of the time and is very laid back and funny!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	64611	10/13/11	Awesome teacher. Very good at answering questions. I transferred from a different Calc class into his because I heard he was fantastic. The rumors were accurate. Take good notes and study your notes before tests and you will do fine. Great sense of humor and an interesting guy to talk to! Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	64611	10/19/10	He's a good teacher! I was registered late and my advisor fit my schedule for the first quarter so I didn't know most of my professors before attending class for the first time. Now I feel I'm so lucky to have him as my calculus teacher!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	64611	1/22/10	BEST TEACHER +EVER@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WISH HE WAS MY DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	64611	1/30/08	Great prof. Gives optional homework every night, and a quick 2-3 minute quiz every class. Great for helping your grade. Teaches by example and is rather clear in said examples. Been waiting for another chance to take a class with him...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	64611	5/16/06	He is a wonderful professor, that gives a lot of examples. If you learn by example, and not with theory first, this is the professor to have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	5	3	64611	4/7/05	Major Hottie
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	64611	4/7/04	Great teacher, lots of fun. Seems like that great high school teacher you never got to have. Fair tests and great class structure
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernard Brooks	4.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	NULL	64611	2/4/04	He's super helpful and clear. He's kinda quirky tho, he'll ask you "how does that sit with you?" or tell you to mumble something about the bottleneck of integration. and in canada they drink their milk from bags.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Brown	4.2	2	Social Work		5	5	5	1	1495258	11/9/11	I had her for discovery. Show up to class, complete the very easy assignments (most being posts in online discussion boards), and you will get an A. She's a pretty nice person and is interested in helping her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Brown	4.2	2	Social Work		5	3	4	1	1495258	11/13/10	Really easy to get an A in the class, but you will learn nothing useful except maybe a little information about registration. Simply a waste of an hour each week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Border	5.0	2	Information Technology	761	5	5	5	5	729683	11/14/12	Good professor and easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Border	5.0	2	Information Technology	761	5	5	5	3	729683	12/6/08	The professor is a good person and very helpful. He is not strict at all and the workload for class is not much. The last two things can be taken in a negative sense as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Border	5.0	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	729683	10/18/05	Very good teacher, energetic and easy to listen too. Cares about his students. Thumbs up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Border	5.0	2	Information Technology	101	4	5	5	4	729683	9/27/10	Very good Professor I really recomend him, he cares a lot about his students, and even after class he keeps being a friend to the student, I rate him 10/10.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Border	5.0	2	Information Technology	761	4	5	5	4	729683	11/9/08	Excellent Professor, he is a very nice guy who cares that his student perform well. He will go out of his way to make sure that students understand the material and get good grades. I fully recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Borkholder	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	481	4	4	4	3	1019042	11/12/09	Attend class or else you will get lost. He does not bother you about attendance. He is an AWESOME teacher and VERY helpful during office hours. I would love for him to be my professor again! By far the BEST EE teacher I ever had.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	1	Writing		4	2	3	4	1035991	5/18/12	DIFFERENTLY WIRED BRAINS: Definitely one of the most interesting classes I've taken at RIT. Read the book for the week and post on the given topic as well as other students' posts. Gives out three grades, heavily weighted on the discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	2	Writing	325	4	5	5	5	1035991	10/29/10	Differently Wired Brains: Not my major, but by FAR the BEST class I have ever taken, and she may be the Best Teacher in Existence!! Every day she would give us the opportunity for a 5min beak, but the whole class was always so interested that we ALWAYS voted UNANIMOUSLY to keep going. I wish I had another chance to take one of her classes again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	2	Writing		3	4	5	5	1035991	4/21/09	I took both "Language and the Brain" and "Language, Dialect, Identity" with her and thought the classes as well as Dr. Borrelli were great. It helps to be interested in linguistics. She's the only professor on campus with a degree in linguistics--very knowledgeable. I would definitely take another class with her.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	2	Writing	227	4	5	3	2	1035991	1/31/12	A bit lofty, but a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	0	Writing		3	1	1	1	1035991	4/28/09	She talks about things, acting like she knows what she's talking about but really never does. Just write the three papers according to her idiotic "lectures" and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doris Borrelli	3.6	2	Writing	101	1	3	4	1	1035991	3/16/08	this class is a joke, to start off. but she gives you at least three writen pages of homework a night plus 3 papers that have the worst subjects ever. it's 9th grade english all over again. just as painful and paintless as ever. avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bosner	4.5	2	Business		4	3	5	2	964391	8/6/10	Dr. Bosner was extremely easy to understand. Tests were online and open book, homework was graded on effort, and instead of a final exam, we had a final project. Other than that, I don't think I learned much in that class because all of the powerpoints were online prior to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Bosner	4.5	2	Business	430	3	5	5	5	964391	3/9/07	Excellent teacher; very down to earth. As long as you participate, you're getting an A. I'd like to buy this guy a beer some day. Great guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing	101	2	5	4	2	1342656	5/17/12	Great professor, kept students' interest and rarely went the full 2 hours midway through the quarter. All of the homework was from the online McGraw Hill connect program, which is GOD-AWFUL. Half the class had grade-ruining issues with the program. Luckily, Prof. Boveda said she'll stop relying on the Connect program, so she gets 10/10.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing		3	5	3	4	1342656	3/6/12	She was very helpful. As long as you asked her for what her expectation about the assignment you should be fine. Quizzes are usually easier than homework but she said otherwise. It wont matter as long as you read the book, you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing	101	3	4	4	4	1342656	9/6/11	Best teacher i have had so far, makes marketing interesting and is quite funny. Likes to interact with her student as well as class will require work esp. your marketing plan project
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing		1	4	4	3	1342656	4/24/11	Adriana (she recommends you address her by her first name) is so friendly and helpful, but the software she uses for out of class assignments is horrendous: costs $20, words questions unfairly, does not give feedback, and **GLITCHES OFTEN**. As homeworks and quizzes count for a decent portion of the final grade, be careful with them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing		3	5	4	4	1342656	5/28/10	She knows her stuff. Her class may require some of your time, but you actually learn so many things about Marketing. Very helpful outside classes. She's also VERY nice. Would recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing	363	3	4	5	4	1342656	3/13/12	Good teacher, the Connect web service she uses is terrible though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing		4	5	5	3	1342656	3/4/12	Took her for Principles of Marketing, she's a great professor! Really enjoyed her class. Very nice, kind, and helpful-funny too! I forgot to submit my homework and she let me submit it the following day with deductions. Only annoying thing all hw is online and quizzes, and they're tedious. Other than that, I highly recommend her, best professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing		4	5	4	4	1342656	5/10/11	AWESOME PROF! Take her class! Lectures=not boring at all. She uses online software for hw/quizzes. If u use grewal website they give u w/ book to help u "study", ur guaranteed 80% on hw since some activities are identical to hw online. If someone drops in ur grp that means more work on your plate, so choose ur grp members wisely.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing	101	2	5	5	4	1342656	9/10/10	She is really nice and helpful. She also is really understanding. So long as you put a little bit of work into the class then it is an easy A. Quizzes are online, and for everything she gives great guidance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adriana Boveda	4.5	2	Marketing	105	3	5	5	3	1342656	1/26/10	This professor is one of the BEST I have ever had!! She is really laid back and is just SUCH a wealth of knowledge about everything, electronics in particular. She puts up power points but just for referance. She is just AWESOME!!quizzes are hard, and you cant **** with her, she knows her****.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan  Bowen	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	5	1788613	2/2/13	Aspiring Ph.D student, first time officially teaching a class. Teaching methods were very clear, any student interested in the topic would have no issues understanding the material. He is very helpful and always available for office hours. He also has a great sense of humor while being extremely thorough with the topic at hand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan  Bowen	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	346	4	5	4	5	1788613	1/2/13	Graduate student. Enrolled in first class he ever taught. Lectures are very clear. Very good at answering questions and helping with code. Did not have a firm understanding of material he was teaching, though, and students often corrected his mistakes. HW and projects are very time consuming and he is a picky grader with reports.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science	351	1	4	4	4	1059171	11/12/12	Tough Class, definitely not an Easy A by any means. Requires a lot of work, but if you're serious about going to class and dedicate a lot of time out side of class for studying an A can be earned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		3	5	5	5	1059171	4/23/12	EXCELLENT professor. I took him for exercise science 1 & 2. He knows what he is talking about and is very helpful. Tests are hard if you don't study outside of class. He tells you exactly what to study so you should be ok. I got an A in ES 1 and am on track for A in ES2 right now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science	400	3	5	5	5	1059171	5/30/11	Very, very helpful outside of class. Tests are definitely hard, but honestly - all I did was read the chapters a few days before the exam and highlight important information, and then reread that information. I got A's for both semesters! He is an awesome an knowledgeable professor - TAKE HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science	360	3	4	5	4	1059171	3/14/11	Had him for Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2. He is quite knowledgeable and helpful and his lectures are interesting. There is so much material that in order succeed a ton of studying must occur outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		3	5	5	5	1059171	1/12/11	Awesome professor. Knows his stuff, loves A and P, and sounds like Bill Nye the science guy. Stay awake (late afternoon class) and you'll learn so much awesome info. Just start studying from day 1 and you'll get a guaranteed 'A'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		1	3	4	2	1059171	5/20/10	I don't know what everyone is thinking... his information is clear but his exams are ridiculously hard, it's like he's trying to fail everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	4	4	5	1059171	11/19/09	Funny professor and made learning about anatomy pretty interesting. Clicker ?'s were easy points if you show up to class. Tests can be really tricky but overall he's a decent teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	4	4	5	1059171	7/15/09	Good professor..he knows what he's talking about although he makes tests rediculously hard. He won't bump your grade even if your within 1 point. Very strict but i like him because of his organization and thoroughness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		4	5	5	4	1059171	2/25/09	Brewer is a great professor. He's very funny and he makes hard material easy to understand. I totally recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	5	4	4	1059171	10/16/08	Good teacher. Makes really terrible jokes that I find absolutely hilarious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		3	4	5	4	1059171	11/5/12	Dr. Brewer is a good teacher, but his class is very hard. Lots of outside studying must be done and the class runs at a very fast past. Your grade is combined with lab, so you have a better chance at getting an A. Lecture is not "mandatory" but he gives clicker quizzes for bonus points and explains hard concepts well so its worth going.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	3	4	4	1059171	11/27/11	Difficult class, a lot of time must be spent out of class studying. This is a very fast paced course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science	101	2	3	4	4	1059171	3/14/11	Nice guy but the class is def not an easy A. Lots of studying he makes you work for your grade . Tests are extremely hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		1	5	3	3	1059171	1/25/11	Lectures are interesting but do not go in depth enough to let you pass a test. Test questions come directly from the book but are challenging. Going to Bill's office hours is definitely helpful and he is clearly passionate about his subject and helping his students. He asks very easy iClicker questions at the end of each lecture for bonus points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	5	5	5	1059171	8/5/10	People complaining about how hard this class are don't study enough. He covers 90% of everything you need to know for his exams in lectures. Read the chapters. Take notes. Come to class. His tests are not unreasonably hard. He offers extra credit points in "clicker questions" which can boost your final grade by 4-5%. Very approachable and funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		1	3	4	3	1059171	12/18/09	Good teacher but the class is meh, sometimes the lectures can feel like it's just a drag. And his exams are very hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	5	5	5	1059171	11/19/09	Very through and articulate. Easy class if your motivated and interested. Brewer is a great teacher overall. He knows his stuff without a doubt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		5	5	5	5	1059171	5/18/09	Awesome class by an awesome professor. Your main work is one big presentation, and he's flexible about when you submit it. Loved this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Brewer	4.4	2	Health Science		2	5	5	4	1059171	1/27/09	Extremely good teacher, funny and very helpfunl. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	0	Philosophy		3	1	2	3	273957	3/25/13	really wish i listened to my friends and didn't take her class. other ratings were probably written by freshman.. she has been the worst phil prof I ever had at RIT..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	0	Philosophy		1	1	1	1	273957	5/29/12	HORRIBLE CLASS! AND HORRIBLE TEACHER! Made it clear she did not believe in evolution or genetics, even though the whole class was about those. Ridiculed science majors for their stands on evo and gen. If you are a bio major stay far away from this class and teacher. There were no extracredits and no drops, contrary to what others said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		2	4	5	5	273957	11/13/11	She's an awesome professor. Really sparked my interest in philosophy and strongly suggests that you read up so you are able to verify your perspective on certain subjects. She loves science and truly loves philosophy. Constantly questioning and learning so much in every class. She's. Just. Awesome. Take any class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy	509	4	5	4	2	273957	5/3/11	She is a really awesome teacher! reading can be hard to understand, but she always has class discussions/activities to help with understanding. Test/quizzes are very fair. Put thought into them and you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	3	273957	3/8/11	Upfront about the workload required of her course; grades fairly and explains herself well. Always available for help if you have questions. Very understanding if things come up. All-around great philosophy professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	1	273957	5/24/08	Loved this class because the professor was insightful and entertaining. Do the homework, come to class & participate and you will do just fine. I'm definitely a more analytical thinker thanks to this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	3	273957	4/30/08	Great Professor. Quiz about once a week, drops the lowest 3 grades. The quizzes are short and pretty easy. Leaves time free at the end of class for students who need help. No final. Overall easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	4	4	3	273957	2/4/08	Good teacher.Very nice. Usually ends class early to have "workshop" time with students who don't understand the material. At least one quiz a week, but they are very short and pretty easy. Attendance helps your understanding of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	4	3	3	273957	3/5/07	The material is kind of hard to understand unless you're good at logic. Gives a weekly quiz, no comprehensive finals or tests. Offers two possible extra credits and lots of possibilities to get them. 25% of your grade is participation/attendance, so go to class! She's a nice woman, so I'd recommend it. Don't blow off the readings though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	0	Philosophy		4	1	1	5	273957	3/14/13	WOW this woman is horrid. She has a extremely rude/condescending demeanor towards students. Just brings up very general and controversial arguments that have nothing to do with the class for the entire course. It's clear she is under-prepared and makes up things as she goes. Talks about her self all the time. Run for your life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy	210	4	4	5	3	273957	11/24/11	Her class is really interesting and fun. The readings would sometimes be hard, but she did her best to explain them. She does the midterm in week 7 and gives a review guide pretty close to what's in it. (same with final). She gives around 5 quizzes and 5 mini-essays and drops the two lowest scores. Easy A or B. Depends on your participation in clas
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy	101	3	4	4	3	273957	5/27/11	Good professor. Doesn't require much work but you learn enough for an intro class. Willing to work with students and if the class gets an overall low average she works to bump peoples grades up. Pretty easy A, she drops the two lowest grades and offers extra credit (for my class we had to watch the matrix and compare it in 3 ways to Descartes.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy	210	4	4	5	3	273957	4/26/11	Coursework is difficult to understand on your own, and textbook readings can be ambiguous, but her lectures and class discussions bring clarity to the subject. I would definitely take another class with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	3	273957	3/5/10	Great class, highly recommend her as a teacher. Interesting material and you can tell she's excited about it. Some readings were hard, but worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	4	3	1	273957	5/13/08	Decent teacher who tries to do the best for her students.. offers lots of extra credit and will drop lowest grades. No final. I would recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	2	Philosophy	505	3	5	5	4	273957	2/22/08	I came into this class with absolutely no knowledge of what critical thinking was about. She opened and enlightened me on areas of arguments and thinking in general that i thought was pointless. I enjoyed this class very much and enjoyed her teaching as well as her personality. She is a great women that is willing to help as long as you do work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	0	Philosophy		4	2	2	2	273957	3/20/07	a pretty bad teacher. but not a lot of work. do the write ups and pretend to pay attn in class and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Brister	3.6	0	Philosophy		4	1	2	NULL	273957	11/3/03	She is a bad teacher...rambles and changes subjects constantly...puts random words on the board as opposed to actual notes...knows a lot about ethics but nothing of new technology, and she is def a feminist
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Brown	1.0	0	History		1	1	1	2	959342	2/18/07	He lectures with his eyes shut, so that shows how interesting the class can get. He just gives two exams a quarter without any tests/quizzes/papers. Half of the class is asleep and rest leave right after he takes roll, puhleez don't take his class !!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	1	Computer Science	740	2	3	3	3	1455040	9/25/12	DON"T take Data Com and Networks with him!!!! projects are tough and vague, if you follow his written directions you will discover that you got C bcs your program failed to do something that wasn't written in directions. On weekend he can send an email that there will be a quiz on Mo/Tu and ask you bunch of acrons so you can lower ur grade more
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	1	Computer Science		2	3	3	5	1455040	5/17/12	He's fun and funny and understanding, but he reads off of his own notes which are powerpoint slides which are horribly vague. When prompted to explain something not quite in the notes, his answer was vague and unhelpful. The projects are pretty intense and rewarding if you get them to work, but he gives next to no guidance on doing them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	440	3	5	5	4	1455040	2/28/12	Great professor, one of the best I've had in the department and at RIT for that matter. Fun in lecture, fair grader. Five homeworks, midterm, final, and two projects make up a big part of the course. Allows cheat sheets during exams, and has opportunity for bonus on both projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	450	3	5	4	5	1455040	10/19/11	Good professor, really friendly and makes class fun. His assignments can be hard, but he's not a very tough grader. His tests can be a bit tricky but he lets you use a cheat sheet. Overall, I think he's one of the best CS profs at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	440	4	4	3	4	1455040	7/7/11	Friendly and jocular, grades leniently and helps you if you come to him. Sadly not enough labs in this class, you are given a hell project just like in CS4. However his exams (midterm and final) aren't that bad if you study, his lectures are fast but light, and if you put forth moderate effort you can get a B or A in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	1455040	5/17/12	Really awesome teacher! Had him for Data Comm I and OSI. Really helpful if you actually ask. Projects can sometimes be tough, but they definitely make you learn the material (especially in OS)! Tests were moderately difficult, but overall not too bad. I'd definitely recommend taking Brown for any class you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	440	5	5	5	5	1455040	3/13/12	Fun and interactive class if you are interested in operating systems. Tests were on the easy side, but projects are a lot of work. The material is presented in a simplified and understandable way that drives concepts home. Spent a little too much time giving help on the project in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	440	3	5	5	5	1455040	11/11/11	Had for OS1. For the average student his class will kick your butt if you procrastinate. Homeworks and tests are easy. The two projects are the meat and potatoes of the course. Work at it early, and often. Ask questions in class. Use your resources. This will be one of the best courses you take at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Brown	4.2	2	Computer Science	440	3	4	4	4	1455040	7/10/11	One of the more open and friendly professors in the CS department. His lectures are taught at a good pace so you will not feel lost most of the time, and if you do he won't bash you for asking him to repeat something. Quite a fair grader. Assignments can be tough, book is useful, overall good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Brown	3.1	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	1632508	1/31/13	He was super helpful with labs. Doesn't make you follow the template. Way easier than any other chem lab professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Brown	3.1	1	Chemistry		5	3	3	5	1632508	2/1/12	Steve's pretty chill and his grading is pretty fair. He's pretty funny and likes to joke around
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Brown	3.1	0	Chemistry	205	1	1	1	5	1632508	10/28/11	Had him for chem lab. His class was so difficult. Difficult to understand. If you have him, you should drop him immediately. Take another person for chem lab!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Brown	3.1	1	Chemistry		2	2	3	4	1632508	10/28/12	Nine hours of homework a week is normal, spaced out its manageable, but its not likely you'll always have the time to do it bit by bit. Any question you have for him is answered, "What does myCourses say?" Tests are really hard, but allows a cheat sheet. Recitation questions are really hard, and he does a mediocre job explaining things then.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Brown	3.1	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	1	1632508	1/27/12	Fun class to have. He's laid back and cracks jokes all of the time. Labs are easy and lab reports are much simpler than others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Brule	3.9	1	Criminal Justice		3	2	4	3	9107	11/10/05	Incredibly boring. He's a big talker and likes to repeat a lot of things. Exams are kinda ridiculous, ALL T/F questions? Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Brule	3.9	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	9107	9/19/05	I've had him once, i've had him 4 times. This man is animated, funny, and makes good points. Active in the student body and community. Really one of the few interesting professors at a really boring technical school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Brule	3.9	2	Criminal Justice		5	4	4	3	9107	10/21/04	So easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Brule	3.9	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	NULL	9107	5/15/04	DONE TO EARTH, understanding, straight foward, real kind of guy. He even swears!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Brule	3.9	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	NULL	9107	5/26/03	AT times boring, but easy and clear to understand

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Bubacz	2.8	0	Engineering		2	1	2	1	733037	2/5/06	give him a lot of BS and he'll eat it up. I'm still unclear about what we did in the class at the end of the quarter
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	3	4	5	5	907106	12/11/11	He would work with all the students one-on-one if needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	1	2	5	4	907106	5/31/11	A very good professor and prepares us for the real-world
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	0	Management		3	2	2	2	907106	2/10/09	by far the worst teacher i have ever had.. i dont know how these people are saying hes great. He plays favorites and his grading is completely based of that. I have never been as angry with a teacher as i was with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	2	5	5	3	907106	9/26/08	He is very insightful and I have learned a lot. I have a position now paying me 75K because of what I learned about SAP
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	0	Management		3	3	1	1	907106	5/28/08	I totally agree with the post below. He will play favorites and give them a curve on quizzes, workshops or midterms. Oh yeah, he knows everything about everything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	270	5	5	5	3	907106	10/30/06	Come to class. Do work on time. Get easy A! Class is no sweat!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	3	5	5	4	907106	12/11/11	He brings a lot or real world experience
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	2	5	5	3	907106	2/12/09	very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	2	Management	315	2	5	5	4	907106	11/29/08	very good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	0	Management		1	2	2	2	907106	9/16/08	Horrible. Very harsh, plays favorites as mentioned before, and lectures are really hard to understand and gets ticked off when students don't understand. Avoid if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Bucciarelli	3.7	0	Management		5	2	1	2	907106	5/22/08	His lectures are incomprehensible. He views students as either perfect, or the worst that he has ever seen. Your grades will either be 100% or 70%, no in between. For most, this class is an easy A, but don't expect to learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science	252	4	5	4	5	246564	11/28/11	Really engaging, dedicated professor. Loves iguanas. Very open to students coming to his office with questions and concerns. Makes powerpoints available online and provides test questions ahead of time. Tests are based on concept application and are all multiple choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		3	5	5	5	246564	10/4/11	Amazing teacher, loves iguanas, gorgeous man, great with pre-vet students, very into biology, very beautiful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	1	Science		3	3	3	4	246564	11/24/10	he takes points off just to take points off. he is looking for a single memorized answer on exams and it is one he said, your answer may be correct or in the book but if it's not what he said won't get credit. he warns students not to debate over points, however, so seems to be getting away with this.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		4	5	5	5	246564	10/20/09	He's friendly and he loves iguanas. What more could you hope for out of an evolutionary biology professor?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science	365	5	4	5	4	246564	10/24/08	Pretty good teacher in that he conveys his information well. Is constantly late to class (up to 10+ mins) and takes forever to grade tests bc "he has a life on the weekend" which I found a bit rude. Lets stupid 2nd years ask way too many dumb questions and lets them detract from the lecture material so we are 2 or 3 weeks behind. Overall ok teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		4	5	5	5	246564	11/13/06	Dr. Buckley is an excellent teacher. He presents the material clearly, makes his good powerpoint notes available online, always makes himself available outside of class, is enthusiastic about what he teaches, and is just a really nice guy. I highly recommend that you take a course from him if you get the chance. He is pretty entertaining too :)

Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		4	5	5	NULL	246564	9/10/03	Class is not as boring as other bio classes. He really cares about teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		4	5	4	5	246564	10/11/11	loves iguanas
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	1	Science		2	4	2	3	246564	4/5/11	Dr.Buckley is mostly a good teacher. Although his tests are not related to his lectures, he does give you the questions ahead of time. Also, your always behind on lectures, because he gets overly excited about certain topics, but its not necessarily a bad thing. Overall its an easy B!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science	101	1	4	4	3	246564	11/15/09	If your going to take evolutionary biology with him, be prepared to memorize the chapters of the book word for word in major detail. Worst class ever, i learned nothing, all memorization.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		2	5	5	5	246564	9/2/09	Has an intense biological background, he's like a BioWikipedia. Awesome, amazing professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		2	5	5	5	246564	4/23/08	An absolutely amazing teacher and advisor. He gives you as much respect as you give him, and it was easy to find interest in his class because he is fascinated with it and it shows in his lecutes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		2	4	4	2	246564	11/1/05	Such a nice guy and pretty good teacher. Get's very into what he's talking about. Only grades depend on very long essay tests and one big lab project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Buckley	4.5	2	Science		5	5	5	NULL	246564	10/31/03	Very nice!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Bullinger	3.0	0	Engineering	441	2	1	3	4	1640927	3/5/12	Had him for Principles of Concurrent Systems. While getting a good grade isn't very hard, he taught the course quite poorly. He lectured directly from slides. Many projects he assigned were vaguely defined but graded rather harshly. I barely learned anything about the subject. Would not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Bullinger	3.0	2	Engineering	663	3	3	5	4	1640927	11/9/11	Had him for real-time & Embedded Systems. Very understanding, and fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics		1	1	4	4	732112	4/9/13	Horrible class. The teacher is a decent person but tests are impossible. The fact that they count for 90% of the grade makes them even worse. Do not take Macro with him, you will kill yourself trying to get a C or B, not worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	211	3	3	4	1	732112	11/20/12	Fairly decent teacher if you can stand to be bored to death with endless irrelevant examples. Knows what he's talking about, but often degrades into random stories that only vaguely tie into the topic. Slept through most of the class and still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics	211	1	3	2	1	732112	10/14/12	Often goes off on tangents. Has horrible handwriting that is difficult to read. Tests are extremely difficult, but has a large curve. Isn't clear on when assignments are due. Very discouraging class but a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	211	1	1	2	3	732112	3/5/12	Absolutely awful professor. Draws messy diagrams and often goes on tangents. Online notes are more concise. Exam multiple choice questions are needlessly difficult (I would ace part 2, but bomb multiple choices). Corrections require you provide a reason for every MC question (even if you got it right), and you aren't told which you got wrong. Avoid
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics	511	1	4	1	2	732112	4/26/11	Teaches very poor, tests are very hard , but he is so helpful. Homework isn't a big deal to him. not recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	402	1	1	1	2	732112	10/20/10	Horrible! Pick a different teacher! He has no idea what he is doing or how to teach!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	211	1	4	4	1	732112	6/14/10	Burnett is a really intense teacher, but I learned so much from him. Grades consist of homework assignments and a few tests, which are 20 multiple choice and 2 short answers. The tests are tricky, but you get to correct your test to get points back. If you want to really learn Micro, I recommend him; if you want an easy A find another professor. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	511	1	2	2	1	732112	3/13/10	I would recommend every person to stay away from this professor. He himself is a distraction. I went to all of his classes and I fall asleep because his jokes suck and he teaches everyone as if they know economics from middle school.. If you have a PHd in microeconomics then I would recommend to take him, otherwise gooooood luck
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		2	4	5	5	732112	2/3/10	Professor Burnette is an excellent teacher. He gives very little homework and it is typically easy. His tests are difficult but with some studying and re-reading of your notes it shouldn't be to hard to get an A. He curves his grades and allows test corrections on all major exams. I will certainly be taking his classes again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		2	5	5	1	732112	1/21/10	Really good teacher, jokes sometimes, yes his tests are hard but you really come out knowing what's what. I would recommend him, it's a struggle, but little homework only 3 tests. Fun class discussions too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics		3	3	3	3	732112	2/19/13	Every in class example pertains to beer or fast food. What more could you ask?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	402	1	2	1	3	732112	11/14/12	This class is terrible. He has horrible handwriting, nothing on the board makes sense, he spends most of class time talking about useless things, and then the exams and quizzes are impossible. He does have a large grading curve but do yourself a favor and take someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		1	3	4	3	732112	5/21/12	not the easiest class, but if you really understand and like econ, and take initiative to ask help, and learn the material, you should do fine. fyi, he has a grading curve
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		3	5	4	5	732112	8/3/11	Did go off topic a little but gave material to help practice and was easy to talk to. He tried to fit to your schedule if you had questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	211	4	5	3	5	732112	2/3/11	he uses his experience to teach economic concepts. funny guy and a very good professor. However, I can understand that some people will not understand his concepts because he makes you think for yourself. Excellent professor for micro and macro but not for an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	101	1	1	2	3	732112	10/15/10	if you need to take macro, DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HIM. trust me. this class was ridiculously hard and just horrible overall. he doesnt teach he just writes messy notes and graphs on the board that he never explains. the exams are impossible..class avg was a 54. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	1	1	2	732112	5/22/10	DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. He always gets distracted by talking about irrelevant things, never answered my emails when I asked for help, his diagrams are messy, our class average was a 56. His tests are 20 multiple questions and 2 short answer. The final is 40 percent of your grade.worst teacher I've ever had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	441	1	5	4	4	732112	2/28/10	Awesome teacher to learn from. If you see him in office hours he is more than willing to help you clear up any problems you have with the class material. His optional research paper is a great opportunity to boost your grade and learn more material. I would take a class from him again any time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	210	2	5	4	3	732112	2/3/10	Little homework and it's usually easy. The tests are very hard in comparison to the homework. If you don't want to put in A LOT of effort studying, even if he curves a lot, you probably won't end up with the grade you want. Overall, he is helpful and reasonable. If you want a challenge, this professor is for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	101	1	4	3	2	732112	12/15/09	Classes are pretty interesting. He allows a lot of people to participate which will bring up your grade. Homeworks are really easy. Tests are ridiculously hard, but he curves them but letting you do corrections and lowering an A to about an 80.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		2	5	4	5	732112	5/18/09	Great teacher! If you want to learn economics take him. His tests are hard but he curves it accordingly, he's more interested in making sure the students understand the material. He's very helpful outside the classroom. I'd say he's a must take if you want to be challenged or are going into anything with economics!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	101	3	5	4	4	732112	3/31/09	I took Dr. Burnette for Intro for Macroeconomics and Macroeconomics. I was able to pull off an A in both classes. His exams consist of 3 parts: multiple choice, short answer(written response), essay questions(math problems). Pay attention, go to office hours, do homework, study before tests and you are guaranteed an A. Good Luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics	211	2	3	3	1	732112	11/19/08	Difficult class, but there is a HUGE curve, so if you actually go to class and pay attention, you will do fine. MC sections on tests are difficult because they aren't discussed much in class, but you have a chance after the test to get half the points you lost on MC back. Essay sections are easy if you payed attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics	211	1	3	3	4	732112	11/14/08	very hard class. very hard to get an A. if you work hard it will be worth it. He gives big curves to his grades. Writes a lot of sloppy notes on board but gives good online notes. Would recommend if u want a challenge
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics		1	3	2	1	732112	10/22/08	He is very very tough. His exams will contain nothing of what he thought in his class. Grades homework and class participation but you will notice that no one actually can participate. I agree he has a lot of knowledge, but I guess student are here to learn. they havn't done economics ever before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	2	2	1	732112	10/14/08	Hardest class I've had at RIT, and I'm well into computer science. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	402	1	1	2	2	732112	5/5/08	This guy is ridiculous. His notes sometimes contradict what it says in the book, which is evident in the tests. The class doesn't seem that hard until the tests, then you feel extremely violated. If you like to pull your hair out, by all means take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	2	1	4	732112	3/10/08	HIS TEST ARE RETARDED HARD he doesn't prepare you for them, and expect you to spend tons of time out of class just practicing problems
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	211	1	4	4	4	732112	1/30/08	Very difficult class, but he is a great guy and helpful outside of class. The tests are very hard, but with a curve being distributed on each one (a 50% curved to a C-). Though it's very hard, it's very possible to get an A or a B with effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	101	2	2	2	1	732112	10/4/07	OMG! Not an easy class, but not everything can just be handed to you... lectures are boring, he is a very "global" teacher, jumps around a lot, and VERY hard to follow... He can be helpful if you see him during his office hours..the tests are hard... he only takes attendence for the first 2 weeks.... Not the best teacher, not the worst
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		1	4	3	2	732112	5/4/09	Difficult class. Teaches at low level, tests at high level. High curves, though. Many graphs, too much math, barely any conceptual teaching. Will go on tangents and will do easy examples, but give you hard problems for homework. His notes aren't that helpful. However he will go out of his way to work with you and is extremely well-versed in his field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	211	3	4	3	2	732112	3/26/09	hard tests, bu manageable if you do the homework. I never looked at the book and still managed to pull an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		4	5	5	2	732112	11/16/08	Prof. Burnette was EXTREMELY helpful. As long as you're willing to put in the work, he's more than willing to work around your schedule to meet with you. Working with him one on one is what prepared me for the tests. The class is challenging, but not hard. You just have to do all of the practice questions he suggests before each test!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	101	2	5	4	3	732112	10/23/08	Most helpful professor I've ever had. Cares about his teaching and his students if you put in the effort. The class is hard but he does more than you could ask for to help. It's rating the professor not the class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	101	3	5	4	1	732112	10/20/08	I would bet money that the people ****ing about how hard this course is either didn't pay attention in class, didn't do the required work, or suck at algebra. It's a challenging class but if you're an RIT student you might want to learn how to deal with that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	402	1	4	3	3	732112	5/8/08	Some of you guys need to stop whining... the class is difficult and the tests are real hard but he gives away so many free pints for them via curves...he's willing to help during office hours and overall is a really great guy. Stop complaining and start studying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics	402	1	4	3	2	732112	4/19/08	Burnette is the kind of guy you wanna hang out with. He's not really the guy you want teaching your class. His tests are absolutely ridiculous, but so is the curve, at times. He's a big Mets fan, so he's got that going for him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics	211	1	3	2	3	732112	2/19/08	Burnette is a great guy, but the class is excruciatingly difficult to the point where the class average for a test was a 49%. But the curve is huge. The class is also very boring and sometimes you can't wait for class to be over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics	211	2	2	2	1	732112	11/11/07	Likes to go off on tangents during class for a good 20 minutes or so. Notes are very broken hard to read his writing and he likes to stand right in front of the notes. You are not prepared very well for his test because you are not given anything like the questions that are asked. But yet is always available to talk, even though it doesn't help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	1	1	1	732112	11/28/06	Teerrrible terrible teacher...DO NOT TAKE HIM...he doesnt explain a single thing. If you ask him a question he says its wrong, proves its right but says oh no its wrong...dont do it to yourself guys...just don't...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		3	5	4	4	732112	10/28/06	He is a great guy, who is there to help any and all of his students. This class is by no means an easy A, but with some drive its very possible and you can learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		4	4	5	5	732112	2/9/06	The class is easy. He explains things pretty well. If you pay attention to his lectures, it isn't hard to do decently on the tests. Burnette is an easy-going guy, and generally a good person. He doesn't take attendance either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	1	Economics		1	5	1	1	732112	12/13/05	THIS IS THE HARDEST CLASS EVER!the curve is ridiculous though. a 24% in our class curved up to a low D.This class is so hard,but he never takes attendence and is actually a really cool guy. If you go to his office hours and try, you will pass his class, just show him your trying. And his name is Jeffery, not Jeremey.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	2	Economics		3	4	3	3	732112	8/11/06	He says in the beginning of the course that he has a set number of A's and B's which he gives out. Some people may find this a bit unfair. His tests are moderately difficult but he does curve them. If you did well and understood economics in high school then this course shouldn't be too difficult, provided you put a little effort in.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	2	2	1	732112	2/3/06	Dropped this class after 6 weeks, it was too much, no way to get even a B, not worth it for an elective
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jefferey Burnette	3.1	0	Economics		1	1	1	1	732112	12/1/05	very hard... but a big curve
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Burress	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	3	1618025	10/24/11	Jill is amazing. She is young, cool, and really cares about you as an individual. You want to go to her class because it is so much fun. She is an awesome teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Burress	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	4	1618025	10/1/11	Jill is an amazing teacher and really cares about her students. She's easy going and teaching methods are clear. She's always available for extra help if you need and never makes you feel stupid. Definitely take her cause she's awesome! ^_^
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	609779	9/11/12	Had Eileen for 2-D Design... awesome teacher and cares about you understanding the material. Learned a lot from this lady!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	3	609779	9/11/07	She is a great person, but a tough teacher. She is tough only because she cares how well you do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	609779	2/3/06	I absolutely loved 2D design. Eileen was one of those teachers who just makes the class awesome. She works great with students who have disabilities. I found her easy to follow and to work with. It's not easy, you will have to work your butt off, but my experience in that class makes me wish I could take 2D all over again, just to have her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	3	609779	7/7/05	Eileen was a good professor, I would reccomend taking her class. She understands that college students have issues and is willing to work with you. Her assignments can be a little vague sometimes, but she will clarify further if someone enquires. She is great at answering questions about foundations stuff, go to her for help, she's great!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	609779	6/30/10	This woman is God! She's awesome! She's chill, crystal clear, compassionate, understanding, challenging, patient, and very professional. She presents material in a way that relates it to modern art world so ur perspective grows. Totally bad ass. Take her- best 2D teacher in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Buschnell	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	609779	4/30/06	a very intellegent person who is fun to talk to no matter what the subject. out of all my foundation courses, i learned the most from Eileen. BUT, Photo kids have been known to disagree with how important i think her material is.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	482	3	3	4	4	846643	12/13/12	Alright alright alright. Dr. Brown is the way to go for Circuits II at 8 am. Explains concepts really clearly and goes over examples. Tried weekly mini-exams for my class. Watch out for curveballs but just be sure to read read read the material for academic edification and provide him feedback with questions, comments, observations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		3	2	5	3	846643	11/15/11	Hands down one of the best EE professors in the department. He is relatively challenging on exams because he throws a lot of curveballs that you don't expect. Work hard, do homework questions and seriously study with your friend if you wanna do well in his class. He provides ample amount of examples so read them often
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	381	3	3	5	5	846643	5/15/10	AWESOME professor! Explains material clearly. Fair grader on tests, which are fair game. Show up to class, do all the homework and you shouldn't do too badly (unless the homework graders are extremely strict). Recommend for anybody taking Circuits. Think of Dave Chapelle with a Ph.D. and one crooked eye.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	1	Electrical Engineering		4	2	3	4	846643	12/19/09	While he's pretty thorough in his lectures he's extremely unhelpful with any questions and throws curveball tests that are much harder than any homework or lesson problems. It's as if he repeats things he read online to the class and doesn't understand them himself. I don't recommend this professor - he's misleading and a harsh grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	4	846643	5/11/06	He explains things directly out of the book but is clear and concise. He's willing to have fun but still moves through the material. He's a great guy who cares about his students and takes an active interest in them. His tests consist of 3 questions, he grades fairly though and homework is graded.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	382	3	5	5	5	846643	5/24/12	His notes and lectures are very clear and to the point. Easy to follow. Great at answering questions and making class interactive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		3	3	5	1	846643	5/3/11	Had him for Circuits I. He is an excellent professor who provides lots of example. Very entertaining guy and he tends to throw curveballs on exams. Just read, read and read and keep reading so you fully understand the material! Recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	381	3	3	5	5	846643	5/15/10	AWESOME professor! Explains material clearly. Fair grader on tests, which are fair game. Show up to class, do all the homework and you shouldn't do too badly (unless the homework graders are extremely strict). Recommend for anybody taking Circuits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Brown	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	5	846643	11/10/07	Great guy whos willing to teach and have fun while doing it. Youll learn the material with him. Got a good grade even though most of the class (most were ME) had lower grades. He makes sure you understand the material in class by asking everybody some question. Grades fairly. I would recommend this professor to anyone who wnts to lrn n good grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Brown	1.5	0	Political Science		2	1	3	2	573921	4/26/06	impossible to follow his unorganized, long, and boring lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Brown	1.5	0	Political Science		2	1	3	1	573921	8/31/05	Extremely boring professor, all he does is essentially talk about the assigned reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Brown	1.5	0	Political Science		2	1	1	5	573921	9/7/05	He shows up to class late EVERY TIME. His lessons are all about the 60-70's era. Also, no way to know what is going to be on the test -- a lot of times it was on material never discussed in class. He has limited office hours, and I didn't get much clarity when I did seek help. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Brown	1.5	0	Political Science		3	1	1	1	573921	2/25/05	Ridiculous teacher. The ONLY reason to take his class is if you already know A LOT about the class and don't need it to be retaught. Otherwise, keep a very far distance away from Brown. Comes to every class late, didn't even show up to one of the clases. Be careful if you choose to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		4	2	2	1	214049	3/4/13	Definitely not the best professor, but also not the worst. She is very boring and makes students pretty much teach each other the class, instead of teaching herself. She is a nice lady, but bad professor. The class overall was not extremely difficult as long as you followed directions. There was limited mandatory work outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science	211	2	1	2	1	214049	4/21/10	Don't ever take her class. She's incredibly egotistic and accepts no views other than her own. If you are not willing to agree with her on everything, you won't get an A. She also gave me an attitude when I came to class sick to hand in a paper, so she doesn't seem to understand that sometimes people can't be in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		2	1	3	1	214049	2/17/10	I haven't been here for long but she is by far the worst teacher OR professor I've ever had. Boring, loves being right, unusual class structure, and not to mention the class kinda sucks. Don't take, avoid, or drop. It's worth it I wish I did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science	200	2	1	1	2	214049	11/20/09	terrible... all these comments, plus some more... AVOID AT ALL COSTS! just too confusing... her class teaching methods are not what I would expect from an easy class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		1	1	1	2	214049	10/9/09	Drop ASAP. I swear it will be the best decision of your life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	2	Political Science	555	4	5	4	3	214049	2/28/08	Very nice person, provoked good discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	2	Political Science		5	4	4	5	214049	10/5/05	loved this teacher, she made me very interested and encouraged people to speak their minds not matter the topic
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		1	1	2	1	214049	4/27/05	Tests are horrable, for the final test she allowed us to work in groups because the entire class had at least a D average. Passed the class with a C, but she is a horrable teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		1	1	1	1	214049	1/31/05	worst teacher i've had in my entire life. if you are signed up with her---drop the class. seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		2	1	1	NULL	214049	5/3/04	This is horrible she makes the students lead the class for the first hour and then she teaches the second hour and by then the majority of the students are confused on what the topic is exactly. Tests are brutal too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		1	1	1	4	214049	10/6/10	She is the worst teacher ever!!!I failed this class because of the plagiarism,when I was just describing facts for the discussion leading. Argh
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	1	Political Science	211	2	2	3	4	214049	2/26/10	Course is very boring. First hour of every class is wasted with student presentations, followed by an hour of ranting against technology. Textbooks are hundreds of pages that say absolutely nothing of value. Unfair grading of papers. Attendance enforced by five pop quizzes. Course caused lots of stress and sleep loss. Verdict: Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science	211	1	1	2	3	214049	2/3/10	terrible teacher, all of these comments are 100% true. I would never take one of her classes again. She grades very hard and expects students to do much of the teacher by presentations
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science	305	2	1	3	4	214049	10/27/09	Teacher has an ego problem, picks favorites in the class, has very few grades that are weighted dramatically. Avoid this teacher. She loves telling students that they are wrong, even if what you said was true. The topic is interesting, but the professor ruins it. If you were placed in this class, drop it before it is too late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	1	Political Science		2	3	3	3	214049	3/2/09	She has boring lectures that about the reading but she doesn't give exams so they are pointless to listen too. She grades papers harder than any English teacher I have ever had. She focuses to much on unimportant things rather than the overall paper. I do not recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		2	2	2	1	214049	2/14/07	Very Very Very boring. Reading selections were ever more even more boring. Expects too much from what should be an easy lib arts course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		3	2	1	1	214049	7/30/05	Horrible teacher. Her lectures were incredibly dull and uninteresting. Her reading material choices were also incredibly terrble and her tests were long and tedious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		1	1	1	1	214049	4/12/05	This teacher is very unclear as to what she expects from you and you are expected to teach the course. How can you do that when you don't know what she is looking for?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		2	2	2	NULL	214049	5/5/04	I couldnt have said it any better. Plus every absense of class is 1 letter grade off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Brown	1.9	0	Political Science		2	2	2	NULL	214049	5/20/03	Very difficult for a 200 level course. Stay away from this teacher at all costs. Multiple Choice portion of tests are brutal.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	2	Languages	305	5	4	4	5	910810	12/22/08	He's a nice teacher, he'll help you anytime if you ask for help. One important thing is you need to be on time for the class for the pop quiz and test. i was late one time and i missed a pop quiz and not able to make up. And i suggest you to remind him if you email you work and didn't get a grade. however,i enjoy his class9/10of the time.Fun class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	0	Languages		3	2	2	5	910810	5/17/07	I hate this teacher. He's extremely disorganized and came to class unprepared. He lost one of my test tapes and then proceeded to blame that on me, and also told me I couldn't take the test over. Thank god he found it that weekend. I'm not the only one he's lost tapes of.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	2	Languages		5	3	4	5	910810	1/28/07	I disagree with everyone - I think he is an AWESOME teacher. You may not have understood him but he was always clear to my classes. True, he never responded to e-mails but I would love to continue on with him if he taught the higher classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	0	Languages		2	1	1	5	910810	11/12/06	He's terrible at feedback! Even after we told him that we needed more he still didn't do a good job of telling us what we were doing wrong! He comes to class unprepared, takes forever to grade things and doesn't even know how to sign things in the book before he comes to class. I hope I never take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	0	Languages		3	2	1	5	910810	11/4/06	He's not the best at feed back so you're never really sure what you're signing wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	2	Languages		3	4	4	5	910810	12/2/07	Can be extremely helpful if you only take the time to raise your hand and ask him a question. He will do his best to answer your questions fully, and if you show up and participate, you will probably be fine. Due dates for assignments can sometimes be unclear, just keep asking him about it until he tells you the actual date it will be due.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	2	Languages		4	4	4	5	910810	2/12/07	I disagree with most of these ratings. I really like Ritchie as a teacher, although he does pick on certain people. If he knows you're shy, he'll make you do things in front of the class more often. won't give up on explaining something to a student. PS: it's your responsibility to read the syllabus, we're in college for crying out loud!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	0	Languages	101	3	1	1	5	910810	12/14/06	He is TERRIBLE at getting back to you!! Does not respond to emails and does not explain A THING!!If you don't read the syllabus you will not know what is due. I wouldn't have even know we had to do a paper if I didn't read the syllabus!! He did not mention it once or collect it, you had to go to him!! Would never take a calss with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ritchie Bryant	2.6	0	Languages		2	2	2	5	910810	11/10/06	Well I hated how he always picked on me : ( I know im being a baby about it. The one thing i liked about him was the fact that he helped me make the decision to switch my major...meh
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Buck	1.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	5	1241687	12/19/10	While he is somewhat knowledgeable, he is easily agitated and easily offended making it difficult to have a good learning experience. Secondly, he is there so infrequently it makes it difficult to follow up with questions and advice. While being a full time faculty he is there barely part time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Buff	5.0	2	Physical Ed	100	2	5	5	5	800598	5/1/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Buff	5.0	2	Physical Ed		5	5	5	4	800598	1/18/06	She is the best teacher, she lets us work out for class, while still trying to keep a lesson somewhere in there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	2	Biology		3	3	5	4	478464	4/23/08	She's very excited about what she teaches, but her tests can be very hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology	101	1	2	2	3	478464	4/25/07	The professor is one of the most difficult professors I have ever had. She was pregnant when I took her so she was very distracted so I don't know if she's like this now but it was confusing and hard. Her tests are ridiculously difficult and aren't related to her Power Point presentations! READ READ
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology	201	1	1	1	3	478464	11/9/06	she's nice but over-complicates her lectures. her tests are difficult because she tries to trick you. she talks to you like kindergarteners and then tests like you're graduate students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	2	478464	11/12/05	tests are tricky, her office hours are terrible, not very helpful...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		3	2	2	4	478464	10/5/05	my friend colleen wanted to go to lecture with a cross screaming at her: "the power of Christ compells you!" over and over again... this woman is something to overcome for sure
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	1	Biology		4	2	3	5	478464	4/11/05	Exam questions are challenging, but study and understand the material and you'll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	478464	2/3/05	Bad Prof. All you do in class is look at a power pont prst. Very boring. Test are very hard, question aim to trick you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	2	4	478464	1/28/05	not a good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	2	2	5	478464	11/19/04	WOW a D!!! i never had a D before in my life! all i have to say is if u want to learn it then read the book, she goes way to fast on the powerpoint slides and they are sometimes confusing...however if u get to know her she can be a cool person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology	101	1	2	2	1	478464	9/12/07	One word... Clicker. I hated that thing. Mine would never work and when I tried to talk to her she said too bad and punished me for it. Her tests are absurd, just a bunch of trick questions that would confuse even the obsessive studiers. Some were even on what she was wearing on a certain day, how am I supposed to remember that? Crap teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	2	Biology	201	2	2	5	5	478464	3/11/07	i loved dr jones. she had a real gift for making everything clear in lecture, and can be really hilarious. Sometimes class was like a stand up comic show. she has high expectations for us but she always had fair policies. if you didn't learn in her class it was your own fault.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	2	Biology		3	4	5	4	478464	12/7/05	Good teacher - explains concepts very well, willing to help after lecture if you need help. Tests aren't bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	3	478464	11/11/05	By far the worst prof I've had at RIT, very unclear, difficult tests and does not care about her students. I've had several issues with her: won't hand back tests, goes through notes too fast, and not helpful when seek it out. Expect to learn it all on your own because she won't help you. Many of her policies are moronic and convoluted. Avoid her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	3	1	3	478464	5/15/05	Her lectures were good, but her tests were tricky. The questions were usually unclear and tricky. They were aimed to trick you. Even my TA said one of her questions on her practical was worded very very badly and made no sense. He then asked if her questions weer like that on teh test. My Answer..."worse"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	2	Biology		4	5	4	3	478464	3/21/05	I don't know what everybody else is complaining about. The power points made it so you never had to go to class. All you had to do was study the power points and you could easily get a good grade. I never had to open the textbook once in 3 quarters.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	5	478464	2/1/05	very confusing explanations, horrible teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	478464	11/29/04	exam questions are impossible - studied for 18 hours and ended up with a C for thefinal
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Burdett	2.1	0	Biology		1	1	1	4	478464	10/25/04	Terrible teacher, do not take this class!! All i have to say are...power point slides!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	2	Mathematics	101	5	5	5	5	67395	4/14/08	excellent
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	67395	10/25/04	Great teacher whould will help you out of class if neeeded. Knows how to get students through proofs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	NULL	67395	4/27/04	Pretty decent discrete teacher. Homework is hard, tests are easy. Her lectures are about half and half, as far as usefulness goes. She is sometimes very clear and explains very well, other times, too many definitions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	NULL	67395	3/26/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	1	67395	8/12/05	One of the worst professors I've ever had. Not only did I frequently come to her office for help because I didn't understand what she was trying to teach, but her condescending attitude in her office as well as in class didn't do much for the learning environment for many students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamara Burton	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67395	5/21/04	Very good professor. She is very clear and encourages many questions inside and outside of class. Homework is really hard and makes you think, but her tests are directly related to class notes. One of the best math professors I've ever had!

Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	2	Chemistry		3	4	3	2	1343642	10/29/12	Had him for college chem. moves through power points very quickly, often stumbles and says wrong information. Definitely not the smartest teacher, but will answer any question you have and is always available for help. Tests aren't that many questions so if you get a few wrong it will effect your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	2	Chemistry	208	3	4	3	3	1343642	11/10/11	Butler will go through the power point presentations fast. He does post most of the lectures online if you don't get them. You should go to class because the clicker questions are similar to questions on test (all test online except final). Butler also looks to help his students you have to go talk with him yourself or go to review sessions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	2	Chemistry	208	4	5	4	4	1343642	10/16/11	Mr. Butler is a really good guy. Not the best teacher I've ever had but when I struggled, he definitely helped me out. If you want to do better he can help you out a lot. You can tell that he's very passionate about Chemistry and that he wants students to succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	0	Chemistry	208	5	2	2	1	1343642	11/9/09	Butler is a nice guy but a pretty useless professor. He goes on rants and expects you to get the material. His homework is annoying, his quizzes are annoying and his class was just a nuisance altogether.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	2	Chemistry		4	4	3	1	1343642	12/1/11	Definitely not one of my favorite teachers, though I also rather hate chemistry. Made frequent mistakes and went fast so he was hard to follow at times. Otherwise, was approachable and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	1	Chemistry	208	4	4	2	2	1343642	11/1/11	Mr. Butler was very disorganized often and flies through his slides during class. I learned more from homework and recitation than lecture. Good guy but I would stay away if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	1	Chemistry	208	3	2	3	2	1343642	2/4/10	Professor Butler was a good teacher. He certainly knows his stuff when it comes to chemistry. However, he was often unorganized coming to class and would not always answer the questions asked in class because of limited time. I've heard other chem. teachers are better at RIT so try getting someone else before you take Butler.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Butler	2.9	0	Chemistry	208	2	1	1	2	1343642	11/3/09	Butler is a nice guy but not a good professor. He loves the Beatles and he asks questions about them everyday. He often messes up in his powerpoint's and says "oops. i'm sorry."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	0	Design		4	1	1	3	245462	2/2/12	Not very helpful, I wouldn't recommend taking his class. His demos move fast and he doesn't explain much at all. What you learn, you will teach yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	0	Design		3	2	2	4	245462	11/16/11	An okay professor. Didn't really teach us anything in the class, and feedback was kind of ambiguous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	2	Design		4	5	5	4	245462	9/26/05	Goes out of his way to help students, pushes students in a productive way to gain more knowledge, personality helps makes learning experience enjoyable through contructive criticism rather than demeaning, overall worthwhile
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	2	Design		2	5	5	5	245462	3/31/05	Peter just plain rocks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	0	Design		3	2	1	4	245462	11/21/11	Okay professor. Does no demos, as most professors do. He also isn't very clear on what he wants done for projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	2	Design		4	5	5	4	245462	3/26/11	He is nice and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	2	Design		4	5	5	5	245462	4/4/05	Great professor, very helpful, clear, and worth working with
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Byrne	3.6	2	Design		4	5	4	NULL	245462	9/4/03	Peter is one of the most patient professors I had through my four years at RIT. He takes the time to make sure you learn what you want to (put the time in) to learn. He is also a big help when it comes to post-RIT information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	4	1568323	11/26/12	Dont take this class! Homework is easy, but his tests are much harder than the homework to the point that its unfair. He is also a very picky grader. I have always been a great math student, but not in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics	331	4	5	4	5	1568323	5/17/12	Had for linear 1&2. Weekly quizzes test understanding. Good lectures, but lot of material (prepare to review your notes). Decent amount of homework, teached you to solve it with MATLAB. Exams are tough but fair; if you actually did the homework and review the quizzes, you'll be fine. Very friendly, energetic, and helpful with questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics	331	3	5	4	5	1568323	11/10/11	Awesome professor. Teaches very clearly, always explains himself, and answers questions well. Doesn't always understand questions well the first time, but it hits him soon! Homework and quizzes are fair. Likes to relate math to "real world" problems (ACTUAL real world, not "how far does a banana go if I throw it"-type fake-real-world problems).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1568323	10/23/11	I have had Professor Cahill for Multivariable and Linear Algebra. He teaches clearly and the homework is doable (questions from text book). Assignments are due Thurs. and there is a quiz on the HW that day. The homework is not excessive, but takes a few hours. I would highly recommend Professor Cahill; I enjoyed both of his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	2	1568323	4/25/11	He does not help much at all. The weekly quizzes have only 2 questions. His tests are really hard and have a lot of tricks in them . However, his curve at the end of the class helps matters but if you can avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1568323	11/13/12	Great professor, great sense of humor. Everything you need to know he teaches in lecture, but the homework problems come straight from the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	0	Mathematics	432	1	2	1	2	1568323	3/3/12	I took Linear Algebra 2 with him. he is not a good professor. He never explain clearly....to much home work. Homework problem are sometime not related to the material. Don't wast your time to take his class. I am really good student in math. I got A in Linear one...but lenear 2?????
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	4	3	1568323	10/26/11	Nice guy tries to prove all the material with you and then goes through examples. Not an easy class but he will help if you ask. 1 weekly hw 1 weekly quiz 2 tests, tests took some thought but overall ok. Best COS professor ive had but that isnt saying much
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Cahill	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	1568323	5/27/11	He does his best to lecture clearly. He is passionate in teaching students Calculus. However, he will not give you answers so easily. 1 weekly HW, 1 weekly quiz, 3 exams and 1 final. He is not that strict on grading but the assignments are time-consuming, he grades by "effort." His quiz/exams are not easy, you have to know the concepts really well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph  Cala	3.5	2	Business		4	3	4	3	1798826	2/21/13	Really easy grader. If you do your work, you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cara Calvelli	4.0	2	Physician Assistant Studies	101	1	5	4	4	1065940	2/24/11	Great teacher, really cares about the students. Definitely demanding, but it's because she wants us to be competent. Thanks, Cara.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cara Calvelli	4.0	2	Physician Assistant Studies		2	5	4	5	1065940	10/14/10	Dr. Calvelli is a very good educator. The material is not easy. It is physician level science but she has a way of making it come alive. She works very hard to deliver the best education so that we will be great PAs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cara Calvelli	4.0	2	Physician Assistant Studies		3	5	5	5	1065940	10/26/10	Dr. Calvelli is a very nice person. She is very interested in our success. She is very demanding but in a nice way. Her efforts will make the PA profession that much better. Thank you Dr. Calvelli!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cara Calvelli	4.0	0	Physician Assistant Studies		1	2	2	2	1065940	12/3/07	The worse class that I've ever taken!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	265696	4/25/12	All in all a pretty good course. Interesting and fun mostly. But a lot of writing (daily). I would take her for ProfComm over any others. She helps a lot to get you ready for coop.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	1	Computer Science	455	2	4	2	5	265696	3/5/12	Lectures directly from slides, which are provided online anyway. She gives homework, but doesn't collect it (instead gives the solutions) and it isn't a part of your grade, providing no incentive to do it. Exams are awful, as they almost never match the homework problems or examples in lecture slides. Overall, a hard course taught rather poorly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	4	5	265696	12/12/11	Overall she's okay better than most cs professors. Textbook is only used as a reference you don't really need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	265696	8/24/11	She is a great professor - very nice and willing to help. Helped me get coop job and gave lots of feedback on resume. Sometimes late letting us out so keep her on track. Overall, highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	0	Computer Science	455	2	2	2	4	265696	10/25/10	Creates 4 question tests and says they aren't meant to test your knowledge of the material. Projects involve more trying to figure out how to exactly fit her specifications than doing anything useful. Stated in class that your grade doesn't matter and you shouldn't worry about it, then grades harshly. Will not listen to reason or contrary argument.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	5	265696	1/21/09	Overall, very good teacher. Gives a clear idea of the material, very fair, homework is reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	265696	11/30/08	Good teacher in lecture, I'm against her philosophy that "a lower grade will build character" - which was her response to a low 70 being the average of the first test. Though when it was all said and done and the dust settled, I had a B - if you just show up, listen in lecture, do the projects and lab, this class is cake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	5	4	265696	2/28/07	very fair grader. I like her a lot. and have taken several classes with her... recommended. A+++ fast shipping.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	5	265696	2/13/06	Good teacher. She can sometimes get lost in teaching the overly redundant basics (it's hard to do, so props there!). I would take her for the entire CS sequence if I could, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	1	Computer Science		4	3	2	5	265696	11/14/05	Had her for CS1, she often beats a topic to death. Tests arent bad but prepare to have a nice nap most days.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science	455	3	5	5	5	265696	3/31/12	Great course learned a lot and fun too. Exams were hard but ok if you go to class and don't sleep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	265696	1/5/12	I love her. I wish all my professors were like her. Helpful, nice and very good with the material which was not so easy to learn. Take if you can get.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science	241	3	3	4	3	265696	11/3/11	This professor is fairly good for teaching the material, which in my opinion is alot squeezed into one class. However, this style of teaching is the same throughout RIT. Also, the professor herself does not grade the homework; they are passed down to Teaching Assistants.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	0	Computer Science	341	5	2	2	1	265696	7/7/11	I don't know anything about her other classes. I assume she is competent there. But she is an absolute joke for Prof Comm. Show up to class, raise your hand to say something inane once per class, and do her little diary entries and you will be all right. Some presentations and a resume project, but they're easy to ace. Made fun of her all quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	3	5	3	265696	12/3/09	She's a great teacher. Very strict about following directions on the homework but the work isn't hard. She tries to make the classes fun with discussion. Easy A if you do the work the way she specifies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	265696	11/30/08	Very easy - writes the EXACT CODE (not the psuedo code) on the board, it's basically just copy/paste what's there. You don't exactly learn a lot in lab but that's a different ball of wax. Just copy what she has on the board and you got a 100% on the lab - easy easy. Take if you can get!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	265696	12/12/07	Very NICE lady. She is very lenient when it comes to grading which shows she cares and is not out to destroy you. She was always really helpful when I asked questions through email or in person. She also went through a bunch of examples on the board which helps.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	265696	3/15/06	Good teacher. Beats a topic to death for sure. Makes sure to have all information retained. Helpful on projects. Grades fairly on projects. Decently easy tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	4	265696	12/6/05	Easy class, good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	265696	10/17/05	She taught ever well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	1	265696	10/25/04	I am a Stat major who had to take this, so she did a good job all things considered. I just stink at this stuff, but I got a B because of her good teaching. Nice person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	1	Computer Science	231	4	3	3	NULL	265696	11/11/03	she tries to explain a topic to the point where it hurts to think about it. It's difficult to follow through her lectures, they are too wordy and abstract. MAny classes spent asleep
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	1	Computer Science		4	2	3	NULL	265696	10/29/03	Had her for my cs 1 lab.. she gives a decent lecture about how to do the different labs, but after that.. its difficult to get help from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	265696	10/25/04	Of all the teachers I've had for CS 1-4, Canosa is the only one who actually _explains_ what's going on and goes through a step-by-step process on the board instead of handing you code to search through. I'd take her for every cs course if I could.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Roxanne Canosa	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	NULL	265696	10/22/03	It's a pain to learn Java without a computer in front of you to practice on. Class was my daily nap.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paloma Capanna	5.0	2	Political Science	513	5	5	5	3	1692158	2/6/12	Wonderful teacher and very interesting and smart. She loves politics and can make you love it too. I highly recommend her for American Politics, even if you don't like Politics!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cappon	4.9	2	Science	211	5	5	5	5	67481	2/22/10	Amazing class, all discussion based and lasts 1 out of the 4 hours. Easiest class you will ever take! 6th grader could get a 100
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cappon	4.9	2	Science		5	5	5	NULL	67481	2/2/04	He is the easiest teacher you will find! You dont even have to read for his class, because the class is a lecture based on your opinions! Take his class!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cappon	4.9	2	Science		5	5	5	3	67481	2/21/06	Very easy class, very little reading and extremely easy class discussions! Take this class..

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Caputi	3.8	2	History	301	5	4	4	3	513073	10/18/06	I had him for American History. As mentioned already he would hand out a sheet of 40? terms (people, places or events) and 16 of them would be on the test. You just had to write a paragraph about each, showing you knew something about them. Overall the class wasn't too hard, he's a nice guy, although he will go off on tangents.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Caputi	3.8	2	History		4	4	3	3	513073	11/28/04	Dr. Caputi was quite an easy professor. He gave out a list of the items that would be on each test a week before the 2 tests, and there was one paper on war, 5 pages. He does get sidetracked about things a lot. You don't really need to pay attention, and you can use wikipedia rather than buy book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	4	3	3	373414	4/11/13	A mentor! If you listen carefully you will learn from Owen. If you close your mind you will not. Owen has helped make me the photographer and teacher that I am Today.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	373414	4/12/12	Owen is a wonderful professor. Tough but fair. I am still using what he taught me in Photography in my daily life. He was my mentor in the Photography program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	2	4	373414	11/17/11	this class was my favorite. if youre one who needs crits and time to "talk" about your work, dont bother taking butler. he has a lot of lessons to teach you, which will apply to ny area of photo. the class wasnt extremely PJ which i liked because we had freedom
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts		3	4	2	5	373414	11/9/11	Butler..... well, he's really unclear about things, but you will enjoy this class. Listen to what he says, he's been around the block enough times. He's hilarious, but probably shouldn't be teaching here anymore. I'm really glad I took his class, but he doesn't do much teaching. Our assignments were last minute and we never had a crit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts	456	2	5	1	5	373414	8/14/10	Owen is amazing, you can't leave RIT without taking 1 class with him. In my class we shot like 10 photographs in a whole quarter, while other pj sections shot 10/hour. He will help you see things in new and different ways. I highly recommend him and got a lot of great information and knowledge out of taking his class. don't expect an easy class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	4	3	4	373414	1/27/09	Butler is a great teacher if you let yourself learn. many of the comments on here against him are from photographers who believe that their intitled to having a professor tell them their awsome and all this bs. he doesn't coddle you, and is concerned with you learning, albiet in an unorthodox way. i will admit his criques are lacking good feedback
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	373414	5/12/08	Heres the deal with Owen he will not hesitate to tell you what he feels about your work if he tells you to switch majors its probably a good idea to do it cause he is just trying to help,,most people don't realize that he is trying to help you and his attacks are not personal you have to mature enough to handle his class...if not go home
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	4	373414	7/14/07	AWFUL- worst experience of my entire life. Plays favorites- and he hated every single thing I did. Told me I had no place at RIT and had no talent, and that he was trying to get me to leave- well at least he accomplished that much cause I do not go to school there anymore! He is brutal and loves personal attacks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	5	373414	10/24/05	Owen is amazing! He is a little to understand, and sometimes his projects can be confusing, but you can learn a lot from him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	373414	4/12/12	Owen was a wonderful professor and teaching mentor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts	101	2	3	5	5	373414	1/9/12	owen knows what hes talking about, hes soft spoken but will tell you like it is everytime. hes extremely knowledgeable and knows all the ins and outs of PJ.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	5	373414	11/12/11	Butler is the man. He's extremely smart and knows the business inside and out. Listen to what he has to say and just enjoy the stories he tells. He's unclear about assignments and you don't have 'real' crits but his knowledge about life far out weighs some of the other things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	373414	8/26/11	Don't bother being stupid and stubborn. Listen to him, he's awesome. I was changing my major, he told me not to. He knows his stuff, thinks before each word is spoken. He told us to get ipads, theyr the next best thing in our career paths. I asked him if he got one, he said, "I got TWO."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts		2	4	2	5	373414	4/15/09	Photographically, Owen is a man who has seen pretty much everything over the years. Hang on his every word. He is perceptive on an alarming level. Show him your photographs, and he'll tell you things about yourself you never knew. By all means, take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts		4	3	2	5	373414	1/27/09	Do not bother taking Owen Butler if you are ad photo. You will not understand him and his teaching methods. However, any photojournalism or fine art student i've known who has taken him has nothing but good things to say. Owen teaches you what a good photograph is, and does not coddle freshmen like other teaches allowing one to take better photos.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts	500	2	5	5	5	373414	10/20/07	The best professor I have ever had. A wonderful mentor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	1	Fine Arts		3	3	3	5	373414	1/31/07	difficult to understand at first because his method of teaching is so different from other photo teachers. he lets you do your own thing for the most part. butler is awesome though, i've learned more from 2 quarters (going on a third) with him that with any other teacher.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	5	373414	8/30/05	BURTLER! He's more conceptual. Don't listen to what other students say. You learn in his class it's just alot different than how you learn in your other classes. It's alot more DIY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	373414	6/15/04	Awesome guy, Is a real inspiration
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	373414	10/24/04	Really inspirational guy. Very funny and not uptight at all. If you like to have a lot of structure he isn't the right teacher for you. Definitely one of the best teachers I've had at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Owen Butler	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	373414	3/29/04	Owen ROCKS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science	242	3	5	5	5	480160	2/13/13	Professor Butler was an awesome professor for CS2. He kept lectures interesting, answered questions well, and was super helpful whenever I went to his office hours. If you get the chance to take him, definitely do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science	243	4	3	4	5	480160	11/11/12	Very interesting and engaging professor. Explains Java very well, including the concepts behind it, the reasons for some of its oddities, and how students can use it effectively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	3	4	5	480160	11/28/11	His lectures are helpful, especially for a class like CS4. I did well in his class, but the gap in difficulty between the labs and project is so ridiculous its crazy. Also, he scares me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	3	480160	1/28/10	If you're taking the normal IT programming he is great but he often gets confused with C#. Quick HW and makes tests from lab examples. Better than most programming professors
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	480160	2/22/09	AMAZING professor. Made understanding C++ a peace of cake. Readily available almost every time you go to see him. Always willing to help and very informative. Humorous and great at teaching/keeping the class interesting. Highly recommended and would definitely take again if I didn't already finish CS4. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	480160	10/14/08	Best CS Professor out of the three I've had so far at RIT. He's an awesome guy, and is ALWAYS willing to help if you need it. He explains things very well, and doesn't get impatient.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	480160	10/22/07	Awesome professor, very good at communicating the concepts in class. Very flexible and informal.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	3	480160	10/25/06	very easy, keeps it fun even if you already know cs1 Goes slow enough for people who are new Tests are really easy if you know programming Get him if possible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	3	480160	10/22/06	I knew CS1 would be easy for me personally coming in, but this teacher is willing to take time to explain in detail, help students, and go over exactly what we need to know for the labs. In short: if you know Java, easy class. If not, moderately easy class. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	3	480160	10/23/05	A pretty good teacher and a great guy. He's a bit eccentric but mad funny and really nice. Manged to keep me awake at a 9am, which is pretty much amazing. The only complaint I have is that he doesn't really remind you about assignments- you'd better keep track of when things are due, or else you'll get a shocker when he mentions it the day before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	480160	11/17/12	Dr. Butler explains things well and keeps class interesting. One of the better CS professors I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	480160	3/1/12	Best CS professor for the lower levels I've had. Keeps things clear and focused, and answers questions fully. Always a good choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	1	Computer Science	243	4	3	3	3	480160	4/11/10	Overall, a better professor than most, but is really stingy on giving points out unless you have "Exactly" what he wants. He'll agree with what you said in class and then find out he took off 5 points when you get grade back.Good in explaining Java, but when you ask him a question, he makes it more difficult and walks away thinking he answered it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science	232	5	5	4	4	480160	3/26/09	Excellent Teacher, talks a little fast sometimes, but he's very helpful.Listen for the "Yay!"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science	334	3	5	5	4	480160	11/9/08	Excellent professor. He is excellent at explaining how to program in C++. If you had trouble, he could quickly clear up any issues you had in his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	480160	11/24/07	One of the best CS professors out there right now. His teachings are easy to understand and he shows a lot of examples using his laptop which is good, tests range from easy to medium level difficulty and he is a fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	480160	2/7/07	Great teacher as well as being an awesome guy. He will go out of his way to help you with a problem and is very interesting to talk to. His class is much more fun than any other lecture. Tests are few, but are moderately difficult... as long as you study a bit you'll be fine, he's a fantastic teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	5	480160	10/23/06	Nice guy, happy personality. Teaches CS1 relatively well and his quizzes (aka tests) aren't too hard provided you study. Read the chapters before quizzes and use them to reference yourself during labs. Labs can save your grade if you're doing badly as they're 30% of your GPA and are relatively easy to do well in if you get help early! Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	480160	12/21/05	Good teacher. Good examples. Keeps himself available to students. Easy to follow. A bit on the boring side at times but not terrible. Would highly recommend to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	480160	7/4/05	Butler is a great teacher, he is thorough and clear but not boring. He is fair when it comes to grading and projects, and he is great at explaining things other professors haven't been able to answer for me before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	480160	3/7/05	Really nice person, always willing to help and usually will spot errors lightning fast. (Me and 3 grad students spent ~1 hour trying to fix an error, it took him 2 minutes to find it!) Not always sure of synactical or is-it-possible-to-do-this questions. Tests fairly easy, gives insight on projects.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	480160	1/16/05	it's his first year, but he's made a good start: he's interesting to listen to, comes up with oddball examples to make a point: if( Zach.isHungry() ){ Zach.eats(); } plus, he's a really nice guy who who's available a lot and makes it very easy to contact him. and he's short
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Butler	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	3	480160	10/27/04	very clear and to the point. Easy tests, no homework. Labs are easy if you pay attention to him in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kris Byron	5.0	2	Business		2	5	5	5	508586	2/3/06	When I took her class, my days started at 3 am, and class went till 9 pm (instead of 10), and I was actually interested enough to stay awake and pay attention. She applies the concepts to real life and presents information in a way that is easy to understand and relate to. Another one of my all time favorite teachers! Definitely will have to work!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kris Byron	5.0	2	Business	300	2	5	5	2	508586	2/5/05	Very innovative style of teaching. Never get bored in her class. Various activities in every class. Tough grader but makes class interesting. Got an A and worked for it too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kris Byron	5.0	2	Business		2	5	5	4	508586	12/8/05	Awesome teacher. Very interesting topics. Applied to real life. New and fresh ideas for projects and teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		5	3	4	4	67463	10/5/05	I miss him so much! He was very easy and explained things thoroughly at a pace everyone could keep with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		2	5	4	3	67463	4/11/05	Funny and knows his stuff
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		4	5	5	1	67463	10/27/04	great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		4	5	5	5	67463	10/15/04	He signs when he talks which makes him talk a bit slower but it is great for taking notes. Plus he writes everything on the overhead. Really nice and funny
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		4	4	4	NULL	67463	5/27/04	sleepy time.. but knows his stuff
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		4	5	5	NULL	67463	10/31/03	Very clear...he signed while he talks so he goes slower.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	67463	12/12/02	definitely the best professor i've ever had, very clear and always helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science	101	3	5	5	NULL	67463	11/30/02	good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		5	5	5	3	67463	7/18/05	loved him. he is kinda boring but he makes jokes to keep everyone awake. im really sad that he retired, but glad that i had a chance to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		4	5	5	5	67463	10/27/04	he is super nice and funny. he signs and it makes sense when he explains things with examples and overheads
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		5	5	5	5	67463	10/24/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		3	5	4	NULL	67463	8/7/04	cain was the most helpful professor i've ever had. i liked the fact that he took time to learn to sign himself so that he could interact directly with his deaf and hard of hearing students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	1	Science		5	4	2	NULL	67463	2/4/04	Class is mad easy, but very boring. you can get an A and not even go
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	2	Science		3	4	4	NULL	67463	9/10/03	Very fair guy. Will help you out if you need help. Explains very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Cain	4.4	0	Science		4	2	2	NULL	67463	12/11/02	speaks slower than any man I've ever met
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhonda Callaway	4.5	2	History		2	5	5	4	588778	11/6/05	Overall an AMAZING professor. Learnt more in the two classes I took with her than in any of my other classes. Highly Highly recommended. You will have work, but none of it is even close to being busy work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhonda Callaway	4.5	2	History		3	5	5	5	588778	8/29/05	Good professor, keeps her personal opinions out of the class and doesn't try to impose a liberal pov on a young mind. Engaging professor who provokes thought and logic process.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhonda Callaway	4.5	2	History		3	5	4	4	588778	6/14/05	In my opinion, an excellent professor. Everything is presented via powerpoint and posted to mycourses. Material is pretty self explanatory; book is easy to read. explains everything clearly and always offering extra credit opportunities. her only fault is that sometimes she can be slow returning grades/posting them to mycourses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhonda Callaway	4.5	2	History		2	5	4	4	588778	8/31/05	She was very hard but very fair, and very helpful. I got the wrong book at the beginning of the quarter (wrong ver.) and Had an F, but with her help got up to a B in only a few weeks. Do not be disruptive in her class. Dont do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhonda Callaway	4.5	2	History		4	3	4	4	588778	8/24/05	Very effective professor. Engaging enough to get you through the class, but not so crazy that she distracts from the subject. Other people had trouble with the class, but if you retain a decent ammount of the material, you will do great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kari Cameron	3.7	2	Communication	480	5	4	5	3	1655292	11/9/12	Extremely nice and very flexible with handing in assignments and what not. I was in the miserable time slot of the 6-10pm class but we usually got out around 8 or 9pm. She REALLY put an effort into making the class enjoyable, and could tell when we were getting bored, so she would change her outline to make it less-boring :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kari Cameron	3.7	2	Communication	481	4	4	4	3	1655292	11/30/11	She is by far one of the nicest professors I have had at RIT. I had her for human communications and persuasion. She wasn't able to make class one day because of traffic, so she brought all of her students in donuts the next class. The class was very simple and it is easy to get an A. I recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kari Cameron	3.7	1	Communication	101	5	2	3	2	1655292	11/7/12	Had her for Persuasion and got an A. Very easy class if you attend all classes and do the work. Didn't really learn too much, but it was an Easy A class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jamie Campbell	4.5	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	604092	8/1/05	Great teacher, wondeful person. Intreresting. Funny. Makes you think! Couldn't ask for a better teacher! The BEST!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jamie Campbell	4.5	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	5	604092	4/24/05	Even though he is retired, he came to teach at least one more class at RIT and I was lucky enough to have him. He's perhaps one of if not the best teacher I've ever had b/c he makes the subjects so interesting. If you see his name in the course registration booklit, take the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiaojun Cao	4.5	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	3	729680	10/18/05	Hard to understand at first, but is a great teacher who will stay extra long in lab to help students. Fair grader also.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing		4	5	5	2	1173944	2/23/12	Really cool guy. Took a superhero class with him. Went in not very interested but he made it interesting and opened my eyes to aspects of media I wouldn't usually notice. Very fun and lively guy! Yes there are essays and papers, but its a writing class. I definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing	319	4	4	5	2	1173944	11/18/11	You have to write essays of course but its so easy. If you come to class and pay attention, you're bound to get an A. Also, for like half the quarter you watch movies.... another fourth of the quarter you do presentations. rarely do you read in the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing		5	5	4	3	1173944	10/23/10	Before I took this clas, i thought wriing seminar would be a torture. But, Mr.C made this class really enjoyable and fun, totally would take him again if had the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing	101	2	5	5	2	1173944	8/24/09	Loved Professor Cap! I took three of his classes bc he was so great! He was one of the most engaging professors i have ever had. Very understanding and relates to students. Good sense of humor! Always there for help. Fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing		3	5	5	2	1173944	11/9/08	Professor C is the best teacher I have ever had in a writing course. He has a real positive attitude and makes his class very realistic. Really cool guy. Take his class! no matter how much you hate writing you will enjoy his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing		4	5	4	4	1173944	2/17/12	He is funny professor who knows how to entertain. He understands my needs as I am an international student.there is no movie in the class this time.But there is a presentation in final week for persuasion essay.He will grade this and still consider my situation. There is no homework a lot&extends deadline if I need to rewrite again for better gra
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing	227	5	5	5	3	1173944	1/31/11	Mr.C made a boring and required class fun and relatively easy. Topics weren't research heavy and grading was fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing		5	5	5	2	1173944	2/23/10	I am a physics major and I enjoyed his class. How is that possible you ask? He is a very laid back and chill fellow. He is very helpful in coaching you on your essays. He is a fun guy to talk to. Sure, his lectures on editing are boring, but they are straightforward and very clear if you pay attention. I Highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Capossere	4.8	2	Writing	101	3	5	4	1	1173944	4/23/09	I honestly have no interest in writing and do not like to but Prof C changed my mind. His class fun and thought provoking and he wants you to enjoy writing. If given the chance I would take one of his classes again in a heart beat!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy	101	3	5	4	3	759149	12/3/10	Great professor. Not much else to say. He's understanding and promotes higher thinking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	3	759149	12/5/06	I had him as a freshman for an Intro Class,the class was at 8am and although I was half asleep he kept me awake with class discussion/debate. He also has a very calming voice, not monotone. If there was a crisis going on he could calm everyone down. Few small quizzes 2 big papers and thats the class. Really great guy-honest and funny with debates
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	1	759149	1/30/06	Its only half way thru the quarter but I dont think class is bad. NO FINAL!!! NO MID-TERM!!!! 1 small quiz every class (less than 10 questions). He makes a good conscious effort to be fair and go at a good pace. He uses really big words but if you love to argue, this is the class for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	4	759149	8/18/07	Took him for critical thinking, and really kind of hated it. The debates were really dumb, but not on Capps part. You could tell his got annoyed by students asinine comments. Took him again with Philosophy and Liturature, and it was great! I would suggest taking him for any advanced philosophy classes you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	759149	2/6/06	I had fun in this class! Some people just play on a laptop or whatever, and if that makes you happy so be it. But the debate can be fun, there's no final or midterm, just a quiz every class. (I never did the reading and aced most of them) Easy A and a fun class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Capps	4.6	2	Philosophy		3	3	4	1	759149	11/17/05	Overall Capps was a good guy. The only problem I had was that he gave me a B even though I showed up to every class, did all the work and even when I averaged my grade I should have gotten an A. Very dissapointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	4	1258242	5/17/12	Great guy, original and interesting projects. Harsh grader, does not give 100 unless you go extremely above and beyond. Lots of room to reinterpret and play with assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	1	1258242	1/17/11	Cory is a real down to earth guy. It's pretty obvious that he cares about his students. His projects are pretty original and broken down into a step-by-step thought process that helps bring out the most of your creativity. The poor guy broke his leg but he was still willing to help every single person in class, just crutched over one by one. good m
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	2	1258242	11/1/09	Cory Card is a completely unhelpful teacher. While sometimes mildly entertaining, his actual teaching ability is questionable. His projects are not particularly stimulating, nor is he particularly informative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	2	Fine Arts	101	3	5	4	3	1258242	3/3/11	Great teacher, i thought id never be able to draw until i had corey's class. Unbelievably great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	3	1258242	10/20/10	Cory is awesome! He is really open-minded as to where you want to take your project. He seems to really care about each person's project and gives a lot of thought to his comments. He is really helpful and he seems to really enjoy what he is doing. Take Cory!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cory Card	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	1258242	10/10/09	Great Guy. Easy to get along with. Good Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric  Cardella	3.3	2	Economics		4	5	4	4	1757386	4/8/13	He is very intelligent, knows what he is talking about. He uses a lot of examples and get the class involved. tests are based on the lecture and hw and gives a practice test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric  Cardella	3.3	2	Economics	101	4	3	4	3	1757386	11/27/12	He was a decent teacher and I would take a class with him again. He used a bad homework cite but he adjusted grades so that the glitches didnt matter. Very fair and fairly easy grader. Gives away free stuff during class. Very short homework assignments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric  Cardella	3.3	0	Economics	211	4	2	2	3	1757386	10/25/12	While he does stay on topic, he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about half of the time. He uses a program for homework which hardly even works, and half of the problems are never covered. Easy class though, but it is intro level.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric  Cardella	3.3	2	Economics	402	5	5	4	4	1757386	1/22/13	Pretty easy class, a little dry at times (but it was microecon), but knowledgeable and very helpful if you ever ask him. I would definitely take a class from him again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric  Cardella	3.3	0	Economics	211	1	2	2	1	1757386	11/11/12	Mr. Cardella was a terrible professor. It is never on subject and can't even spell on the white board. It does a terrible job of teaching subjects. Nice guy but don't be fooled.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	55446	2/12/13	he is extremely well-prepared for this course (he's been teaching it for 30+ years) and very good at explaining things / answering questions. Very fair grader, not easy but theres always a good reason for why you lost points. his class is relatively painless if you are a systems-minded person (low level code), otherwise it might be pretty hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	1	Computer Science	762	2	2	3	5	55446	4/17/08	Have heard he is really good for computer organization. But not great for computer graphics. Just knows what he is teaching, hasnt been able to answer many questions outside his slides. Not very approachable as well, his door is always closed , has a sense of humour though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	1	Computer Science		1	2	4	2	55446	6/12/07	As others have said, he knows his stuff. But unless you get a hardon for the subject matter, avoid him. Be prepared for a****load of work, class time being just a regurgitation of the slides, and exams that ask some of the most detailed and intimate things you will ever come across. My suggestion? Stay clear, unless you *LOVE* PLC and low grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	55446	8/3/06	Professor who really knows his stuff, but extremely boring presentation of it. Do not take a class with him if you aren't interested in the subject matter. You will fall asleep in minutes. Will definitely help with problems if you reach him outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	55446	2/14/03	carithers is da man! the tests aren't that bad and he has plenty of corny jokes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science	666	1	3	4	3	55446	10/9/10	Carithers is a somewhat difficult professor, but his classes are rigorous and will teach you a lot of information. His lectures are interesting if you are interested in the subject material. Overall I feel that I have learnt more from Carither's classes than most CS professors. His courses tend to be very practical as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	55446	3/10/08	I took him for privacy and security, so I can't really rate how he graded programming projects or anything like that. The class was pretty interesting and the class discussions were pretty fun. He tended to get sort of boring during lectures concerning security, but overall i'd totally recommend him ONLY for privacy and security.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science	571	3	5	5	5	55446	12/5/06	His class involved a lot of work, but he was a really good teacher. He was very helpful both in and out of class, and has a good sense of humor to keep things interesting. As long as you're serious about the class, he will make sure you understand what you need to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Carithers	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	4	3	3	55446	10/18/05	Ok guy, tough but fair. Pretty even teacher, don't avoid, but don't go out of your way for him either.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Carrano	2.4	1	Engineering	422	3	2	3	4	859912	8/2/12	The class isn't impossible. You just need to put in several hours on projects. He doesn't help because you are suppose to figure it out. He isn't a bad professor, just challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Carrano	2.4	0	Engineering		2	2	2	3	859912	8/5/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Carrano	2.4	0	Engineering		3	2	1	3	859912	6/20/06	This guy is a huge boob! Avoid him like the plague. He is unable to communicate either verbally or in the written english language. Sometimes when he gets excited, he begins scribbling out of control on the board. This makes his seamingly pointless remarks even harder to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Carrano	2.4	0	Engineering	792	1	1	1	3	859912	1/27/11	A hard guy to cope with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Carrano	2.4	2	Engineering	719	2	5	5	5	859912	3/19/08	He was my Graduate adviser and mentor for my graduate studies during 2000-2002 time frame. I owe everything I know and everything I am in my career to him. Best adviser you can have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamar Carroll	2.4	0	History	101	2	1	2	1	1622385	12/10/12	She's horrible. Day 1 she accused many of us of plagarism after not telling us AT ALL how she wanted things cited. (i used standard MLA). As the year went on she assigned terribly long reading assignments and shared way too much personal info no one cared about. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamar Carroll	2.4	0	History	305	4	2	2	2	1622385	10/27/11	She drones on and on all class reading directly from her notes. She also seems intimidated by the interpreters and talks very slowly at times, and does not seem to realize that sign language has a different sentence structure. She is fairly nice, but it is impossible to stay awake and pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamar Carroll	2.4	0	History		5	2	2	2	1622385	11/10/11	Easy Grader, and class, but I've never had a more boring teacher. required one essay per week, but no matter how bad mine were, i always got 95s. take if you want an A and don't care about History.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamar Carroll	2.4	2	History		5	4	4	1	1622385	9/29/11	She just reads her notes. And periodically asks a question based on what she spoke and wont continue until someone responds.This sometimes leads to an awkward pause in almost every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Carter	4.0	2	Biology	304	3	4	4	4	1190905	10/24/08	Decent teacher. I had her for her first class here and it showed a little in that her first test was really hard, second really easy. So she was just getting used to teaching. Class was good if you paid attention to do well on tests even with minimal studying, but labs were really bad. All based on drawing and not knowlege. Overall just ok.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	4	5	4	1344100	6/10/12	Fantastic, he kept things interesting and was very friendly. He always had cool facts about the plays we read and their history.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	465	4	5	5	3	1344100	1/17/12	Great professor!!! He knows what he is talking about and is willing to help you out if you ask questions. The class them is terrorism and it's better than writing essays on how to write essays. You will definitely get into great discussions throughout class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	227	4	5	5	2	1344100	8/2/11	Great teacher. He's very enthusiastic and engaging. Knows the subjct material very well. Takes late papers with no penalty. Allows you to rewrite for higher grade. There's no excuse not to get an A in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	4	5	2	1344100	4/5/11	I thought the class was going to be boring and all about writing mechanics. Definitely not. The class turned out to be an engaging, interesting, and informative class on militant islam and terrorism. This guy knows his stuff!! I enjoy attending his classes and his workload was reasonable and interesting. I Highly recommend taking his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	1	English		2	2	3	2	1344100	2/2/11	This is not a writing class! His topic is Islamic terrorism and that is basically all he talks about. He grades mostly on content not writing, so if you want a really easy class and don't care much about terrorism, don't take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		4	4	5	3	1344100	11/28/10	A nice guy. Very smart and passionate about his beliefs, but does welcome students' opinions. A fair grader, too. His writing seminar class was very interesting and you will learn a lot. I do recommend Dr. Caschetta.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	400	4	5	5	4	1344100	9/30/10	Professor Caschetta is not biased. There were a number of times he disagreed with what I said, but if I could make a good argument and support my opinion he welcomed it. He graded tough but fair. If you do the work and come to class prepared there is no reason you can't get an "A" in his class. Lecture were both informative and interesting!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	101	3	5	5	4	1344100	4/22/10	A lot of people say that Dr. Caschetta is biased and opinionated, but he's not. He gives both sides to the story and is extremely well educated. I've learned a lot from his class and he is a great teacher and a great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	1	English		4	1	5	1	1344100	10/6/09	Biased, opinionated, and doesn't know when to stop talking about random topics. Grading was random and unsupported by evidence. Seminar is based solely on one major grade even though it's a low level class. Wouldn't recommend him...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	0	English	227	1	1	1	1	1344100	5/4/09	He is the worse professor ever. He doesn't grade well at all.He is opinionated at everything he grades. I took this class because he received good ratings I regret it. It is the worst class I have right now. HE is so boring and a grown version of a creepy RIT guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	0	English		1	1	1	1	1344100	2/8/12	I had writing seminar with him and he is the worst professor I ever head. This is not a writing seminar and all the essays are graded according to his point of view. He grades low if you don't believe in his point of view because all my essay was full of comments about him disagreeing with my point of view. Didn't learn a single thing about writing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	1	English		3	3	3	2	1344100	11/27/11	For Literary/Cultural studies, he was okay. Nice/funny guy. Attendance was pretty much mandatory despite nothing he talked about in class was actually important nor entertaining. Final exam was open note, book, and open laptop. I don't think I would take him again, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		4	5	5	4	1344100	4/26/11	Take his class! I took writing seminar twice and his class is far better than others. His theme is terrorism but you learn so much about writing, especially writing opinion & informative papers which is very useful to know. If you want respect in his class, participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	0	English		1	2	1	1	1344100	2/15/11	Definitely not a writing class! I could have benefited from an actual writing class and this was a disappointment. Seems like he should have been a political science major because he definitely cares more about terrorism then writing. The only thing that he did for us related to writing was give us an MLA sheet. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	1	English		2	2	4	3	1344100	12/10/10	I enjoyed this professor because I learned a lot about terrorism in his class. However, I didn't really learn a lot about writing at all. The whole class was just a discussion about terrorism and although it was interesting, I think it should be a current events class or something of that sort instead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	5	5	5	1344100	11/11/10	Dr. Caschetta has truly inspired me to look in to the topic that is affecting all globally, terrorism. When I first entered the class I was a little hesitant,but his passion overcomes you and drives you to think. He presents both sides of the argument very clearly and allows you to form your own opinions on matters without punishment.Very inspiring
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	4	4	4	1344100	4/26/10	Professor Caschetta is quite possibly one of the smartest teachers I have ever had. To the people who believe he is biased and one sided, this is simply untrue. He provides both sides of the story and allows students to form their own opinions. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	5	5	4	1344100	2/2/10	This guy really keeps this class interesting. Have to write a few papers but he provides you with paper sources and he is willing to make time for you. Also puts down everything you need to do for your paper rewrites and makes them a new grade. Great if you hate political correctness. Would take another class with him in a heartbeat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	5	5	2	1344100	8/18/09	Great teacher. He is very helpful and passionate about the subject he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	1	English		4	2	3	1	1344100	4/29/09	He is incredibly conservative. While he does not force his views on the class directly, he only provides one-sided, misleading material from questionable sources for you to use on essays. He went on long rants during class criticizing the Obama admin that were off topic and very unprofessional. Easy A, miserable class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		4	5	5	4	1344100	2/26/09	He's great! Funny professor and interesting lectures. Laid-back about most things. A fair grader. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		3	4	4	3	1344100	6/2/08	Excellent professor. He has his own views but is a fair grader. The course material is interesting, as is the class discussion. I recommend him and this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	0	English		1	1	1	1	1344100	5/2/08	Extremely close minded and intolerant in his views ...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	227	4	4	4	3	1344100	10/20/07	Considering the material our class happened to be themed around - terrorism and its rhetoric - Caschetta showed a level head. Likes discussion with people of various viewpoints. Shows documentaries where applicable, assigns essays every other week, encourages rewrites, likes to give sources of where his info comes from. Seems very knowledgeable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	210	4	5	5	4	1344100	2/11/07	Nicest, Cutest guy ever! he loves british literature so much, it's adorable. really easy-going with deadlines, doesn't force participation, and encourages class discussion and opinions; you learn a lot. You can tell he loves teaching the class and enjoys being there; always happy and friendly. I'd definitely recommend taking him anyday!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		4	5	5	4	1344100	7/30/08	Class was Italian literature and culture. AMAZING professor. Learned so much in this class about Italy, the people, the authors. He is fun and insightful; whenever anyone made a remark against his claims, he could support his argument; not to be interpreted as intolerant. Extremely fun discussion class. Brilliant man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	227	3	4	4	2	1344100	5/19/08	great guy, fair grader, very interesting conversations. He has his opinions but he doesnt force them on the class and encourages you to form your own opinion. if you need to take writing seminar(or just want to for fun) i highly recommend his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English	443	2	5	4	2	1344100	10/27/07	He really knew his stuff and he never tried to force any analysis on you. Really awesome teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	0	English		4	1	3	3	1344100	4/25/07	I found him to be incredibly intolerant. He said things that really bothered me. So-so teacher, but runs off on tangents that have absolutely nothing to do with what you're working on in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Caschetta	3.8	2	English		4	5	5	3	1344100	5/8/06	Caschetta is an awesome teacher who isn't afraid to say what he thinks and encourages open discussions. His classes are generally pretty easygoing, just a few essays here and there, but the topics are easy to work with. Take him if you get the chance, you won't regret it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Cass	2.4	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	5	274794	11/18/07	She plays favorites and isn't around much. Also lets grads do most of her teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Cass	2.4	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	274794	5/10/04	I selected Robin to be a member of my grad committee, and I am a ceramics major. While tough, I found her to be a great asset and would recommend her for anyones graduate committe. Thanks Robin.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Cass	2.4	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	NULL	274794	11/3/03	Not a very nice woman at all. Obviously knows her business but treats students poorly. RIT hired her because she is in a small field with relatively few women. If you have to take a class with her, don't flirt, and don't ask her dumb questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Cass	2.4	0	Fine Arts		1	1	3	NULL	274794	6/15/04	likes the laderhosen
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Cass	2.4	0	Fine Arts		2	1	3	NULL	274794	5/10/04	she lets the adjunct profs do most of the teaching for her, she is often there but often away from students, and seems to play favorites
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Castelli	1.8	0	Philosophy	210	5	1	3	4	1252626	5/8/12	He's such a troll in class. He takes advantage of the subjective nature of philosophy by preaching his own philosophical ideas. He's pretty slow on grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Castelli	1.8	0	Philosophy	217	4	1	2	1	1252626	2/18/09	Good: Attendance NOT mandatory, easy+blended class, approachable. Bad: SLOW GRADER, limited and unclear feedback, does not check email, inflexible with argument topics, teaches nothing in class, completely useless! My grade would be better if he provided timely feedback. We were on our 7th assignment when he graded the 3rd! Grade Approx: B-
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		2	1	1	1	475160	9/15/09	Terrible professor. Refuses to change grades he's already given even with proof of work. Avoid at all costs, and if you do get him, please be the one to get him fired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering	303	4	1	1	1	475160	2/2/09	The most boring teacher who cant even keep his eyes straight to the class when he's lecturing. He tends to look to the floor or to the ceiling when asked a question. He's too unsure about his knowledge to be able to effectively teach the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		5	1	1	3	475160	3/10/08	Clearly has no idea about subjects he teaches. Is always saying things that are different than the book. Once had to have student come up to the board and do a simple algebraic calculation because he didn't know how to do logs. After student performed calculation, he erased it, attempted to perform it himself, and again could not perform it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	1	Engineering		5	3	3	1	475160	5/12/06	OK class. If you pay attention in class and do your homework you'll do fine on the tests. The group project is a little difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	1	Engineering		5	2	3	5	475160	2/3/06	easy a but doesnt no anythin
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	475160	11/8/04	He is the worst. He doesnt even know what he is talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		3	1	1	1	475160	10/19/04	Stay away, save yourseld
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		4	1	1	3	475160	8/13/09	Incompetent and unclear. Cannot admit mistakes and can barely speak english. A student actually started to teach the class. Pretty easy to get a good grade in the class though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering	315	4	1	1	1	475160	10/6/08	This man should not be a professor. Incompetent to say the very least. Two out of three homework/quiz assignments have an error which he does not acknowledge. Lecture consists of doing example problems at light speed with no real learning. Avoid this professor if you are interested in learning something with the money you spend on tuition.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering	262	4	1	2	4	475160	3/3/08	Having Castro is getting stuck with him...I'm not sure if he can't communicate what he knows, or really just doesn't know anything. If the latter, one must wonder. Everything is done through mycourses. Absolutely everything you will receive, (drawings, instructions) will be in error in some way. Just smile, and move on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		4	2	2	3	475160	2/9/06	Doesn't know his stuff. Students frequently corrected him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		4	1	1	5	475160	11/2/05	easy A but u dont learn anything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Castro-Cedeno	1.4	0	Engineering		2	2	1	2	475160	11/2/04	He was unclear on a lot of assignments. He does not follow a rubric, he grades your paper based on other students paper sort of like a curve. I understood everything much better when I read it in the book rather than hear it from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	2	2	14400	11/28/10	This womans opinion is the ONLY opinion that matters to her. The more I BS-ed on the essays and reiterated EXACTLY what came out of her mouth in class - the higher grades I got, i'm not kidding. Easy class, but advice: Take notes during lectures and use things she says EXACTLY in your essays and you will get an A. No Conflicting Opinions Allowed!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	1	1	1	14400	10/7/10	Hard grader, hard as heck, very stubborn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		2	1	2	4	14400	8/16/10	Story and Structure. I didn't like her much for this class. I felt like I didn't really learn anything. She was very unhelpful when I was having issues with a paper and told me it wasn't going to matter much, but then I got a D on the paper and it really brought down my grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		2	1	2	1	14400	3/19/10	Tough grader!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	2	1	14400	3/16/10	Withdrew from her class. She seriously will give you a hard time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	1	1	1	14400	2/18/10	She will hate your scripts, I tried to make the one that she would like, but I failed. I took it with another teacher, I got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	2	1	1	14400	2/9/10	The most disturbing teacher with upsetting points of views, it's all about her complaining about how awful movies are and always saying how great she is. Avoid her at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		2	1	1	1	14400	2/1/10	The worst professor in SOFA, don't take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	5	5	4	14400	11/20/09	Love her! She is one of the rare gems of professors left in RIT that can stir up some real opinion. She can be a hard grader and sometimes critiques rather harshly, but when the day is over, you will realize that she is right. She knows her stuff, and makes controversial jokes, big on story. Worth all the work and pain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	1	Film		2	3	3	4	14400	1/31/09	Well it certainly will never be a dull day. Adrianne is rather pop culturally retarded and that really hinders her ability to understand what you're doing in films. Just be prepared to explain everything and if it comes to it do a new project that she'll understand better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film	206	3	1	1	1	14400	11/5/10	Pointless class, lectures are boring. The teacher doesn't seem motivated to teach the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	1	1	14400	9/28/10	Not only does Adrianne lead a miserable life, but she will make yours miserable too. She is extremely stubborn and won't own up to her mistakes. Her opinions are all that matter to her, which proves that she isn't a deep thinker. Avoid taking classes from her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		5	1	1	1	14400	4/13/10	Sometimes unclear, but boring class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		2	1	2	1	14400	3/17/10	Boring teacher, likes to fail students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	1	1	1	14400	3/2/10	Awful awful professor. The meanest person I have ever met in my whole life. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	1	1	1	14400	2/18/10	Insulting the legends, and making fun of them. Wow. What a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	1	Film		3	3	2	1	14400	2/9/10	She's they type of professor that it'd be useless to argue with. It's her way, or no way. If you are writing about ANY of the films she shows you in class, SAY THAT YOU LIKE THEM. Arguing your point, no matter how valid you are, will result in a low grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	5	5	5	14400	11/20/09	Great professor. She is all about some good old fashioned filmmaking with film and a good story structure. She will teach you to be a better filmmaker, for sure. People who have stepped out of her class a level above all the other classes. A MUST try!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	2	5	14400	2/17/09	Had her for film language. according to her man vs. self, nature, and the supernatural are not conflicts. She also teaches that all sci-fi and fantasy films are subsets of the Horror genre.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	3	2	14400	1/26/09	If there's anything to describe her, it's a fat pompous cat. Think, the lovechild of the cat Lucifer form Cinderella, and Cinderella's evil stepmother.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	5	4	4	14400	7/13/08	At a school based on the technical understanding of filmmaking, Adrianne is one of the few remaining who takes an intellectual approach. Her H&A class lectures far exceed any others in the program. She can be harsh and opinionated, but not unduly; she will try to provoke students to respond or at least form opinions rather than observe passively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	2	2	1	14400	3/24/08	Uh ... For Story and Structure used all films that had little story or structure as examples. Nice person but a bit out there
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		4	4	3	5	14400	2/6/06	In story and struture her class was pretty boreing. She likes experimental films a lot and is interested in experimental documentarys. Her Production class was great. A lot of free time to work in the labs, and a lot of critiquing. She'll always have something negative to say - that's her job, get over it. Class usually ends early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		3	4	4	5	14400	10/28/05	The film department is full of professors who "profess" stuff. Adrianne is the only one who actually TEACHES. She's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		3	5	4	5	14400	5/4/05	doesn't waste time with unnecessary lectures, lots of work days to get projects done... very good critiques- she doesn't hand out answers, she makes you figure them out yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		3	4	3	5	14400	12/19/04	Adrianne is one of the better professors in terms of ability to teach. Sometimes her critiques of student work are harsh, or just plain bizarre. She's been doing this for a long time, and mostly knows her stuff, even if her lectures are sometimes sleep-inducing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		3	5	3	NULL	14400	10/28/02	Adrianne means well and teaches well, but she can be difficult to work with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		1	1	1	NULL	14400	9/10/01	Grading sporadic, unclear directions, unrealistic expectations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	5	5	4	14400	5/5/08	Adrianne is an awesome professor. I had her for Story and Structure, Production 2, and 3. I have greatly appreciated all of her criticism throughout the year, and it has really helped me to become better at making films. Her criticism can be harsh, but is always fair in relation to the student's work quality. She knows what she's talking about!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	0	Film		3	1	3	2	14400	2/17/07	Very Opinionated and will grade based on that opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	4	3	5	14400	11/22/05	There is a reason that Carageorge's students do the best work. That's all that needs to be said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		4	5	5	5	14400	10/2/05	adrianne is one of the only competant teachers in SOFA. She is wonderful to get to know and has so much information locked up. Take her H&A classes! She knows her stuff. Mind, I never had her for production.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	1	Film		2	3	2	5	14400	4/9/05	WoW. How can people judge others on creativity. RIT is a technical school, but how about some grading on effort, content and creativity. School is technically together, but forget any constructive criticism. Adrianne is smart but should enjoy her work and find less fault and mor promise in thestudnt
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Carageorge	2.5	2	Film		2	4	4	NULL	14400	2/19/03	She challenges you to make better films. She's tough, but fair

Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics		3	3	4	2	66025	7/4/11	Far more helpful than my first physics professor, and very willing to talk about the test immediately afterwards to help reinforce concepts. He was not the best lecturer and grading was sketchy. He also assigned a lot of MP. Those assignments were however very helpful for his tests. He was very annoying with trick questions though, so beware!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics	211	4	5	5	2	66025	4/20/10	Great professor. He's the head of the physics department for a reason. He is very approachable and always willing to help you understand the material if you're having trouble. He grades fairly and wants his students to understand what he's teaching. Take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	0	Physics	389	2	2	2	3	66025	4/13/09	Highly overrated on this website. He is extremely boring and you're expected to do massive amounts of webassign work (3 per week). Avoid this guy if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	0	Physics		2	1	2	4	66025	2/3/09	Incredibly inefficient, spends far too long on teaching the bare minimum, and assigns excessive lab work. Also thinks uncertainties are more important than actual observations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics	211	3	5	5	NULL	66025	3/20/04	He does a great job covering everything in workshop. I didn't even need to go to lecture at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics	312	5	5	5	4	66025	3/9/11	Good teacher, goes through the topics with great clarity. Uses handwriting on an overhead instead of powerpoints, which brings down the snooze factor. Homework and tests both very easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics	211	3	5	4	1	66025	2/27/10	Great professor. Often times his notes are a bit hard to make out just because of his writing style, but if you actually pay attention while you take the notes, you can understand the material. He's very approachable and patient (often too much for someone's own good). He really wants you to understand the material. Take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	1	Physics		2	3	3	2	66025	3/9/09	Throws formulas at you faster than I could process them. Knows his material (department head, after all...) but comes across lofty. Boring even for an 8 am. Very strict grader, uncertainty counts for half of everything almost. LOTS of homework online, which references the book, otherwise doesn't use it. Only plus: approachable outside of class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics		3	5	5	4	66025	3/15/05	Great professor. Very boring, and sometimes hard to stay awake. He is a great prof though. If you have a question, he answers it very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Cardegna	3.9	2	Physics		2	4	5	NULL	66025	11/18/02	Good professor, clear and helpful outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		5	4	5	3	903735	2/19/13	Miguel is a really chill guy. As long as you attend class you can get a good grade. Most of the time you have to submit your in class work to mycourses but you follow along the entire time. He's down to earth and gets us because he's only about 29. He also tweets and instagrams like a boss.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	4	903735	2/11/12	Miguel is an awesome teacher. He knows his stuff and will help you through any problems you may have. He is very clear, but moves fast through material, so you will either have to be able to catch up or keep asking him questions. If you have the opportunity to take his class, DO IT!!!, he is a great intructor, and hes very chill.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	3	903735	11/21/11	Great professor! I've taken him twice now and will be again this coming quarter. Miguel, cares that students are learning and give great and informative demos. If you're taking his flash class I don't advise you skip much due to the complexity of the program, but he teaches it well and makes sure to help each student as much as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology	313	3	5	4	4	903735	6/2/11	He was there to help you and give you advice and constructed-criticisms. During lectures, he did go fast but let you interrupt for clarification. Showing inspirations in class was helpful. "Fun" assignments. Also, a fair grader. No textbook for class but it was recommended. Class: Intro to Time Based Design
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	3	903735	4/10/08	*Programs are very well Explained *Constructive Criticism is given for art, and projects are graded fairly *Gives you chance to redo projects *Has experience in real world graphic design field *More than enough time in class to finish project but get helpful assistance in the process *Does a good job bonding the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology	101	1	5	4	4	903735	5/31/07	Miguel pushed you above and beyond the limits. Though the class was hard, he was always willing to meet with you on his own time to give you extra help. One of the BEST Professors I have had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology	101	3	5	5	5	903735	10/23/06	Awesome teacher. Make sure you have him if you are going to learn Flash.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		2	4	3	3	903735	5/4/12	Incredibly fast paced class. Nice guy but plays favorites, and if youre not his favorite he wont help you that much. you learn so much in 10 weeks but flash is a very hard program to learn. this class is a ton of work but a trade off. itll either come naturally to you or it wont, and if it wont... good luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	5	903735	1/29/12	Probably the most influential professor I've had. Knows EXACTLY what he is talking about and has an excellent eye for design. He pushes you to work hard but its for your own good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	4	903735	11/17/11	Do not take him. He will make the stupidest jokes regarding anyone's projects, even if it is a serious project. He will tell you that you've done minimal things wrong, and then you will get a bad grade. He can be cool at times but take someone else if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology	101	2	4	3	3	903735	9/30/10	He is very nice and tries hard, but I think he gets way too caught up in articulating his points that he makes things sound MUCH more confusing. I got a nice grade but IMO it was WAY too much info to learn in MUCH too short of a time frame. We did a speed-course in jquery and I can honestly say I can't distinguish jquery from a hole in the wall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	1	Information Technology		2	2	3	5	903735	1/16/08	There were no handouts or textbook to follow. The professor was in the process of moving to Buffalo which made him unavailable for help. He went too fast and expected us to follow. He was very nice though, and answered some questions via email.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Cardona	4.1	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	4	903735	5/8/07	He was extremely helpful in understanding the material, always willing to meet up at Java's to give you extra help. He encouraged questions and made the class fun. If it wasnt fun the class would have been mad hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	2	Engineering		4	5	3	4	358685	1/26/12	took her for intro to materials tech. her lectures were not very clear, but I asked her questions during office hours, and somehow she made the material clear. IDK why she doesn't lecture the way she answered my questions during office hours. Her assignments are challenging, Grades papers strictly, tests are somewhat hard. Not an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	10/18/11	You will learn nothing from her, and that is not an under statement. Currently have A's in every class (including hers), but that's because I google all questions on HW. You find yourself asking other students how to do the HW, and they respond "I have no clue, we never learned this." If you use google you can pass, but won't learn a thing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	5/10/11	Works "with Leonard", meaning Leonard does all the work and is the only one who knows anything about what she's presenting in class. Assigns HW that takes way longer than is acceptable; HW average is around 60, and the test grades reflect it as well. Spends least amount of time going over the material most heavily questioned on exams. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	11/19/09	She is a very smart person, but terrible at teaching. She gives way too much work that doesn't make any sense. She doesn't ever explain anything about the materials and her test are VERY DIFFICULT, so don't even bother studying. The class average is usually a 60, but she does do a curve in the end. I recommend not HAVING HER AS A PROFESSOR!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering	101	2	2	1	4	358685	11/18/08	she knows what she is teaching but presents it in a way that is above what the average first year student would know. her tests are hard, before the midterm i asked her what i should study and she didnt help much at all. the onley way to learn the material is to teach yourself or go to office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	3/12/06	Horrible teacher. She goes really fast when teaching the computer part so you cant follow and does not slow down or answer questions. She also gives insane amount of work at the end of the quarter
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	358685	2/8/06	Great teacher, knows the material really well. makes you actually work for your grade unlike castro. highly recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	2	Engineering		2	4	4	4	358685	12/9/04	This was her first Quarter teaching Dynamics and i must say that she did an exelent job. I have had her for other classes and i disliked her but this class she was very personable and did a great job teaching dynamics. I WOULD RECOMEND HER OVER LUI!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	1	Engineering		2	4	2	NULL	358685	2/26/04	Horrible, horrible teacher, go for castro, he may not be a great teacher but even he is better than carle, so annoying and harsh, she loves shutting down students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		2	1	1	1	358685	11/25/11	You will not learn anything in this class with her being your prof. The homework, and the tests will not reflect anything you learn in class. If you can avoid taking her class, I strongly recommend it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	10/18/11	BAD. You will learn nothing from her, and that is not an under statement.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	358685	5/30/10	She is the worst professor in the entire RIT! She is simply pathetic at teaching and she clearly doesn't realize her methods of teaching is so horrendous that it drives every student crazy. I can't believe they haven't fired her yet because clearly everyone fails in the class. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering	121	1	1	1	1	358685	9/23/09	knows the material but doesn't know exactly how to say it to the 1st year students who have no idea
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering	211	1	2	1	2	358685	10/21/08	She is an absolutely terrible teacher. She was so dry in her lesson and her jokes. The work is hard and there is not much guidance. She is also anti-social. She didn't even say what her name was on the first day of class until I asked her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	358685	2/28/06	This teacher if very nice and understanding although she is a hard grader you will learn the material. I recomend her to castro.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	2	Engineering		5	4	4	5	358685	9/28/05	Had her for Solid Modeling. Took it online over the summer. It was outside of my major, but I wanted to learn another CAD program. While it was mainly self taught, it wasn't bad, and she answered questions well through email.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Beth Carle	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	NULL	358685	3/31/04	Terrible teacher for both solid modeling AND Intro to materials tech. Teaches poorly, and grades extremely harshly. Tests are nightmares, and you won't get a damn thing out of the class except a lot of stress. Castro is worse, but grades much easier
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified		4	4	4	5	1187032	5/22/12	Very nice and approachable- strict with attendance but understanding if you make the effort to explain. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified		4	5	4	4	1187032	2/28/12	Marge has great personality and charm with ASL. You'll almost forget she's deaf. However, she rarely responds to emails and can be a tough grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified		4	5	5	4	1187032	2/22/12	Marge is the best ASL teacher at RIT, don't take it with anyone else! Homework and tests are fair, she really teaches you a lot about the subject if you are really into ASL. I'll miss going to this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified		2	5	4	5	1187032	2/19/09	Really nice and helpful, keeps class interesting, but one of the hardest graders I've ever had. Overall would recommend, but make sure you do the homework and do it thoroughly (not hard to do).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified	390	4	5	5	4	1187032	4/2/12	Marge was very kind and encouraging, very good for a beginner class. She's very approachable if you have question sand does her best to make sure you understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marguerite Carrillo	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	3	1187032	2/24/12	BEST ASL teacher. Do not take course with anyone else. Fun, interesting, relaxed, great teacher. You WILL learn ASL.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	749105	1/22/13	Awesome professor. Explains everything in detail, is extremely friendly, and also fun! He really gets to know his students and is a great change of pace in a hectic schedule
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	2	749105	2/21/12	I love Graham. He's really chill, funny and helpful. He cares about craftsmanship above all, but he's a fair grader. Graham was my favorite foundations professor. Take his section if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	0	Fine Arts	370	1	1	1	3	749105	4/10/10	Totally unclear, unapproachable. Played favorites with my class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		4	3	4	3	749105	3/15/07	He is a really cool guy and his class is fun, really like his teaching methods and is one of the best 3D design prof, he wants his students to have good craftsmanship, but i bet you'll learn a lot and have fun with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	3	749105	3/1/06	Grham is on of my fav teachers!Its true he expects alot from us but he only does it beacuse he wants you(the student)to do well.If you need any help he is there,all you need to do is ask. He makes class fun and interesting with some stories from the past.Trust me he will only make you look stupid if you already made yourself look stupid.He is THEMA
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	1	749105	11/7/05	He is not a professor you can talk to, because you might end up in one of his stories at his other school. He dose not explain anything, just tells you to do it and when you ask a question he makes you look stupid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	749105	2/27/12	Best 3D design foundation professor hands down. Gives reasonable assignments with plenty of time. Easy grader too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		4	4	5	1	749105	1/19/12	Have his class now. I'm a 2D major and will never have to use 3D after this class, but her really teaches you how much craftsmanship matters. He grades based on your major (easier grading if you are in a 2D major like illustration or graphic design.) I love his stories and he's pretty helpful if you ask questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	749105	11/16/07	Excellent teacher. Don't take anyone else's 3d class. All projects are helpful (at least coming from an industrial design major). Would love to take another class with Graham. Funny, easygoing and helpful. A must!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		1	4	5	5	749105	11/1/06	Great professor. He's very helpful and fun to be around. His stories are pretty funny. He's very accurate when explaining assignments and very keen on precision.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Graham Carson	4.0	2	Fine Arts		3	4	5	2	749105	1/30/06	I enjoyed Grahm's class immensely. He was always available for help before, after and during class. He does expect a great deal of work, and always stresses precision in your work. For those that want to slack off I wouldn't suggest attempting to take his class because yes he will call you on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	157633	9/24/10	I was in Gunther's first class at RIT, back in 1977. He was a great teacher. And from what I've heard, he's only gotten better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	157633	5/6/10	I wish I still had my Gunthalator 4x5 film processing try!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	1	Fine Arts		1	3	3	4	157633	12/8/08	Ahhhh!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	5	157633	4/16/07	Gets a bum wrap just because he holds students to a higher standard than most professors. Quite frankly, Gunther is the best photo professor I've had between two different colleges. Knows his art and does everything he can to make sure you know it too,even if that means his comments are "hurtful" or "rip you down". Take him if you want a challenge.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	5	157633	11/18/05	Gunther is a man with a huge ego. Tred carefully because if you hurt his ego-your time in his class will not be pretty. Furthermore the fact that he's a hard makes you feel like you're learning a lot. Upon leaving his class and going through other critiques you'll realize his "rules" mean absolutely nothing. He also refuses to teach digital.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	157633	10/10/05	There is only one type of person who doesnt like Gunther, and that is the photo student who is completly full of themselves and refuses to take his intelligent input and put it to use, or learn anything. Come on...hes training you to be a professional! Why would someone shell out 30 g's a year for a photo teacher to tell them everything is great!?

He repeats himself, he nitpicks, but he knows his crap. ABSOLUTELY SUMPTUOUS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	157633	11/17/04	AMAZING, Brutally Honest
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	157633	6/4/10	Opened my eyes to great work, and was demanding enough to instill a sense of discipline in all his students. I'm still using everything he taught us today. Well, maybe not the Zone system.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	157633	5/13/09	Profound positive impact on my photography. Honest critiques, extremely knowledgeable, appreciates students who are serious about photography. Thanks ****her!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	1	Fine Arts		2	3	2	5	157633	2/5/07	Since i entered his class i had mixed feelings about him and his at times extremely tough projects Most of the time i gave all i could and still wound up with him saying if you gave me a little more effort you could get out of the C+ Range yet if you do what he wants i'm sure you can get a good grade I aparently haven't been able to do it good luck
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	157633	12/12/05	ONE OF THE BEST PHOTO TEACHERS AT RIT. Does not sugar coat things like many other teachers. Tough but honest. Everyone should take him before they graduate.

Knows his stuff and expects you to know yours. Prepares you for a cut-throat profession, if you can't cut it in his class you won't be able to cut it in the photography business, you should c

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	NULL	157633	11/15/03	If you listen to him you will learn. If you have an ego problem you will fail and get bitter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gunther Cartwright	3.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	NULL	157633	12/30/03	I liked the class and found him very knowledgable. Don't go into his class to prove your genious and be attentive to his lectures and you can do fine. He's tough.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	1327090	2/25/13	Chris was a great coding professor. He really seems to care about the subject and his students, and wants to make the learning experience as fun and engaging as possible. Going to class never seemed like a chore, and all assignments were fair. I'd highly recommend taking a class with Chris if you get the opportunity!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1327090	10/24/12	best gsd professor. his classes fill quickly though. take this class. you wont regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	4	1327090	5/17/12	Had him for GSD 1 through 3. He is a wonderful programming teacher. I've never programmed before college and he made it easy. Some assignments are unclear, but go find him and talk to him or the TAs and they'll help you. 10/10 would bang
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	1327090	2/21/12	Chris is fun and interesting in class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1327090	11/29/11	Great prof. Funny, smart, always willing to answer question. You walk away from his courses with the information you expected to learn in the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Cascioli	4.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1327090	10/23/12	Cascioli is my personal favorite teacher. He's a total geek, and really easy to approach and talk to (I've discussed everything from the Magic card game to how to get easy A's in other programming teacher's classes). He's also really laid back and he'll let the class go early if it ends late on a Friday afternoon. Highly recommend!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Castellano	2.9	2	Criminal Justice	301	1	5	5	3	346591	10/12/12	Dr. Castellano was one of the very finest instructors I have ever had. 20 years ago I was a student in many of his classes at Southern Illinois University. From there I went on to complete a Master's degree in criminal justice, was an inner city police sergeant, and went on for a doctorate degree. Dr. Castellano rises above all other professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Castellano	2.9	0	Criminal Justice		1	1	2	1	346591	9/11/05	Doesn't seem to give much help and get himself involved in the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Chan	4.5	2	Imaging Science	200	5	5	3	3	1187444	11/26/08	Good professor, and very helpful if you are having trouble. A little vague on homework and what is due at times.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	1	Information Technology		4	2	3	3	296190	2/29/12	She taught the online portion. Very nice and is helpful, but because its online there is only so much. You have to police yourself if you're taking this section. It's a pretty easy class, an incredibly useless, but you sorta have to take it. Regardless of who you take its a boring class. Online courses involves a term paper and weekly discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	0	Information Technology		5	1	3	5	296190	4/27/11	I'd avoid if possible, she doesn't seem very knowledgeable about the subject. Often she wouldn't control the discussions well and conversations would go too long. Overall CSD is a pretty useless class but easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	210	4	5	4	3	296190	1/26/11	Very helpful teacher. As has been said, takes a humanistic approach to lecturing. If a student doesn't understand something will sit down with them until they understand. Can lose the class's attention when there are boisterous students. 3 hour lectures can be a pain but she makes up for it by buying pizza. Several small assignments and labs to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	351	3	5	5	3	296190	4/5/10	Very helpful teacher. She explains all the materials in depth. She make jokes and get the class involved with questions making sure everyone is paying attention. Very friendly and helpful outside of class. So far her quiz aren't that bad. Would recommend taking her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	351	4	3	5	5	296190	12/18/09	Tina is a decent lecturer. Her knowledge is kind of outdated and has an ill get back to you attitude. Other than that, she is the sweetest person and buys pizza for the class occasionally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	0	Information Technology	351	2	2	1	5	296190	5/21/08	This lady is living in the past.. She does not have a clue about anything she teaches. Often goes on side rants about how she worked for IBM. She does not do ANY grading, she relies on graders who do not know anything about the material, so you are incorrectly graded. She also takes forever to answer email. Avoid, and take classes with Hill.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	1	Information Technology	342	2	3	2	1	296190	3/8/07	She doesn't really know the material that she tries to teach. We had an awkward situation where we had the lab before the lecture, so we'd learn about the lab after we had already done it. She also posts Breeze presentations that she expects you to watch. Lab hardware sucks, so pick a good bench for the midterm and final practicals.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	201	5	5	5	4	296190	11/11/06	Freshmen Seminar wasn't bad. We only had class about half of the time, the rest was quest speakers. Reflection papers were easy, so was any other homework. Semi pointless class. But she was really nice, and always seemed happy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology		4	4	4	4	296190	6/19/06	I don't understand the negitive views below.. I thought she was an okay teacher, the best thing that nobody seam'd to mention is EXTRA CREDIT. if you do the extra credit you will get 5 points added onto your overall average! The term paper is a pain, but she grads it easy! oh yah alot of the test questions are taken from the online text quizes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	0	Information Technology		3	2	1	5	296190	5/19/06	I have never had problems with professors here, she is the first one I havent really liked. Lectures unclear, can misguide you in lectures. Does not return your tests for you to study from. My final is next week and it would be so much nicer to study from the tests as the HW's do not cover everything. I hate to give a bad rating out, but oh well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	351	4	5	5	5	296190	7/23/11	Tina is a really nice lady but has a very outdated knowledge of networking. Shes the best we have for 351 (better than Hill, Mason or Leone), so sit back and enjoy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	296190	4/7/11	She was so nice and I loved how helpful she was.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	220	4	4	4	3	296190	12/11/10	This professor takes a very "human" approach to technology. However, the CSD class is extremely drawn out and boring. I feel that she didn't manage class discussion well enough and we usually found ourselves completely off-topic after 30 minutes of listening to two people in the class debate among themselves. Grades fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	351	2	4	3	4	296190	2/4/10	Class was kind of long but I think most 350/351 classes are of this format. Overall the class was well structured and the lectures, though long, covered all of the expected info that was laid out in the syllabus. Tina tries to make the content as fun as possible, and definitely tries to help all students do well. Quizzes / Tests aren't easy.....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology	210	2	3	5	1	296190	10/27/09	Incredibly nice lady. Distinctively "human" compared to other professors. However, tests/quizzes/labs are slightly hard graded. Easy 5 pts extra credit. Be prepared to do a mini presentation and term paper for networking!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	1	Information Technology	220	5	2	3	5	296190	10/22/07	Most of the time when she teaches, I feel that she does not really comprehend what she is talking about. She likes to ramble on, while the whole class is not listening. She is pretty much clueless during the labs. She also takes FOREVER to grade things, don't expect to even have a ballpark of your grade until the end of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	2	Information Technology		3	3	4	3	296190	11/16/06	Chapman is a decent professor, she is very clear with her material and presents it well. Offers Extra Credit oppertunities, grades fair. Don't be surprised if she starts talking about her former job at IBM though, seems to be a trend among all their ex-employees at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	1	Information Technology		3	3	3	4	296190	8/10/06	She was a nice lady. The class was okay but there is a lot of information. The book wasnt necessary for me and I good decent for myself. Keep on top of EXTRA CREDIT bc that does end up helping you out in the long run.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Chapman	3.4	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	1	296190	5/26/06	Tina chapan doesn't cover all of the material per chapter in the textbook according to her lecture. The quizzes she hands out in class can be extremly misleading, especially in mutiple choices (A nor B, and C or D, b nor B; and the likes). It's so confusing, do not take her and you won't regret it. She doesn't allow calculators, unlike other prof.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French	101	3	5	3	4	1112800	1/25/12	He's not easy, but he's reasonable and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French		4	5	5	4	1112800	11/5/10	Amazing teacher. Lots of work but in order to learn a language you must practice it regardless. He cares about his students and if you show interest and try in his class, he recognizes that and will do the same for you. You won't regret taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	0	French		4	2	2	2	1112800	5/18/10	Soooo, the class wasn't awful, but don't go if you're sleepy... he talks for huge blocks and it can be very difficult to understand what he's saying because his accent is so thick. We watched really terrible movies and for the final project we had to make our own movies... way too much expected for a liberal arts class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French		3	5	5	5	1112800	3/23/08	Greatest French teacher I have ever had. Extremely helpful, nice, clear, and concise. I took both French Film and Hollywood and Intermediate French with him and never once was class dull. He tends to give a lot of homework for French but in the long run it's for the students benefit. His tests are fair. Hand in work=good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French		3	5	5	5	1112800	1/19/11	He is a great teacher. His accent is not hard to understand and most of the time he will just speak french to you which is great for practice. Take this class only if you care about seriously learning the french language and about french culture. He will help you out if you try! Also a very funny man!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French		3	3	5	4	1112800	9/6/10	Great great teacher! So knowledgeable. If you're interested in french culture or cinema he is the go-to guy. Very knowledgeable and engaging in lectures. Great sense of humor. Very understanding and flexible with grades and tests. Requires some work but only enough to keep you involved and participating. Must have!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philippe Chavasse	4.1	2	French		3	4	4	5	1112800	10/28/09	I've taken Advanced French III and French Cinemas with Chavasse. Be prepared for a ton of work. If you stay on top of the work load and get everything in on time, he's a great professor. He tries to keep things interesting, and he knows what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	354	5	5	5	5	1533921	1/28/13	Wow she is a wonderful professor at RIT. she always explain the stuff very clearly. This is my 3rd class i am taking with her. she is willing to help outside the class room. Don't miss her. we should all appreciate her teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	355	5	5	5	5	1533921	12/1/12	she is the grate professor, willing to help student. Always explain clearly. I am taking 3rd class with her. Very nice professor. I love it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	1533921	4/2/12	Great teacher! Helpful and approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	354	4	5	4	4	1533921	1/24/11	Professor Chen is one of the most understanding and nice professor's I'VE EVER MET! If you need to hand in a homework assignment late, she deducts points, but not too many. She's always open to questions, whether in class, in office hours, or by email. She goes over material at a nice pace, and only tests on what she actually teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	355	4	5	5	5	1533921	1/15/13	Great Professor.Extremely helpful and approachable. Explain difficult materials in a simple way so most of the students can understand, and learning at the same time. Recommend her to anyone who want to take stats classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	355	5	5	5	5	1533921	9/20/12	She is a good professor. She explained materiel very clearly. She is willing to help student at anytime. exam are ok. Take a class with her. Don't miss the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linlin Chen	4.9	2	Mathematics	355	5	5	5	5	1533921	10/24/11	Best professor ever! Very helpful and extremely nice! Exams are take-home and she is more than willing to explain any questions you may have. Very lenient grader and super super sexy! ;)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick  Chloros	2.5	1	Information Technology		4	3	2	3	1795636	2/20/13	Had for Needs Assessment ... a quick look at the Needs Assessment wiki page will reveal a vast world of things we never learned about. Does things his way, and there's no textbook. He's a nice guy who should have stayed in the business world. Proceed at your own risk.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Christman	4.5	2	Not Specified	562	4	5	4	3	1099529	2/24/10	She is very helpful and very understanding. Not too easy, but bot too hard either. She is very good with handling questions too. You definitely need to do your work, but if you do then you should do well in her class. I would definitely recommend her for any class she teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Christman	4.5	2	Not Specified	301	4	5	4	2	1099529	1/30/08	She is a good teacher who takes time to explain everything. Although some of her lectures are boring the class is easy and the content is not to tough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	3/1/13	Prof Ciccarelli teaches and answers questions very well. Concepts has a lot of material to cover, so exams are not fun to study for. He gives quite a bit of homework and the grader was very tough on us so make sure you work on it well in advance. The matlab questions in the later part of the course is very annoying. Quizzes are fair though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	609837	3/1/13	Tests and quizzes are 90% multiple choice and are chained questions (if one part is wrong, subsequent parts end up wrong).Lectures are good, lab is good. He loves Dilbert cartoons.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	609837	3/5/12	Very nice professor but tests and quizzes are hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	5/18/11	Superb teacher; he puts an amount of effort into preparing notes and lectures that I haven't seen paralleled in any other class at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering	333	4	5	5	5	609837	3/4/11	He is a great prof. I would take another class with him. Prof C does a great job covering the material and testing you on it. Workload in Concepts is usually a lot. If you get the homework, you'll do well on the quizzes. If you do well on the quizzes you will do well on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering	214	3	5	5	4	609837	5/19/10	Great professor. He really cares about his students and if you do what is required and show up to class and show respect you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		2	5	5	3	609837	2/25/10	One of the better professors of the department. I recommend you take this class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	609837	10/7/07	Works hard to help students who are struggling, throws you snacks if you answer questions, or ask good ones. Interested in much of what students are interested. Overall, he;s awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	2/28/06	My favorite professor so far. Very clear, bends over backwards to help you. Makes class more fun because he is so into the subject and gives out bags of chips for anyone who answers questions. Overall, great prof. if you want to learn and are willing to follow along with the moderate hw and studying that's required. Highly recommended.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		2	3	5	4	609837	3/1/13	Nice guy, down to earth and great one-on-one. But Concepts was designed as an online course, and unfortunately is still taught as such. Ciccarelli reads from the slides and doesn't explain the material well. Textbook is horrendous (useless). Good luck 'learning' the Matlab
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	609837	2/28/13	Very very good Circuit Theory prof, Best professor I've had at RIT. Very clear, strict but fair. Usually helps students out with grades towards the end of the quarter. 10 out of 10.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	5/19/11	Possibly my favorite professor so far in CAST. Makes circuits very simple to understand. Creates his own notes that are much clearer than the book. Very prompt grader, sometimes has tests graded same day. Gives out food in class :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	5/18/11	awesome professor homework was manageable and useful posted all of the solutions on mycourses and all of the notes tests were defiantly the most difficult part of the class. overall best professor i have had so far and loves to put Dilbert comics in his notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	4	5	609837	11/24/10	One of the best professors at RIT. Distributes his own notes in classes, because the book is useless. Encourages students to understand material he presents. If you attend classes and care what he says, you will do well. Certainly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	1	Engineering	123	2	3	2	3	609837	3/1/10	Overheads were awful for the material being taught in Concepts in Systems and Signals.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		2	5	4	2	609837	5/26/09	Fantastic Prof, really cares about his students and that they LEARN
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	3	609837	6/3/06	Couldn't have been a better experience. Difficult material, but he was there to help the whole way. Highly recommend this teacher for any class...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Ciccarelli	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	609837	5/1/05	He's a great professor. Always there for help, always on your side. He has a wonderfully unique teaching style, and even posts most of his lecture notes on MyCourses. Highly Reccommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	2	Design		3	5	5	4	955920	1/22/13	Very nice professor. Super knowledgeable and ALWAYS willing to help you out. She will make you work, but it's never outrageous amounts of homework. She's great, take her, you won't regret it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	2	Design		3	5	4	4	955920	7/7/10	Very interesting and helpful professor. Always gave useful tips and suggestions to improve work, and always made sure you did the best work you could. Very clear on projects. Also was helpful with questions I had about minors/concentrations. Overall a great teacher, you should definetly take at least one class with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	1	Design		5	2	4	5	955920	3/9/09	Nancy is very kind, but not very helpful. I passed this class with A's but I didn't learn a thing. She dishes out a lot of praise, but she's too afraid of hurting your feelings. If you want to push your skills as a designer, you might want to take a different teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	0	Design		4	1	2	5	955920	2/4/07	I had her for Imagery. She was pretty loopy and cancelled class very often. Which wasn't good because we missed a lot of time for working and critiques.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	2	Design	404	2	5	5	4	955920	1/7/11	This lady knows her stuff. Learned so much about type and image for publications. She also taught us the software as well! I did not know you could do all this in InDesign. Gave us a real client for the main project and they came to class three times. Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	2	Design		5	5	5	5	955920	1/26/10	Fantastic professor. If something is horrible, she will tell you. If you are a hard worker, you will have no problem at all. She cares about her students and will give advice, help with internships, and give feedback that WILL help you. I Highly recommend her as a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ciolek	4.1	2	Design	507	2	5	4	4	955920	7/28/07	Prof Ciolek is always willing to meet outside of class and she gives us real client projects. She also was great with teaching us software which many of the others cant or wont do! She is a very caring and knowledgeable teacher! Thanks to her, I got my internship over the summer!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Collette  Caton	5.0	2	Writing		4	5	5	3	1795188	1/28/13	Had for freshman writing seminar. Professor C'Dog is awesome. She's super friendly and helpful. You do have to do the work, but it's not dull. Very few reading, the non-text book ones are interesting. I would take writing seminar with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara Cerio	1.8	0	Hospitality		2	2	2	4	1198139	4/3/12	Basically just teaches right from textbook. Very strict will call on you even if looking down for one second. Seems always in bad mood. Not helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara Cerio	1.8	1	Hospitality		3	2	3	4	1198139	11/6/08	Made and interesting subject very boring. She will show a video, then expect you to stay in class while she reads from powerpoints exactly what the simple little 20 minute video just said. very uninteresting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara Cerio	1.8	0	Hospitality	101	1	1	1	4	1198139	8/3/09	She was awful. She was worse than awful. She thought she was the only one with any knowledge of nutrition and refused to acknowledge anything anybody said. I actually watched her notice someone's hand in the air and purposely turn away so she wouldn't have to answer it. She shouldn't still be teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	210	3	5	5	4	1541850	11/13/12	She lays out the entire course in the syllabus and give an abundance of reminders. Her lectures aren't the most exciting, but she speaks very clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	210	4	4	4	3	1541850	5/21/12	tests are difficult, reading the textbook helps, as it is like a vocab test. and they are open book. critiques are simple and easy to do, she drops the lowest grade if you do all three
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	101	2	3	4	3	1541850	2/21/12	Your grade is based on 3 papers and 3 tests. The papers are very straightforward. You MUST read the textbook as much of the test is based on the readings. Take notes while reading the textbook and use it as your study guide. She's very clear with the material. Extra credit is offered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	100	2	2	5	3	1541850	11/25/11	This professor has very tough tests. Many many hours of studying are required and only when I killed myself studying for days, did I get an A. minimal studying doesn't cut it. You HAVE to read the textbook and pay attention. She teaches onlyyy through powerpoints which are also available online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	1	Psychology	101	2	2	3	4	1541850	4/27/11	the class is two straight hours of lecturing. attendance isn't mandatory but if you don't go to class, you miss a huge amount of content. DO THE READINGS. if you don't you will get no higher than a C on her tests, guaranteed. her grading is based on two essays & three tests. definitely not a class in which you can slack off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	0	Psychology	210	3	1	2	2	1541850	10/16/12	She was completely monotonous and didn't really teach. She only read from her powerpoint which contained little, to no information. For not teaching a lot, there was a TON of info on our exams that she never went over in depth. I really just dreaded going to her class and if you can opt out from taking this course, DO IT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	1	Psychology	101	1	3	2	1	1541850	3/1/12	Very hard teacher, the lecture exams are not easy. Even the research papers she gets very nitty gritty with small details. very challenging class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	101	2	4	3	1	1541850	1/9/12	Honestly not a fan of her course nor teaching style. I'll be honest I dont really go to class, its just straight lecturing and its far from interesting. Reading the text book is a must for her class as well as attending ALL lectures if you truthfully want an A. She does put her powerpoints online though and the class structure is very doable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	101	1	2	5	3	1541850	11/20/11	Very straightforward class. Basically you go to the lectures, listen, take notes, & leave. Attendance isn't mandatory but is completely necessary if you plan to do even remotely well. Read the textbook. She won't "check" if you did, but your test grades will reflect it. I learned to like her teaching style, but if you hate lectures don't take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahrona Chand-Matzke	3.3	2	Psychology	101	2	4	4	2	1541850	4/22/11	She wasn't easy, but I learned to love psychology. She is an amazing prof. The class size was small and the examples were interesting. No quizzes, the tests were mostly out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aharon Charnov	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	4	871512	9/6/08	Very detailed in his instruction. Likes to cover every option in the software. Talks really fast in effort to cover so much in what time there is in his class. Also let me sit in on a couple of classes I wasn't enrolled in. Good guy and makes every effort to be helpful

Rochester Institute of Technology	Aharon Charnov	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	5	871512	2/17/07	Awesome Teacher! It will be a shame if he doesn't teach next year. His Advanced Rendering class is especially good. He covers material quickly but fully. His grading process is fair and consistant. He cares about his students and is willing to work with them if something is getting in the way of them doing their best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aharon Charnov	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	5	871512	8/3/06	Awesome professor. Was a student at RIT before became a professor. Extremely talented and definitely knows what he is talking about. Takes alot of pride in helping students, will frequently ask to see if anyone is unclear on anything. Gives great criticism, but structures it in a way that makes you realize how to fix a possible error.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		3	1	1	2	14259	1/12/09	Dr Chen is a sweet lady but she doesn't know how to teach or listen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		1	1	1	3	14259	11/11/07	Worst teacher I've ever had!..Take all the advice on this website!..I thought she might have been different, but she is exactly like other says...not helpful, angry when you ask her questions, doesn't even answer your questions. She's very hard to understand. The only good thing about this class is the tests are all MC, attnd not mandatory.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		2	1	1	3	14259	10/19/05	Eh...she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Never Answers any questions so I'm like you know what the hell
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	2	Psychology		3	4	3	5	14259	11/19/04	At first, Chen was very hard to understand. She'd explain a concept to us, and I'd be a little lost. I was thinking about transferring into another class, but decided to stay with her. I enjoyed the class very much, and she made me interested in taking another psych course.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology	445	4	1	1	4	14259	8/12/08	Dr. Chen was the worst instructor I've even had. She is flat-out anti-student. She made obvious, even laughable errors in lectures, was a capricious grader, and was intolerant of questions both during and outside of class. No expertise, no people skills, and was terribly arrogant and liked to shriek at students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology	101	2	1	1	1	14259	2/2/07	Chen is in her 100's now and should have retired about 30 years ago. She doesn't speak or understand English very well which is surprising because she has been in the Americas since the days of Columbus. She doesn't care about her students and is not helpful AT ALL. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		3	1	1	4	14259	1/27/05	Chen is such an annoying teacher - she is hard to understand but loves to yell at people when they ask questions. Half the time she doesn't even understand the student when they ask her a question and then she ends up not even answering them! Tests aren't hard, but she is a teacher worth avoiding!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	2	Psychology		4	5	4	3	14259	10/27/04	lectures on everything you need to know for tests. tests are super easy and all multiple choice. BONUS QUESTIONS! 15/20 min breaks for a 2hr class. sometimes tricky if you ask her a question. just read the book and study the notes and its an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		4	1	1	NULL	14259	4/21/03	expects you to help her with her research
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Chen	1.6	0	Psychology		5	2	1	NULL	14259	12/30/01	tries to connive you into helping her with her research projects
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1568115	4/8/13	Extremely helpful and not boring at all. is very open to ideas.. loved her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	1	1568115	1/20/13	She is the worst professor I ever had. Not recommended at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	4	1568115	3/14/12	She goes very fast. Tries to put a lot into class time. Very short breaks and not enough practice time. She is pretty lenient and fair in grading, but the tests themselves are quite complex.. allright, but not the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	0	Mathematics		5	1	3	1	1568115	4/25/11	boring, crams stuff into the class time. not nearly enough workshops.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	1568115	3/3/13	Very nice professor and helpful. No book required and the class isn't that difficult. If you do well on the final project and come to class, she is pretty lenient on the final grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1568115	6/10/12	Fantastic, very friendly and helpful. Explains things in terms of programs, which is helpful since the course is taken by many CS related majors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Cherry	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	1568115	5/17/11	Great Professor, nice, clear, encourages questions, will gladly answer questions. Quizzes are simple if you do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science	341	5	5	3	2	609935	2/13/13	I recommend this professor. He wants students to succeed. He is forgiving and flexible on assignments. Lectures are dry but he's friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	1	609935	3/17/12	I'm sorry but if you don't take Childs for ProfComm you are a fool. His class is probably one of the easiest classes I've ever taken. He is the most fair professor I've ever had. Sure, he is boring to listen to for 2 hours. But, as long as you do the few assignments he gives you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Take him, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	4	3	3	609935	10/31/08	Professor Childs is a nice, easy, quiet professor. He cares about his students and grades them very leniently. Class consists of listening to him talk, but you can pick up on his very very dry sense of humor if you try. Recommended teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	4	609935	3/5/07	Easy teacher and a very nice and understanding man. Attendance is not manditory, but he has inclass assignments. Boring class, I will admit, but he really wants you to learn and do well. Go to class and turn in all assignments and you will get an A. Don't slack; this is an easy GPA booster. I'd recommend Professor Childs. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	2	609935	2/7/06	Easy grader, easygoing, oddball Come to class, do the assignments, get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	4	3	2	609935	5/1/05	This class is the twilight zone, the guy is an oddball. Sit there on your laptop, zone out, w/e. Do the work and you'll get an A, is an incredibly easy grader for an incredibly easy course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	0	Computer Science		5	2	2	1	609935	5/19/12	Boring as hell, but an easy A for a class which should be just that. Bring a laptop and you'll survive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		5	5	3	2	609935	11/13/08	This class was the most boring class I have ever taken. Period. Bring a laptop and you'll be able to make it through... Go to class, do the in class work, make a decent effort on the out of class work and you'll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	1	Computer Science		5	3	3	2	609935	9/29/07	This class is probably the most boring class I have had in my ENTIRE life.He keeps readin from the text or his handout;& keeps talking about how the book is structured rather than talkin about wat it means.The only thing that he is bothered about are his assignments which if done asure you an A. This class is easy but is seriously dangerously borin
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	2	609935	4/26/06	This guy is SOOO boring! He reads directly from either the book or his own handouts (Which you have from day 1). As long as you turn in the assignments and show up to class, ya get an A no prob. I suggest bringing your laptop to class and zoning out on it b/c this guy is too boring to listen to for more than 5 mins.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Childs	3.7	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	5	609935	10/18/05	Not a bad guy, boring and a little hard to read, you can space out in here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Christian	4.5	2	Design	200	4	5	4	5	1105955	4/1/08	Awesome guy. Very Passionate about design. He offers great comments on people's work. Only complaint is that he's a bit disorganized with his thoughts at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	0	History		4	2	1	1	345596	7/26/06	He's a little strict about attendance, which is annoying, but it's definitely true that if you're not in class you're probably going to miss some random thing he'll talk about (whether it's part of a tangent he goes on or not) that will later be on the test. Tests seem easy, but he's really picky about wording and getting it exactly right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	1	History		2	3	2	2	345596	10/27/05	Be prepared to straight study this guy's worksheets because thats what he wants. Terribly boring lectures that frequently go off topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	1	History		2	2	3	4	345596	10/1/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	1	History		4	3	3	3	345596	5/21/05	Lectures are VERY boring. And he ALWAYS goes the full two hours. His tests are moderately difficult, but he counts a grade of 80+ as an A, so it kind of balances out. An interesting guy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	0	History		2	3	1	2	345596	2/6/06	I'de rather eat a 7-layer burrito rather than take this class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	0	History		2	1	3	3	345596	10/24/05	it's the most pooinless teacher ever. if you're in this class just drop it or drop dead to save yourself the horror of having chu.

Rochester Institute of Technology	 Chu	2.7	2	History		5	3	4	NULL	345596	2/13/04	An easy professor an 80% is an A. Fairly interesting lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Cicconi-Eggleston	3.3	2	Management	468	3	4	5	5	1553173	5/20/12	Greatest teacher ever for adv human resources. No textbook and learned way more with how her class was structured... Did not see any favoritism. She expects students to do the work. She really cares about her students. Great professor. Take her class you'll live it I promise....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Cicconi-Eggleston	3.3	0	Management	750	2	2	2	2	1553173	11/22/11	Professor only thought 4 out of 10 lectures, showed favoritism in class. The grading was not consistent. Class received homework grades late, not enough time for feedback for the next assignment. Basically you have to teach yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Cicconi-Eggleston	3.3	2	Management	101	4	5	4	4	1553173	3/26/11	She's awesome! Attendance is required, but if you have a legitimate excuse she lets it slide. She is very down to earth and has a lot of real world examples. I would definitely recommend her! Classes are mainly discussion with little to no notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Cicconi-Eggleston	3.3	0	Management		2	1	1	4	1553173	12/6/11	Human Resources Class - she will be nice to your face and she doesnt like girls. she favors people and cancels class a lot but will then test you on the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Cicconi-Eggleston	3.3	2	Management	101	3	5	4	3	1553173	5/8/11	She is very down to earth and definitely knows her stuff! Class consists of 4 HWs, 1 Team Project, Case Studies, and 3 Tests. I would definitely recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Clarcq	4.8	2	Business		4	4	4	2	476738	10/27/10	Jack is a great professor! He actually makes a four hour night class about business fun! He seems to completely understand and have really life experience about what he is teaching. He is very understanding and tries hard to develop a relationship with every student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Clarcq	4.8	2	Business		4	5	5	5	476738	10/23/05	Organizational Behvaior professor, very good. Makes class fun too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Clarcq	4.8	2	Business		4	5	5	4	476738	10/12/10	Makes a 4 hour night class fun. Very open to student's opinions about the class and changes the class based on feedback. Gets to know everyone's name and involves everyone in class discussions, including deaf students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Clarcq	4.8	2	Business		3	5	5	4	476738	10/21/04	Great professor. Explains concepts clearly, challenges you to think! Very helpful and open to student's needs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Clements	3.1	2	Humanities		5	5	5	5	475685	11/9/05	Great teacher interesting topics and great paper assignments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Clements	3.1	1	Humanities		3	3	2	2	475685	2/26/05	Get ready for BORING lectures lasting two VERY LONG hours twice every week. You'll have two ten page papers to write which are the main basis for grades. If this stuff intrigues you and you can understand it, you'll enjoy the class; if you're like the majority of us who just don't care... Stay Away!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Clements	3.1	1	Humanities		5	3	3	2	475685	10/25/05	Long, boring lectures. Class is decent enough to sit through if you don't mind wasting 2 hours of your time taking a nap or if you have a laptop/something to read or do while she's rambling. The papers are long but can be done simply by taking stuff out of the book and BSing your way through them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Clements	3.1	0	Humanities		4	2	2	3	475685	10/20/04	Get ready for rambling, nonsensical adventures in this class. No homework, no classwork, 2 large essays (8 pgs) and a final "activity". Every day has a different topic seemingly unrelated to the previous days' topics. Clements is a little out of it. Easy enough if you dont mind the essays.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	4	602237	4/10/13	My favorite teacher at RIT. Hands down. I'm not a nerd by any means and this guy made me smile every class, a great teacher to get to know out of class as well. A great teacher, a better man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	2/18/13	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Despite having class fairly early in the morning, I enjoyed this class a lot. Cliver encourages questions if you don't understand things and has a very clear teaching style. You will learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	4	5	5	4	602237	5/24/12	Great teacher, really makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching. He even does this thing every Friday where you can go to his house for tutoring and free food.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	3/11/12	A very excellent professor. Always encourages questions that are answered clearly, has a great sense of humor, and above all, COOKIES!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	4	5	5	5	602237	10/8/11	Top-of-the-line, incredible professor. His lectures consist of explaining everything in beautifully perfected detail and clarity. Practically squeezes questions out of students, and encourages students to ask questions about virtually everything he says. Attend his Friday night parties. The food is INCREDIBLE. Exams are easy if you do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	3	602237	1/27/11	Go to class, do you homework, and do your part. And you will be more then fine. Best Professor at RIT. He cares for his students, and wants to answer any questions you have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	361	3	4	4	4	602237	4/21/10	Great professor! Knows what he's teaching and knows how to teach. Keeps students awake. Loves questions and makes you love to ask questions! Quizes go straight from hw, Tests are not easy, but not too bad. Do your hw, ask questions in class and you will succeed!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	4	5	602237	1/30/10	My favorite teacher so far! He loves what he teaches and loves teaching it. He begs for students to ask questions because he knows he's not perfect, which is great because it makes you pay attention more. He uses the text only for hw but always for hw. I highly recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	4	4	602237	4/23/08	Loves to teach. Encourages questions all the time and tells people to shut up if they ask someone to stop asking questions. Very approachable. Can talk to him about anything. Learn how to use the $15 calculator from the bookstore, pay attention, and ask questions when you don't understand and it would be easy to ACE the class. Tests can be hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	10/10/07	lots of fun. Had him for circuits 2. He knows his stuff and makes the material very easy to understand. Maybe oversimplifies material sometimes. Optional homeworks kept me from retaining material very well because I didnt do them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	4	3	3	602237	2/22/13	Makes the material enjoyable and makes sure everyone understands it in the classroom. However, in the lab, you're pretty much on your own. If you take good notes and pay attention in class, along with keeping up with the homework assigned, you should fare decently enough in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	4	5	5	3	602237	10/29/12	A phenomenal teacher. Every lecture sort of revolves around questions as they are the best way to learn. Knows exactly what he's talking about and can explain everything in numerous ways to accommodate different mind sets. Very little homework with one quiz every week. Should be an easy A with average effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	3	5	4	5	602237	5/14/12	Great professor. Knows everyone's names on the first day and LOVES questions. Very helpful professor. Quizzes tend to be a little tougher than the weekly homework assignments but not too bad depending on your grader. Hosts Cliver house nights every Friday night. Never got the chance to go but heard they're pretty fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	4	5	5	4	602237	3/8/12	Very animated instructor. Asks for questions like crazy. However, you must ask questions to understand everything. That's how he designs his lectures. The book is extremely hard to understand but his lectures clearly lay out the content. He is very funny and excited about the material. One of the best instructors that I have had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	7/4/11	Cliver was my favorite freshman professor. His quizzes were the only very hard part (but if you do your homework you've seen it all before). Tests were very fair. Homework was as long as you wanted. He however was very fun and loved questions. He had friday night parties at his house as tutoring sessions for students!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	361	3	5	5	5	602237	4/22/10	The best professor I had in RIT! Explanations are clear, but u have to do HW and attend classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	438	5	5	5	3	602237	2/24/10	One of the best teachers I have ever had! He works at Kodak doing the same thing that he teaches, so he truly understands it. HIGHLY encourages questions and is very good at responding to them. If you do your work, his class should be easy. If you do not understand what you are doing, ask and he will help you until you do understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	341	4	5	5	4	602237	5/7/09	Very nice guy, great teacher. Loves questions, ask away! Goes over things you need for lab which is great! i hear other professors dont, and it makes lab a LOT harder for their students. Weekly quizzes are usually only one question taken directly from the (weekly) homework. Easy stuff, just pay attention and attend class. he's awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	214	2	5	5	5	602237	10/27/07	You will not find a better professor at RIT. He is the BEST. Very clear, he makes sure you know the material. Nicest guy you will ever meet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		2	5	5	4	602237	10/8/07	Professor Cliver was one of my best teachers I had at RIT. He made the material easy to understand, and made sure every student understood the material before advancing to other topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	123	3	5	5	4	602237	8/23/07	Definitely the best teacher i ever had while at RIT. Ive since left Army and then to another college and his teaching abilities still stand out in my mind. He cares about learning the material and it shows
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	381	4	5	5	4	602237	8/19/06	Awesome professor. Takes time out to know the students, encourages questions, clarifies doubts very well and is available and helpful during ofice hours. Free Cookies too. He may not be the easiest, but if you want to learn, take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	4	602237	10/31/05	I HIGHLY recommend Cliver! One of the best professors I've had. He gets to know all his students by name, always wants students to ask questions, will keep you involved in the class and ask questions to make sure you know the material, sometimes a hard grader but keeps you interested in the material

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	4/21/05	One of the best teachers at RIT. He relates well with the students. His classes are well understandable due to his ease of teaching skills and he is always helpfull after hours. Also his wife bakes, so stop in his office and get a snack!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	1	Electrical Engineering	381	5	2	3	2	602237	6/7/07	He is ok, not as great as everyone makes him out to be. The class is extremely easy, if not TOO easy to learn anything. Quiz questions come straight from HW, which is not collected. Test questions come straight from quizes, so just do the hw. The only thing that helps is the hw, not his lectures, which are pointless, only examples, no explanations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	7/25/06	One of the best Professors at RIT. Explains very nicely. Good teaching methods. Labs are fun. Encourages lots and lotssss of questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Cliver	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	602237	10/17/05	Cliver's tha best teacher in the Engineering Dept., and at all of RIT as far as I'm concerned.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	0	Imaging Science		5	2	2	3	1042743	4/30/12	Don's a nice guy, but not the greatest professor. He often left me confused with assignments and didn't answer questions clearly. He seems indecisive when asked for opinions but come time for critique he's brutally honest and gets more knit picky. He know's what he's doing but isn't great at articulating that to students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	1	Imaging Science	123	2	4	2	4	1042743	2/1/10	Professor's really nice. Always willing to help students. Inconsistent with assignment explanations at time. Great for first year students. Will share his on the field work experiences with you. 4x5 film assignment unclear, otherwise alright. allows re-do's occasionally. great guy, great professor. if you can take him, take it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	1	Imaging Science		5	3	3	5	1042743	3/25/09	I enjoyed Don's class. It was really easy but not a waste of time. Don knows a lot about being a professional photographer and taught me a lot about the business. He is always willing to help and is very nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	2	Imaging Science		4	4	5	5	1042743	4/25/12	Knows a lot about studio and architecture. Grades easy, gets back work in reasonable time and lectures are relevant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	2	Imaging Science	123	4	4	4	4	1042743	2/1/10	He's a great first year professor! Some projects are tough, but sometimes he'll let you re-do it for a better grade. Exams aren't designed by him in PA1, no exam PA2. 4x5 Film project tough-lacking explanation. Overall, great professor. Strict about attendence. Always show up and make sure you have fun! critiques usually very honest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Don Cochran	3.2	1	Imaging Science		4	3	2	4	1042743	10/24/07	Don is a nice guy, but doesn't always teach well. His lectures are often unclear and he doesn't teach very technically. He is often confused with what he's talking about and doesn't always answer questions correctly. One time, we went shooting on location with 4x5 cameras and no one knew how to load them. Don left us and went off on his own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Cody	3.8	2	Chemistry		4	4	5	5	1050736	2/12/11	Orgo I for majors: Nice guy who is great at explaining things. Available for help and research opportunities. Quiz every class (5% of grade), and exams every couple weeks (~80% of grade). The exams are challenging, but graded fairly. 3 exams + final...drops the lowest. Best organic professor of the lot. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Cody	3.8	2	Chemistry		3	3	4	4	1050736	1/27/10	Dr. Cody is a pretty good teacher. Some of his methods could be better and he isn't really clear if you ask him a question in class but he is more than helpful if you seek help out of class. I would take orgo with him again.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Cody	3.8	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	1050736	8/7/10	Excellent instructor. Very interested in the material. Tests are very challenging but appropriate. Fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Cody	3.8	2	Chemistry	231	3	4	4	3	1050736	10/21/08	He really isnt that bad. He cares about the students he teaches, and is more than happy to help anyone with problems with the class and material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeremy Cody	3.8	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	1	1050736	11/7/07	Total newbcakes of a teacher. His style has improved over the quarter, but still sucks at answering students questions. I had to marry the book to survive in his class. If you can avoid him for a couple of years until he figures out how the hell to teach, DO SO~!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	2	137080	11/13/05	He's a pretty good teacher, and passionate about his subject. His class is easy enough if you study and do the work. He's pretty aloof though so he's not exactly helpful if you don't already have a slight understanding of what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	137080	6/16/05	The worst class ever. Absolutely ridiculously hard assignments. He loves to hear himself speak and does care how tough it is for you. If you take the class, you are a damned fool.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	NULL	137080	6/6/03	confusing and misleading class. He is a poor teacher, and has no concern or apathy for the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	NULL	137080	2/19/03	interesting class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	2	3	137080	9/6/05	I had this class some five years ago. Amazed that people are still taking this class. He and his class sucked. His tests are bizarre. I still tell stories about this mad man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	2	137080	11/30/04	Extremely tough
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Coffey	1.8	0	Fine Arts	101	2	2	1	NULL	137080	11/15/03	The worst and most laborious lib arts class I have ever taken. He is a very difficult grader.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Cok	5.0	2	Computer Science	341	4	5	5	3	1246901	1/18/09	New to RIT. I just took him for Professional Communications, but he's a really interesting guy. He brings a bit of good humor the the class, and you can REALLY tell he knows what he's doing professionally and technically. I have a lot of respect for him and his career achievements, actually.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	1	Graphic Arts	101	1	2	3	1	307369	1/31/11	Great teacher, Great attitude, loves her subject, teaches you A LOT! Easy grading, very understanding. Her classes are chill, you can talk or listen to music or watch movies. The only bad thing is if your'e not an art major, go light with your classes. You will spend appx 20-30 hours a week painting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	2	3	307369	10/26/10	Easy A, but you aren't in art school to get A's. You will learn more elsewhere. Would recommend to photo kids and others who think 2d is a joke anyway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts	101	5	2	5	1	307369	4/22/08	Easiest class ever. Don't sweat anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts	102	1	3	1	1	307369	3/24/08	this teacher is funny, i will give her that. she does, like stated by others here, act like she is high 24/7. you will crack up in class as she goes on rants about whatever crosses her mind. dont be afraid to do something crazy, she will like it. SHE IS HARD THOUGH!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	1	Graphic Arts		5	2	3	5	307369	1/31/07	this teacher is horrible. first i took her for beginner's photoshop and advanced photoshop. i've been using photoshop for years, but never had any formal training so i figured i'd brush up on my skills and learn something new. seriously, i could've taught the class better than she did. she had no clue what she was doing and the difference betwe
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	3	3	307369	2/11/06	shes cool.if u take advice and use her ideas, u will get a better grade.take the advice u get on crits.takes attendance and it counts.shes usally late to class in the morning. can sometimes leave early if u sneak out and shes busy.some fun projects.from what i've heard, definately the easiest 2d teacher here. what sucks-u spend $ on every project
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	5	307369	2/6/06	stephanie is a great teacher. i really like her and most of her projects. she's not hard if you do the project she's been known to give vagie projetcs very open ended and even if you hand in projetcs late and miss lots of classes you can still get an a
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	4	3	307369	1/31/06	The class is pretty easy. It's good for photo students because she understands that you may not be the best painter in the world, but you still learn a lot about the basic theories and concepts.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts		5	2	2	1	307369	9/2/05	it took all i had in my to not pull my hair out- suffering thru that class. i learned nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts	109	3	2	2	5	307369	12/1/10	She somehow manages to talk constantly and say nothing at all; every assignment requires additional explaination which can only be achieved by prodding with a million specific questions. Otherwise very supportive of students, excited about the subject she's teaching, and an easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts	101	4	4	3	4	307369	7/16/08	She's nice, a little air brained, and definitely good at disappearing in class. However, most of her projects are pretty cool and do require work. Don't slap it together the night before- they're easy but and A is easier if you just put in a bit of effort. Easy to get along with, easy A if 2D is your thing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts	102	1	3	1	1	307369	3/24/08	she is hard in the fact that she doesnt really explain anything, and you often think that she has no idea what she is talking about. i am still lost on whether or not she has a clue. she acts so high in class that you...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts	233	3	5	5	5	307369	2/4/07	Patient professor. Gave clear instructions and demonstrations. Very interesting projects. Allowed for individual creativity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		5	4	3	2	307369	12/12/06	This class is a joke. She is a hell of a lot of fun, and it seems like she is high all the time. She is deff one of the coolest 2d teachers from what I've heard. We went to a museum, it was awesome. Just do what she tells you, and you will get an A. Her class is a bit costly in the money department...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	3	5	307369	2/8/06	I love her. She gives a lot of work, but she's pretty easy going about it. Listen to her input on your projects and you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	3	2	307369	2/6/06	I LOVED this class. Coming in as a photo major I was really mad I had to take a 2D Design class, but she definitely made it worth it. As long as you talk with her about your projects and make sure you hand in your work on time you are almost always guaranteed an A on every project and in the class. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	4	3	307369	11/8/05	Cole is a decent teacher. The work isnt too bad if you manage the time she gives you in class. Talk with her about ideas.. if you do something she suggests you will get better grades! Just do the work, take into consideration the crits, and you'll do good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts		5	3	1	4	307369	9/16/05	A little spacey, but is fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	3	5	307369	8/16/05	Professor Cole's class is fairly easy, although you can make it as easy or hard, as interesting or boring as you want it to be. You can make it applicable to what you are interested in if you try. She will help with that. Her class is relaxed, but you need to be responsible to use that freedom rightly. She's a nice prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	1	307369	5/3/05	She's so laid back which was a nice break from the rest of my classes. As long as you do the work you don't even have to come to class half the time. She's really understanding and completely awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	1	Graphic Arts		4	1	4	4	307369	10/27/04	she left for 3o mins in the middle of class every class, sometimes more than that, she was not helpful at all, never taught us anything easy teacher as long as you show up to class and do your work, don't buy her book, you never use it, she just wants you to buy it so she can make money off of it!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts		3	1	2	NULL	307369	12/2/03	This woman played favorites the entire time. She graded not on the quality of your work but on if she liked you or not. Don't even bother buying her book it's garbage which shows very poor examples design. Don't take her she is pathetic.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	0	Graphic Arts		4	2	2	1	307369	10/22/04	She was late to class all the time. We never had lessons, she just gave us assignments. She often took long breaks for herself in the middle of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Cole	2.9	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	3	NULL	307369	4/23/04	Really laid back class which was a nice change from my other foundation classes. If you're nice to her and do your work you can get away with a lot. It's definitely an easy A, and she's super precious: nice and quite understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	0	Chemistry		1	1	2	4	1190918	11/28/11	Organic Chem 3 - tests are from nowhere. He gives very little partial credit. Very boring!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	3	1190918	3/29/11	He is the man. Friendly guy who loves organic chemistry and cares about his students' success. At the end of the course, he subtracts the highest student grade from 100% for an often-hefty curve. I would definitely take chem with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	4	1190918	2/12/10	Coleman really knows how to teach and is the kind of guy who you'd just want to hang out with. But, don't take his class if you don't like the subject, because you actually have to get involved with it to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	2	Chemistry	321	2	5	5	2	1190918	1/31/09	Superb teacher, could not have asked for anything better. Not only does he know his stuff, but also he is extremely fair and willing to do what it takes for anyone to really learn organic chemistry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	0	Chemistry	432	1	2	2	4	1190918	8/10/11	This guy seems like a cool teacher at the beginning but as soon as you start taking the quizzes and exams you feel like you made a big mistake. Even though class avg is a 55 you should stick it out and don't let it get you down because it curves out to be ok in the end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	0	Chemistry		1	2	2	5	1190918	2/12/11	Orgo II for majors: Class average is a 60. He only normalizes the curve. Little homework but impossible quizzes every week, and ridiculous exams every two weeks. No extra credit. Has ppt slides from the textbook company..reads them..thats it. NICE GUY, terrible teacher..claims his students need to work harder..but reading the text isn't learning..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	4	1190918	12/3/09	Good teacher, knows his stuff, and a cool guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Coleman	3.8	2	Chemistry	233	2	5	4	1	1190918	10/24/08	Really good teacher. Really knows his stuff and very prepared for lectures. First quarter here teaching but an amazing chem teacher (best I've had anyways) Really wants to help and have us learn. HW is from the book and his lectures (one in same) and the exam is based on HW so if you work hard you could get a very good grade. Good teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	0	Chemistry	208	2	1	2	2	599001	11/29/12	The power points were not very helpful and his explanations aren't always clear. He doesn't respond to emails. Though he does seem to be a really nice guy, I never really got to know him. The text wasnt used because all homework is online, save the $ dont buy it. He drops the lowest test which is a life saver. Cant say id recommend him. overall:2/5
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	1	599001	5/21/12	very easy class even if you have no previous knowledge in chem. i didn't go to many lectures because everything you need to know is on masteringchemistry, but going to lectures doesn't hurt
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry	208	4	5	4	2	599001	2/6/12	CLEAR,HELPFUL,CONSISTENT,FAIR. EXPECTS STUDENTS TO STUDY AND WORK HARD. HOT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	2	599001	10/31/11	Good teacher and a funny guy. Keeps the lecture hall attentive. Sometimes the hw doesn't seem to match lectures. I guess reading the book helps, I've never tried it though. Online tests make it easy to look stuff up early on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		3	5	3	2	599001	9/6/11	A very helpful professor.Wants to help students but it's hard to do so in a class of 80.Very helpful in his office hours and recitation.Will Extend homework due date for you. Sensitive and caring to his students needs. Father of two kids and crazy soccer player.Take him, hes the best prof for college chem at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry	208	3	4	5	4	599001	12/9/10	It's very difficult to keep a giant lecture hall of students interested in a lecture, he managed to make most of them engaging. An excellent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		1	5	5	5	599001	11/27/10	Chris is awesome. Best teacher in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	1	Chemistry	208	3	3	3	3	599001	11/19/08	Presented the information well, on powerpoints and the document camera. Tests and homework were relatively easy (except for OWLs), because they were online. Difficult for him to actually help individual students, it was a 170 student lecture hall. Made the class fun with iclicker questions. And its always fun to listen to his English accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	0	Chemistry	740	1	1	1	4	599001	5/14/08	DO NOT take an advanced course w/ unless absolutely necesary. Hint to Chris: Powerpoints + Pchem = USELESS. Almost everything I learned in this course was either self taught or explained by a classmate. Nice guy outside of class but is an EXTREMELY hard grader, many timnes with little justification. This was the worst taught chem class I ever took!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	599001	9/1/05	He is a great guy...helped me a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	0	Chemistry	208	3	1	2	1	599001	10/29/12	He tries but doesn't succeed. I learn more in recitation. All we do is mastering chem but its only worth 10 points. Each test is online (which everyone googles every answer) and 30 points which why you nearly fail. Good luck teaching yourself with yahoo answers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	4	599001	3/3/12	He is helpful and very bad at replying email .but he tries to reply the important email like asking for what topic will be in the exam.go to him in person.He comes from England and doing research here. He organizes the presentation very well and if you know all stuffs ,you can negotiate with him for taking final exam in first week and get A!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry	208	5	4	4	3	599001	11/10/11	He's a very funny guy. He's also very good at explaining things. The one thing that annoyed me is that he'll say "this slide is important", and just as you're writing it down, he changes the slide. Luckily they're on myCourses, but it's still very annoying and frustrating at that moment. MasteringChem takes forever, but it really isn't bad at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry	208	4	3	4	4	599001	10/25/11	Quite clear lectures. Everything is given to you in lectures, and if you read the sections, tests are easy and homework takes no time at all. Knowledgable of the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	1	Chemistry	208	2	3	3	3	599001	2/11/11	good prof take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		3	4	3	3	599001	12/7/10	best teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	599001	11/24/10	He isn't as great as everyone says he is! His exams are absolutely terrible and he can't teach at all. the powerpoints are poorly organized and he is a jerk when it comes to grading! he also intentionally hates responding to your emails and hates when you approach him for help in office hours! Avoid him at all cost!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	4	5	3	599001	10/9/08	He was very understanding, and although the classroom was not equipped to do actual experiments, he showed videos and used relevant examples. The online homework was difficult sometimes, but when asked, he changed the due date to accomodate for tutors not being available on weekends. LOVE the accent! I'd definately reccommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	599001	2/7/07	Great teacher! Clear and helpful. Showed us a video of someone putting cesium in a bathtup of water :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	599001	8/31/05	The class itself is hard material. He has a way of presenting it to make you understand it. Very willing to help you, and a real cool guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		4	5	4	5	599001	6/23/05	Awesome professor, I just wish I had actually gone to class more so I could have gotten the A. Very flexible grading system and overall a great professor. Plus, you have to love the English accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Collison	3.6	2	Chemistry		2	4	3	3	599001	4/20/05	He's a good teacher and will give you the extra help if you need it. Grade based on online hw assignments and 3 exams + final, but he drops the lowest of those 4 exams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	2	1043034	11/13/12	If you get her. Make sure you do not fall behind. You need to know your math. Her tests ARE alot harder than the in class work. Show up to class, and do all the online homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics	204	3	5	4	2	1043034	11/4/11	She loves math/is very enthusiastic..so much so that she FLIES through explanations making it difficult for people who just don't "get" math to understand new material easily. HOW TO PASS THIS CLASS EVEN IF YOU SUCK AT MATH-work ahead/try to complete the homework 3 days BEFORE it's due, this will make lectures feel like review, instead of a race!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	1043034	2/18/10	good prof. explains very well but her tests are way hard compared to what she gives in class. if you are not very good at math and want an A, dont take the class!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics	271	3	5	5	3	1043034	3/19/08	hard course but great professor. She made math fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	0	Mathematics	230	2	1	1	1	1043034	10/5/12	If you get her try to change as soon as possible. She reads off of a powerpoint and won't answer any of your questions. Bad professor, she doesn't even use the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1043034	11/3/11	great teacher! she really gets you involved, and she loves math! I took Algebra with her at 8am every day. her tests aren't overly difficult if you study/know your material. homework is online through MyMathLab, so you are required to buy the text book- buts the book isn't used.. use pencil, and be on time to class - she gives bonus points!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics	225	3	5	4	1	1043034	10/6/08	She is a very nice teacher, overly excited about math. She goes through the material quite quickly in class and expects you to understand it, if you are not the best at math (like me) this can be a challenge. Her quizzes are only 4 questions long, making it harder to pass if you get one wrong. She likes to make you interact. Overall: decent teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carolyn Clancy	4.0	2	Mathematics	204	5	5	4	2	1043034	10/24/07	Professor Clancy is a very easy going Professor. The ocurse is incredibly easy and she makes every effort to make sure that sudents do well. She often gives out bonus points on quizes and test for no apparent reason. She is very approachable with any situation. Her office hours are limited due to the fact that she teaches at UR. Great Professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67396	2/22/13	Had her for all my first year calculus courses (pbc2, pbc3, and multivar). Take this professor for your calculus classes. There is lots of work, but it is worth it. She is available for help. If something wasn't clear in lecture, the worksheets step through the material well. Exams are fair. She keeps a timely update of your grades online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	283	4	5	5	3	67396	1/28/13	Easy teacher. A lot of HW and Labs though, but since they are required they result in doing well on the tests. The tests are easy plus she gives you a practice exam that is almost the same as the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	4	67396	11/3/12	The material is the level to be expected, but she is one of those profs who talk to the board and stand in front of what they write. the homework covered things we didn't know how to do in class and her grading is very inconsistent. Honestly I have no idea how she has such a high rating here, everyone in her classes strongly dislikes her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	5	67396	5/17/12	Easily the best math teacher I've ever had. I haven't done any calculus since high school and had no issue just jumping into multivariable with her as the teacher. She's extremely helpful and always in the Bates study center. Exams can be difficult, but homework provides a good grade buffer (and she gives extra credit fro early submissions).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	283	5	5	5	3	67396	1/26/12	She's a great teacher and very interesting. She will spend the time to teach you outside of class, and she spends 2 hours a day in Bates, but if you just drop by, she'll also help you. For honors kids: she'll let you make the class count for honors as long as you do her three extra problems every 3 weeks or so.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	282	2	5	5	4	67396	10/28/11	Dr. Clark has it all: the talent to solve complicated mathematical problems, the skill to teach her knowledge to others, the motivation to create her own labs and worksheets, the dedication to grade all work promptly and comprehensively, and the conscientiousness to take the time to address all questions to the satisfaction of their posers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67396	10/11/11	Sometimes the work can be hard but she's always able to help. She's walked me through entire problems, she's checked my homework for errors before letting me turn it in, she's just a sweety. She tends to make mistakes in her notes and examples, but if you stay on top of things you can pick out the mistakes and she'll correct them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67396	3/14/11	Had her for calc 2 and 3 and now diff eq. She gives a lot of work but it's worth it. She's extremely helpful if you don't understand something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	4	67396	11/21/10	I took Dr. Clark for the entire calculus sequence 282,283 and 305. She is the BEST professor I have ever taken and I do not say that lightly. You have to do the work but if you do, you will understand calculus. She is willing to answer any questions and is always available to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	283	4	5	4	5	67396	1/27/10	She is the best professor ever! She gives a lot of work but it is all very manageable. He lectures are very clear and the tests are based on exactly what she teaches. She gives a lot of partial credit and is always available for help at any time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	67396	2/18/13	This professor is extremely helpful. She answers questions well and is available every day M-F in Bates. She has a lot of smaller assignments that make up a decent portion of your grade, and posts practice tests online that are very similar to the test. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67396	11/9/12	Dr. Clark has been the best professor that I have had at RIT. I wish she was teaching Multi next quarter. She is a very liberal grader. There is a lot of work. Something like 9 homeworks, 27 worksheets, 15 labs and 5 exams. But she is always available to assist you if you get stuck. Gives extra credit if you hand in your assignments early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	5	67396	5/26/12	She was an extremely good teacher for very difficult material. Her lectures were concise and notes were understandable. The worksheets definitely helped for learning the material. The only thing I disliked, the homework included applications we hadn't learned (had to read sections of the textbook in order to do the problem).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	67396	2/28/12	The Doc is very kind & very willing to help. However, she assigns a lot of work. Expect 2 worksheets every class period and book work due Friday. You do get class time for these but it usually isn't enough. On the final you get to use a cheat sheet but it tends to run 3-4 hours and be pretty difficult. Would definitely take again. Amazing Prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	67396	11/17/11	Had her for calc 2,3 and diff eq. She gives 5% EC for early work and is always there to help you. Definitely recommended for anyone taking the calculus classes. She is very organized and hands everything back the next class including hw, tests and labs. Got A's for all 3 classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	67396	10/13/11	Her lectures can be difficult to follow at times, but she is incredibly helpful when you ask for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	67396	7/4/11	Professor Clark was a fantastic professor in terms of how much she was able to teach me. Unfortunately though she gives quite a huge load of homework (though she packs in 5% EC). Other than that she is very helpful in her office and the tutoring center and is a very kind woman who will explain something right after the exam if you are interested!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67396	2/12/11	Project-Based Calc III: Awesome professor! Only 40% of grade is exams. Workshop + worksheet every class + weekly homework = a lot of work; however, it is worth it. Extra 5% credit for handing in any assignment a day early. TONS of office hours..she will practically do your HW for you she is so helpful. EASIEST WAY TO GET AN A IN CALC III! TAKE HER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	3	4	67396	10/19/10	Worst class. She gets frustrated when you ask questions. Gives 8 packets a week that are at least 4 pages each plus about 20 book problems. Labs are very hard. Our TA didn't even know how to help us half the time. Tests are every other week and the material is on topics we covered 2 weeks before. Just way too much work and stress.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	5	5	67396	11/7/09	Dr. Clark was a great professor. A typical week consists of 3 worksheets, 3 labs, and bookwork. They are all pretty challenging but I've never gotten less than a 95 on any of them. She's always willing to help and anything that you turn in early, you'll get five extra credit points on. Exams are every other Friday and they are easy. Take Dr. Clark!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	67396	10/7/09	Gives alot of work. 1-2 worksheets per class. But the work is do-able. She gives you time at the end to do it as well. Extra credit for handing work in early. Very nice and approachable. Tests are a big difficult, but if you study and ask for help when you need it you'll be fine. Definitely one of the best math teachers at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	3	67396	6/23/08	Assigns a lot of work, but it's doable. Lectures are easy enough to follow if you are paying attention. Extra credit for assignments done early. Practice exams online are helpful. Though fast paced and a heavy work load, I would definitely recommend for a thorough understanding of the material and applications.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	0	Mathematics	304	3	3	1	5	67396	4/11/08	Teacher gives really hard and pointless homework. She has no life and grades for hours on end. Her tests are really easy I have a 100 average, but her workload is off the deep end
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67396	2/8/07	Worksheets are a joke and homework is pretty easy cause shes in the lab alot and answers all your questions. Also very clear teacher and makes things really easy to understand. Tests aren't bad at all and she puts up practice exams that are close to the real thing. Labs are a joke you just click and press the mouse. Plus shes like my grandma.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	1	Mathematics		4	2	3	4	67396	11/9/05	Extra credit on hw and worksheets if handed in early. Worksheets are sometimes impossible though. Tests are often vague/ambiguous, but usually (not always) similar to the practice test she posts online before each test. If you do the work you should be fine in getting at LEAST a B, probably an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	67396	2/1/05	The best. Nice old lady, very helpful and clear. gives fair amount of work. If you do the homework and worksheets, A- guaranteed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	67396	5/7/04	Doctor Clark is a good prof. Her teaching style is great and she hands out worksheets on the material that are very helpful. However, she gives way too much homework. Despite this, I definitely recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	NULL	67396	3/16/04	Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	67396	9/8/08	She gives really good notes and is very approachable. The daily worksheets aren't that bad and she will always answer any questions. Take advantage of the extra credit on the worksheets and homework...They can really give you a cushion for the Final Exam. The only tricky thing could be the exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	4	67396	5/14/08	Very nice lady, but assigns excessive amounts of homework, does not explain the relevance of topics, does not include practical examples in class or on assignments, and goes out of her way to make lectures thoroughly incomprehensible. Writes with one hand, erases with the other; stands in front of example problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67396	2/8/07	Awesome math teacher! Lots of homework but a ton of chances to pull up your grade. One of the nicest ladies you'll ever meet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67396	11/14/06	Worksheets are pretty easy, especially if you see her for help on them in the study center, HW is usally easy for same reason. Labs can be pretty hard, and Tests can be difficult but cheat sheets are alowed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	67396	10/18/05	Very easy but alot of work Very very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	3	1	67396	11/9/04	Awesome teacher. Gives a lot of work. If you do the work you can't fail. She gives opportunity to make up worksheets. Her grading policy greatly benefits you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67396	4/27/04	Very approchable, very helpful. Lots and lots of HW, almost rediculous, but if you do it, it boosts your grade alot, and you will ace the tests and quizes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Clark	4.4	2	Mathematics	251	3	5	5	NULL	67396	2/19/03	great teacher, uses mathematica

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	60693	2/7/13	Class was pre-calc. She was an amazing teacher. Great techniques for teaches us, simple and easy to remember. Do the homework and you'll pass. I can almost guarantee if you don't, you will struggle. I will need the book, and it does help to have it as she gives out a lot of study guides using questions from the book, it really helps! Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	60693	3/4/12	She is an Amazing professor. She really cares about the class and she is very kind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	60693	11/1/11	I recommend everbody to take calculus with her. Her explanations are very clear, she helps you outside the classroom, and her test and quizzes are kind of easy. I received an A without doing most of the homework since she doesn't grade homework. So easy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	0	Mathematics	226	2	1	2	1	60693	11/19/10	She is not great professor and not good outside due to her part time of job. To be honest, I want to kick her out of RIT campus because she is not friendly to deaf students!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	0	Mathematics	226	1	1	2	1	60693	11/16/10	I took her for CMS about two times and still bad grade. Hence, I hate her policy because she will not grade for homework/attendance that leads to lack of motivation. In addition, she gave us many trick questions on exams. However, she is a nice but sometimes frustrate if you are not good math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	60693	4/16/10	Had her for calc. for management science. She is extremely helpful and nice. Highly recommend!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	60693	11/13/09	Cloen is a great math professor. She really wants to make sure that you understand the material and she makes a lot of sense in the way she describes things. I would always recommend her. I just wish she taught more classes here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	60693	5/15/09	Cloen is a FANTASTIC teacher. I showed up to 3/4 of the classes and still got a perfect A-- just do the homework she assigns but never grades. Grades are based on quizzes and tests. No make-ups allowed. However, theres no excuse but get an A in this class. Extremely helpful and clear. Deaf friendly, too. take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	226	2	5	5	5	60693	5/13/08	An awesome and sweetest teacher ever! Extra help and availability for all students. We learn a lot, collect many information from the basis math about how calculus works. I worked hard to get my grades up, which she helped me to learn more toward the end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	204	4	5	5	5	60693	3/11/08	Best teacher I've ever had. All you have to do is to throw in a comment and you'll be set. No homework are assigned--just the quizzes and tests. Just study and you'll absolutely be fine:-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	226	5	5	5	3	60693	11/12/12	Amazing professor! she drops the lowest quiz grade, replaces lowest test score with the final if its higher than any test and no mandatory hw. she also gives out test and quiz examples for you to study if you have the hw completed. DO THE HOMEWORK! she takes questions from the hw and puts them on the quizzes. if you do the hw you get an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	60693	3/4/12	Amazing professor. She cares about the class and about making students learn. Highly recommanded.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	60693	4/30/11	I LOVEEEEEEE THIS PROFFESSOR! I NEVER UNDERSTOOD MATH MORE THAN I DID UNTIL I TOOK THIS CLASS. SHE IS FABULOUS AT EXPLANING THINGS IN A REAL WORLD SENSE AND EVEN BRINGS OUT THE INNER CHILD WITHIN HER SELF TO TEACH. EXAMPLES SHE USES ARE GENERALLY FUNNY AND EASY TO REMEMBERS SO WHEN YOU TAKE THE TEST YOU SHOULD DO FINE. BEST TEACHER ON CAMPUS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	226	4	5	5	5	60693	11/18/10	Had her for calc for mgmt. Made math so much easier to understand for me. Easy to do well. Practice tests and quizzes are extremely helpful too. Too bad she doesnt teach data 1 and 2
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	226	5	5	5	1	60693	10/19/10	Professor Cloen is, without a doubt, the sweetest lady I've ever met. I've never met anyone who gets so excited about teaching math and she's always so helpful when ever you have a question with the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	60693	2/16/10	Best math teacher in the school. Easy A if you pay attention in her class and do the homework. She is extremely helpful and answers questions with clarity. Practice quizzes and tests are really helpful. If you struggle with math take her if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	60693	10/26/09	Cloen is great! She's very friendly and always willing to help. She makes math concepts very simple and easy to understand. She wants the students to do well and it shows. Grade is based on a few tests and quizzes; a quiz grade is dropped & final exam grade can be substituted for another test. If you have to take calc, definitely take it with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	225	5	3	4	1	60693	12/5/08	I was in her alg mgmt class Winter 20082, and I dropped it in favor of calc for mgmt sci. She's very nice, and has some good tips for remembering things. However, she claims math is like an optical illusion, which sends the wrong idea, imo. Math is straightforward. Literary analysis is an optical illusion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics	204	3	5	5	1	60693	4/28/08	She is an awesome teacher. Explains everything cleary and in multiple ways. She is always available to give you extra help with practice quizes and tests. She really tries to help you get the best grade possible. A very fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	60693	2/4/08	She's awesome. You have an insane amount of time to practice with her. Do the homework she assigns (even if she doesn't grade it) because a lot of the test and quiz questions are originated from it. If you do the homework - you don't really have to go to class. If you don't do the homework - go to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	60693	11/20/07	I wouldn't suggest taking and alegebra class at 8am to anyone, but if you have to take Cloen. I didn't do the daily HW and my quiz scores reflected that. Tests weren't too bad as long as you cram for an hour before or have been doing the work all along. She helpful and answers questions well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	60693	12/26/06	So helpful. Very structured w hw/test/quiz calendar...flexible office hours our of class. Tests are fair. She has practice tests & quizzes which are similar to exams. Material is similar to pre-calc. If you took AP calc in hs, you'll ace the course. Definitely do the hw & practice and you'll do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	60693	10/20/06	NOW HERE'S A TEACHER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	60693	2/1/06	Very easy professor and her test are incredibly easy, drops the lowest quiz, and the final will also replace you lowest test score. i had her both for algebra and calculus. VERYYYYY EASYYYYY. oh yeah and also doesn't take attendance and doesn t check home work. 6 quiz 3 tests and a final
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	1	60693	11/10/05	I failed this class last year with a different teacher, but this year it seemed so much easier. Mrs Cloen is very helpful, has this way of looking at what u did and know exactly whats going on in your head. Very prompt on grading and returning quizzes/tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	60693	11/20/04	i faled calc the year before, so i wasn't too excited about failing it again. however, i asked her for help when i started to get lost, and she had me in her office every friday until i got it right, and i got an A in the class! HELPFULEST LADY EVER! watch out for her mystical healing magnets though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	60693	5/21/03	Good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	60693	8/25/02	refreshingly great teacher, is very dedicated to students' success
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	60693	2/12/07	Love her to death! a real sweetheart. extremely helpful, offers plenty of help outside of class: practice quizzes + tests, office hours, etc. She's quirky and cute, and genuinely wants her students to learn the material. Had her two quarters in a row, going to miss her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	60693	10/23/06	I hate math, but she helped me understand it for once in my life. She is amazing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	60693	2/6/06	This woman is amazing. She's the only person who's ever managed to make me understand math. I wasn't excited about taking math after doing poorly in high school, but something about the way she explains things just makes it click. Her classes are easy because you actually understand what's going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sue Cloen	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	60693	11/28/05	excelent teacher very clear and willing to help and wants to see everyone pass and looking foward to taking calc with her

Rochester Institute of Technology	Juan Cockburn	1.0	0	Engineering	381	3	1	1	1	1544074	2/25/13	Cockburn is a poor programmer and speaks in too much math language for CE students. The homework is not hard if you just follow something online- in fact it doesn't require listening during lecutes, but exams are very specific (and bad) questions that could be googled and don't reflect your knowledge at all. Third year CE's should already know c.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Juan Cockburn	1.0	0	Engineering	381	1	1	1	1	1544074	10/8/12	Awful awful professor. The subject was difficult to begin with, and he occasionally gave outright incorrect information on his (largely useless) slides. Expects you to memorize many equations, specific statistics, and definitions for exams that aren't actually necessary to any future classes. No cheat sheets.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Juan Cockburn	1.0	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	1544074	4/12/11	He is the worst professor I have ever had in my entire life. His lectures have no structure, you have to teach yourself out of the book, and the exam questions are never based on the homework. You will have to guess what to teach yourself from the book and hope that it is what he puts on his exams. He outright refuses to help during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Juan Cockburn	1.0	0	Engineering	381	1	1	1	4	1544074	11/13/12	Will not prepare you for his ridiculous exams. Class under Cockburn is about memorizing equations and derivations. 0 practical knowledge gained for a practical class. Homeworks are doable but take an disproportional amount of time. Tests are very difficult, little to no review is given. Make sure to get the textbook because his notes are useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Juan Cockburn	1.0	0	Engineering		1	1	1	5	1544074	5/8/11	Terrible. Hates knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics	222	4	5	5	1	959036	1/9/13	Excellent teacher. Easy to listen to and very clear with the material, really makes sure you understand what she's teaching. I expect to do well but if I don't it'd be my fault. Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics	226	4	5	5	5	959036	4/23/11	Great teacher, very effective in teaching the material and was always willing to help students out and make accommodation's for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics	226	5	4	4	1	959036	2/2/11	I had her for calculus for management sciences class, four days out of the week. We were assigned pretty easy homework out of the txtbook every night (15min), but she only did 3 checks during the quarter. Excellent teaching skills, is very open to questions and very clear. Just do your homework and take notes and it's an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics	225	2	4	4	1	959036	1/25/11	Good professor, plenty of time to do homework. Lowest quiz/homework dropped. Tests and quizzes pretty long though. Homework every night, do if you don't understand lesson.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	0	Mathematics	692	3	1	1	4	959036	2/16/07	Not a very helpful teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	959036	11/24/11	She's one of my best professors because she is willing to help after the class and office hours. Not many RIT professors like her. Highly recommend this.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	959036	2/2/11	SOOO helpful.Had her 4 Data AnalysisI. I ask lots of questions & she always has time 2 answer them in class or after class. Motherly type-so sweet 2 everyone. Amazing teaching style-everything seems so easy. Gives her personal sched so u can ask 2 meet her sometime. Uses skype 2 chat if u dont want 2 leave home. Good grader & tester. Lots of hw tho
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	2	959036	2/1/11	Took Calc for engineering tech with her. In high school I struggled with some calculus concepts but she made everything very clear and easy and I got an A in the class. I would recommend her as a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Birgit Coffey	4.0	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	959036	10/29/10	Love Coffey! Extremely helpful :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Cohn	2.0	0	Fine Arts		4	1	3	4	1040398	5/21/09	Closed-minded. Thinks he knows-it-all. Terrible feedbacks. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Does not meet the standards of professors at CIAS level. Arrogant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	3	4	5	52259	6/7/10	Take him the first semester if you want to learn a couple things about drawing. He knows what he's talking about so listen to what he has to say. Plays favorites and hardly acknowledged my improvements. Lots of work, but lots of finished projects too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	5	3	52259	3/24/08	HOLY COW HE'S HARD...but he is AMAZING!!! he's the funniest guy in the world and you would not believe how much fun it is!!!! TAKE HIM IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	1	Fine Arts		4	2	3	5	52259	6/4/06	Hard to get an A easy to get a B... Doesn't really teach anything, and his critiques are pointless. Obviously chooses favorites.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		3	4	5	5	52259	2/6/06	I really enjoyed Bob's class. It was laid back enough to really encourage you to stand out and have some freedom. Bob himself, i feel, offered encouragement and criticism without tearing you apart. I feel as though i really produced some worthwhile pieces in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	52259	9/29/05	Bob was by far the best art professor I ever had. Not only was he great at teaching us what we needed to know, but without even trying he made us want to put our best work forward. We would feel like we disappointed him if we didn't give our very best effort. And by the end of the year my class felt more like a family than a class. I miss Bob. And he had a cool beard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		3	5	3	4	52259	8/24/05	he lets your creativity come out
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	5	52259	1/23/05	He was very entertaining. A little vague, but eventually got to the point. He helped me to improve a lot in my drawing skills. Constantly looking for new techniques. He really encourages you to use some creativity in projects that would other wise be really boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		4	3	4	NULL	52259	5/5/04	Very amusing teacher. I've had alot of experience w/ drawing before the class so it was pretty easy, but alot of improvement was visible in everyone throughout the year. Reccomended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	NULL	52259	2/16/04	Hilarious, entertains the class, but you need to have some previous art experience to get a good grade. Hard to get A's, but is very fair with B's.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	1	Fine Arts	101	2	2	4	2	52259	4/22/10	If all you want to learn is "darker darks and lighter lights" then take his drawing class. He gives a few brief teaching demo's but overall he says does or says nothing about your work in class. Projects are usually large and very time consuming. Very easy to get a B, almost impossible to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	2	52259	5/18/07	Fair amount of work, but pretty easy. Funny guy. Really easy to get a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	52259	2/8/06	Great guy. Honestly. Great at teaching. But if you take him, get ready for a load of work.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	5	52259	8/31/05	Encouraging prof, expects devotion and progress. Gave us a field trip to his house once, and personally gave me a HUGE canvas to work on senior year. Great guy with a strange sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	1	Fine Arts		3	2	3	3	52259	7/7/05	Bob... he is a funny guy, but he didnt teach me much. He did cancel class 6 times in 3 quarters if you like that. The nude self portrait was very hard to manage in the dorms, but I loved the water color portion. He was medioccure to me, I reccomend him if you like to hear 'it needs more darks' everyday and want irresponsibility.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	NULL	52259	5/22/04	The best art teacher I ever had. Tough but fair. I learned more in his class than I did in the rest of my classes combined.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Cole	3.6	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	NULL	52259	10/6/03	I had Bob 11 years ago. He gave a TON of homework and was difficult, but was extremely fair and taught us many good techniques. And he cracked me up.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Coleman	2.9	0	Information Technology		4	1	2	2	904595	1/30/12	She clearly knows what she's talking about, but she is decidedly unhelpful, is unclear in instructions, doesn't not keep with the office hours she says she'll have and failed to mention that a required textbook was needed till day 1 of the class. Good person but a terrible teacher, avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Coleman	2.9	2	Information Technology		4	3	4	4	904595	3/3/08	Deb is a nice lady. Sometimes she is unclear with what she wants, and answers questions vaguely. My friends got the impression that she had a "my way or the highway" attitude, i didn't see that so much. She gets pissed when you miss class. Her midterm was hard, but the final was easy. Lots of group work...not bad, i'd take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Coleman	2.9	1	Information Technology	217	3	2	3	3	904595	10/25/06	Nice personality, connects well with class, but does not provide support when working in class. If you ask her a question about about something you don't understand on the work you're doing in class, she'll just restate your question and walk away without helping (Figure it out on your own).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Coleman	2.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	904595	11/9/11	Deb is an amazing professor! (Now by the last name of Gears) She take a subject which is extremely difficult to understand and makes it not only easy but fun and interesting. She explains things very well, and if you have a question about it, she is more than willing to clarify further. The class is a lot of work, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Coleman	2.9	0	Information Technology		3	2	2	3	904595	2/16/07	Professor Colmean is very kind but almost to a fault, since it puts you too much at ease. She acts as though she wants your opinion but when it is given she seems to show very little interest. If you have her for a class, find out what her pet topics are and stick with them for the A. DO NOT FIND SUPPORT FOR YOUR OPINIONS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	1	1189191	2/16/13	I took this for my concentration and regretted it. Tests are all written, very little student involvement in classroom, doesn't use PowerPoint, and voice is a bit boring. Only take this if nothing else is open or you're an art history fanatic. Also, prepare to spend hours reading the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	2	Fine Arts	100	4	3	4	1	1189191	10/26/11	easy class if you look over the material once before the tests. usually boring, I got a B with hardly any effort. good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	3	4	2	1189191	11/24/09	Easy A. Class can get a bit boring though. He goes over paintings and the only thing you need to know about them are the sub-headings/period style and one important fact from it. Three comprehensive tests,one popquiz, one "class discussion" you need to lead. Overall easy A if you study and PARTICIPATE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	2	1189191	11/4/07	He is a good teacher. Very helpful. I am not an "ART FANATIC" and i like his class. I also think he is very well educated, and knows what he is talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	1	1189191	10/25/07	OMG not a good teacher at all. His class is SO boring unless you're an art fanatic or something and is hard to understand because of his hypnotic voice. Don't take it unless you're desperate for liberal arts credit and all the other professors and classes are closed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	3	1189191	1/19/06	His voice was a little hypnoic, but as long as you went, did the assignments and did ok on the tests you were fine. He was really good at remembering names.. which was refreshing compared to the average teacher that usually doesnt even remember by the end of the quarter. Hes like the only teacher for art hist. in the Liberal arts Dept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	0	Fine Arts		3	1	3	1	1189191	9/19/12	Boring class, watch out for pop quiz in 2-3 week. He is really rude. Definitely my least favorite class ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	4	1189191	3/9/10	This was a majorly disappointing class. Dr Collins is much more concerned in keeping with his regimented schedule than in his students' learning. When I approached him in his office hours, I was treated more disrespectfully than by any teacher since middle school. Though he later apologized, I wish he'd reevaluate what's important in a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	2	Fine Arts	101	3	4	4	3	1189191	11/30/07	He's a nice guy with a good spirit. He's a bit boring if you aren't into art but as long as you study the textbook for a few hours it isn't difficult to get an A on his tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	0	Fine Arts		1	3	1	2	1189191	10/25/07	Also, if a teacher talks about the weather for 2 minutes at the beginning of class no matter what it is and all of a sudden 10 heads come crashing down to the table to sleep, you have a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C Collins	2.9	1	Fine Arts		3	2	3	1	1189191	5/29/06	Boring, only really take if you need a liberal art in that slot. Tests are all written and 1 bad grade will not kill you but not an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessamy  Comer	2.9	1	Psychology		1	1	4	2	1798186	3/4/13	If you miss a class, you're screwed. If you can't memorize 10 pages of vocabulary for each of the 3 term tests, you're screwed. Seriously, this class is damn impossible. She explicitly told the class "I expect the class average to be a C through the course". GPA killer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessamy  Comer	2.9	1	Psychology		1	3	3	3	1798186	2/22/13	She expects you to be thorough with her lectures and the book. Book is elaborate. There are 2 term projects and 3 Exams. Exam include 50 X choice questions and 5 SA. You have to be very specific about the answers. Attendance is mandatory. If this is the only course you are taking, you will try hard to get a B. Lectures are boring. Good luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessamy  Comer	2.9	0	Psychology	210	1	2	2	2	1798186	2/22/13	You will be graded for two term projects, three exams, and attendance. Be thorough with her lectures and the detailed book. She grades you for participation in the class. Very picky grader. She talks for 110 minutes per lecture. She focuses more towards the research rather than understanding the subject. Not a very helpful course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessamy  Comer	2.9	2	Psychology	210	1	3	5	2	1798186	2/17/13	All her lectures are based on power point slides which are available online but you have to be in class to have all of the info. Only 3 exams based on at least 5-6 chapters:50 multip.choice & 5 short answers where you have to be very specific!! its super hard to remember 6 chapters and be specific on any possible question she may ask.Must read book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Casey Conerly	3.7	0	Anthropology	460	4	2	2	3	1325106	4/6/12	Very knowledgable and shares interesting insight, but does not create a learning environment at all! She is probably great to do research with, but if you want to learn something, take a different teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Casey Conerly	3.7	2	Anthropology		5	4	5	2	1325106	11/30/09	Really nice. Interesting. Lectures and videos can be a bit boring unless you are interested in the subject. Quite an easy course. Didn't take notes or do the reading and I got an A. Easy Tests and Assignments. If you need easy liberal arts credits it's a good choice. Overall a good teacher with lots of experience in the field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Casey Conerly	3.7	2	Anthropology		1	5	4	4	1325106	1/17/11	She is a great professor. Although her theories can be difficult to understand she is absolutely brilliant and you realize that youve learned a lot after the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		3	5	5	3	1101363	2/26/13	Dr C is a great teacher. She wants her students to learn and understand what she has to say. She has lots of officer hours and is more than willing to help. You wont necessarily need the textbook, but you do need the mastering bio code for the online work. Grading is firm, firm but fair. Not really easy but an A is very attainable with some work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		4	4	4	2	1101363	12/18/12	Connelly is possibly one of the most annoying professors I've ever had. Completely obnoxious, can barely stand going to class. Luckily, the material is super easy, including tests and homework. The class is very manageable, but the professor tells horrible jokes, moves really fast through the material, and makes me want to jump in front of a car
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	201	4	5	4	4	1101363	10/26/12	Quick during lectures, but she knows her stuff. Really helpful in office hours, but make sure you come with good questions. Tests are easy if you study the material well; mostly multiple choice, fill ins, and matching. Masteringbio is easy and can boost your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		3	5	5	4	1101363	5/22/12	Very nice, quirky and fun. Tough grader, makes you learn your stuff but makes the class interesting. Online homeworks/quizzes are awesome (lots of answers available via google).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	201	3	5	4	4	1101363	4/20/12	very clear and friendly. holds a review session before each test in which she lets students know what is on the test to a degree. upbeat and interesting lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	0	Biology		1	2	2	5	1101363	2/8/12	really nice and tries to make the class interesting. but the course itself is extremely difficult! she is kinda rude when you ask her a question
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	0	Biology		1	1	2	3	1101363	11/18/11	acts really pumped about bio in class, but when you look past the surface, lectures are vague & confusing. terrible at answering questions. exams test on material never covered in slides or lecture. DOESN'T ROUND AT ALL. 59.51 = F.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	101	4	5	5	3	1101363	8/22/11	AMAZING! She's very helpful and does her best to make class fun. However class isn't easy, taking notes from the book helped me a lot. Dr. C is very kind and approachable if you get stuck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	201	4	4	5	5	1101363	12/5/10	This professor is awesome, I'm not sure why the guy below me, the one who doesn't seem like he should be in a college, rated her so low. She helps outside of class and is genuinely kind and interesting to talk to. If you do the review worksheets and apply yourself you should do well in the class. Recitation and review times are also available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	1	Biology	201	3	1	4	3	1101363	11/17/10	Okay, where do I begin? Not only are the tests difficult, but she expects you to memorize the material for multiple chapters. No curve, No rounding off. Basically, if you have a photographic memory you set for the class, if you don't, you aint. Oh and she laugh at her own jokes, gets old fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	202	3	5	5	3	1101363	1/24/13	Dr. Connelly is AWESOME! While attendance is not required, I'd reccomend attending daily. She will work with you with any questions you have, but she knows how to test you on them! Prepare for her tests and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		4	4	3	4	1101363	12/17/12	Explains things very well and in an easy way. The labs, although, are really clear with the content taught in lecture. Sometimes Im told one thing in lecture and another in lab. Its very annoying
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		3	5	4	4	1101363	7/17/12	She is very fast pace in her lecture. She encourage questions but must be related to the topics. If you approach her in office hours, be sure you have done some work about your questions. She won't help if you do not show that you have tried hard to understand specific things in her lectures or homework assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	203	4	4	5	3	1101363	4/27/12	While I don't really prefer her personally all the time, she is a great professor. Had her for General Bio I, II, III. Homeworks are super easy. Tests can be specific but as long as you study the notes and textbook you're fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	0	Biology	103	2	2	2	4	1101363	4/3/12	Not very friendly, presents minimal material of which some is on her exams. Goes very quick the day before an exam to jam in as much material as possible, sometimes helpful during office hours, but not guaranteed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	1	Biology	201	2	4	2	1	1101363	11/20/11	Lectures are very energetic and a lot of information is presented during them. However, she does not post the powerpoints and relies way too much on the $200 book. Tests are an absolute nightmare, and way too much homework is assigned. Grading policy is also a joke, no rounding at all, no extra credit, nothing. Good luck if you bomb the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	0	Biology		4	2	2	2	1101363	10/7/11	Personally I think her lecture/slides are generic so you need to read the book to do well. Also her jokes are sometimes uncomfortable and she's really vague when someone answers her questions so your often unsure whether a students answer is correct, partially correct or flat out wrong. Overall shes not a bad teacher, but certainly not a favorite.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		4	4	3	5	1101363	2/12/11	Gen Bio I-III: She is nice, and super goofy; however, her slides contain only the bare bones of the information you are required to know. Her first exam is always easy. The next two she pulls stupid questions that you have never seen in the book or her notes. 3 exams + final, drops the lowest. Does not round letter grades 89.999 = B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	201	3	4	4	4	1101363	11/24/10	Very energetic and keeps class interesting. I really enjoy having her. Tests are somewhat challenging but if you study you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	202	3	4	5	3	1101363	10/28/10	Fun prof, test are fairly easy if you pay attention and go to class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	101	4	4	5	4	1101363	7/14/10	One of my favorite professors. She is very helpful and friendly, and keeps the class interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		4	4	5	4	1101363	9/16/09	Generally a good teacher. Uses iClicker questions as bonus points. Questions on exams directly from lectures, but there are some that require text reading, so do both. Would take classes with her again. Fair class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		2	5	5	1	1101363	5/7/09	She is EXTREMELY helpful if you see her in her office, and is always willing to help...but her tests are VERY difficult. No matter how much you review, it's never quite enough. The questions are all multiple choice, but they're really obnoxious multiple choice. However, with enough review griding, you are pretty much guaranteed an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	1	Biology	202	2	4	2	4	1101363	2/26/09	Connelly seems like a really cool and fun teacher in the beginning but as you go through her course and now that i have been in her lab she tends to get confusing. Her grading is very strict and inconsistant. My friend and i are taking the class and we had the same answer for a question i got the question right and he got it wrong
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		3	5	4	3	1101363	11/4/08	She's definitely one of the most animated professors I've ever had-- you don't need to go to class to do well. Pretty difficult tests, EASY online quizzes, moderately easy HW. Nice lady, decent lecture, obnoxious sense of humor. Take it for an easy grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology	101	3	5	4	5	1101363	2/13/10	Good professor. Very helpful when questions are asked. Uses clicker points for extra credit and sometimes hands out worksheets to those in class for extra credit. Easy homework and quizzes. But her tests and homeworks are graded inconsistently hard. Be prepared for tough, more in depth test material then covered in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		1	5	4	5	1101363	9/2/09	she's pretty intense and her tests can get hard, but everything I learned ... I really learned. Prof. Connelly & S. Morgan are a great team!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	0	Biology	207	1	1	1	3	1101363	5/4/09	By far the worst teacher I have ever had, never has a teacher been so inconsistent with grading, teaching, and examination. What teacher gives review sheets with nothing on there that is actually on the tests, she did this not once or twice, but throughout the entire year! And forget going to see her for help, she is down right rude and not helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		2	5	4	4	1101363	11/6/08	Dr. Conelly is my favorite teacher at RIT. She is so helpful to even the dumbest of students, and her unique teaching style makes class actually worth coming to. There's never a dull moment in her classroom, and you should do anything to get into her as a teacher. And, let's face it, she's got a great pair of.......assets.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandi Connelly	3.9	2	Biology		3	5	5	4	1101363	2/6/08	Great professor! She really knows her stuff. Easy class, just read the book. Her lectures are also very entertaining.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniele Conners	3.1	0	Freshman Year Experience		3	1	1	1	804259	1/28/10	she is the worst teacher ever!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniele Conners	3.1	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	804259	10/23/07	Daniele is awesome. Even though you dont learn too much in FYE, it is a fun, easy, class. You have to take this class no matter what but just hope you get Daniele. FYE is an easy A and grade booster. Also an easy credit hour
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniele Conners	3.1	1	Freshman Year Experience		4	1	5	1	804259	12/10/07	The class is extremely boring!!!! waste of time!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniele Conners	3.1	2	Freshman Year Experience		4	3	4	1	804259	1/25/06	Class blows, but you really can't do anything about it if you get her. RIT assigns you your FYE and Freshman Seminar teacher. She frequently goes over the time limit and takes her job far too seriously for it being a 1 credit joke class. A class actually got her to cry this year... Biggest waste of time -- next to Frank Hunte's Physics class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Cook	2.2	0	Business	551	1	1	2	4	711944	1/26/10	very intense
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Cook	2.2	0	Business		1	2	2	4	711944	9/29/05	Terrible professor. Avoid at all costs. Very unclear in assignments and doesn't follow through on his word.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Cook	2.2	1	Business	743	3	3	3	5	711944	5/21/08	He is good. You can learn many with him. He is nice on grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Coon	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	4	837310	4/25/06	Excellent techer, very helpful and knowledgeable.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business	101	4	5	5	4	1492302	4/2/13	This professor is the best that Ive ever had in all my years of school! She is beyong helpful and very willing to answer any questions, meet during office hours and after class. I would recommend this professor because I passed her class with a B. She still continues to give me help this semester in acct 102. Take 101 with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business		4	5	5	5	1492302	3/27/12	Interesting. Many real world examples. Willing to provide extra help. One of the best and most interested in students that I have had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business	602	4	5	5	5	1492302	11/19/11	Oneline homework and quiz site very helpful. Gave examples from her experience in accounting interesting. Cared about students. Very knowledgeable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	0	Business	112	3	2	2	4	1492302	1/27/11	Very sporadic, changes the course and assignments every week. Participation grades make very little sense. Tests are based on 10 chapters 400 pages of the text book. If possible avoid...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business	617	5	5	5	5	1492302	5/6/12	Excellent. Learned a lot. Was interested in students personally. Thank you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business		4	5	5	4	1492302	12/13/11	Great teacher. Useful tools used.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	2	Business		4	5	4	5	1492302	11/19/11	Taught me a lot. Very Intersted in helping students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Kay Copeland	4.1	0	Business		4	1	2	3	1492302	11/6/10	Useless. Quarter isn't even over but I've seen enough. Completely changed syllabus midway through course, gives totally arbitrary participation credit, struggles with basic tech (ex: sending .ppt attachments or posting to MyCourses), and gives irrelevant stories from her time in "the real world". Avoid her, I've learned nothing but definitions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Corbett	2.2	0	Biology		2	1	3	5	1334138	9/26/12	Get used to "ask the TA." She won't answer your questions, even if she's just sitting on her computer. Only once before a class did she go over relevant info about the task at hand (for a purely technique-based lab course!). Dr. Lawlor's section was far more helpful and informative. He didn't use TAs as a crutch for human interaction.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Corbett	2.2	0	Biology	315	5	1	1	4	1334138	2/21/10	what a waste of space. please, someone tell me why i'm spending so much money to be "taught" by this person? UNHELPFUL. ARGUMENTATIVE. I've seen her put more students down than actually teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Corbett	2.2	2	Biology		3	5	5	4	1334138	5/29/12	Kim was my lab instructor for tissue culture and was great! She took time to explain what we were doing, how, and why. I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Corbett	2.2	0	Biology	202	5	1	1	3	1334138	10/9/09	Why is she even teaching?? She makes snide comments about faculty in the class while she herself is technically some sort of glorified staff person? Spent more time complaining about how she wasn't given money for "her" projects than actually teaching anything. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Cornell	3.6	1	Science Technology & Society	211	5	3	3	1	1334145	11/26/12	Really easy class. Dull teacher, but an easy A. Just do the readings and go to discussion days and you're set. He gives you the questions for the tests ahead of time. I don't see how anyone could get less than an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Cornell	3.6	2	Science Technology & Society	440	3	4	4	4	1334145	9/3/10	He has interest in what he teaches and he welcomed questions, was available for help. However, his essay-exams are rather hard to get an A for - he wants understanding of all the material and, apparently, very good thought organization to give a student an A. My 37th class at RIT and my first B... Do not underestimate his tests/exams - prepare.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Cornell	3.6	2	Science Technology & Society	211	3	4	4	2	1334145	11/2/10	Dull. Awful grader - pretty much everyone gets a B. You have to be absolutely either perfect or terrible to get anything else. The better you do, the harder he looks for something to mark you off on. Bring a pillow to the lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Cornell	3.6	2	Science Technology & Society	211	2	3	4	4	1334145	11/18/09	Prof Cornell is pretty much what you would expect from a mandatory liberal arts professor at a tech school. Not very interesting and he keeps class pretty dull. Grades pretty harshly but there are only two written tests for the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	3	357004	2/14/13	Makes organic chemistry actually make sense. Tests are kind of hard but she curves them, so its not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	3	357004	11/15/11	Dr. Collison is my favorite professor at RIT, she actually makes organic chemistry understandable and really wants to help you learn both inside and outside class. Tests are difficult but fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	5	3	3	357004	9/18/11	shes a good teacher. take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	357004	10/22/10	the best chem ever...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	4	357004	1/1/08	Dr. Collison is tough but fair. When you come to class she expects you to be prepared always. You will learn a great deal from her if you choose to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry	740	3	5	5	5	357004	11/11/07	Fantastic professor. Class is fair and challenging enough that you learn a lot. Take this professor if you can!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	0	Chemistry	208	2	2	2	3	357004	11/1/06	Her lectures are poorly organized. She just reads off of a powerpoint that sometimes is not hers, and is often confused by some of the material presented. The course material of usually covered AFTER a homework assignment is graded, which does not make any sense. Everything is graded online, and she does nothing but read from a powerpoint.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	1	Chemistry		3	1	5	1	357004	12/2/05	She is very helpful in the lab and is very interested in teaching. BUT ! Her lectures SUCK ! She just reads off a powerpoint and your homework is done on the computer. College Chem sucks. If you were undecided like me. Theyll throw you in it. Do yourself a favor. And check to see if any majors your thinking of need this course. Drop it if you can !

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	3	357004	1/21/13	Really great professor, is enthusiastic about orgo and loves to teach. Tests are hard but fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	2	357004	11/15/11	Dr. Collison is the best professor you can take for an intro to organic chem course. I also took her advanced synthesis class and I am a biomed major but still understood and got a good grade! Her class is tough but anyone can learn organic with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	0	Chemistry		2	1	2	3	357004	5/23/11	I wouldn't recommend her to anybody.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry	537	2	4	5	5	357004	2/17/08	Org 3 and Org Synthesis. Great teacher, loves to teach & research. Great in office hours. Don't have to memorize reactions because you learn the mechanism. Makes learning fun. Wants students to learn. Down-to-earth, funny, mother of 2 boys.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	4	4	357004	11/27/07	Great teacher! Very helpful, and grades on a very big curve!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	4	357004	2/22/07	Always there for help, and gives clear examples of the material. Her tests are pretty hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry	208	5	5	5	5	357004	9/22/06	she makes chemistry really fun. i love her. i used to hate chemistry.. and now i love it. doing her homework is rlly fun too.. since all of it is online and doesn't take more than two hours in the whole week to complete it. i love going to her class. sometimes i look forward to going there.. its like a class where you can relax.. and study at the s
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	5	5	357004	10/15/05	she always gives lots of funny example to the somewhat tedious organic mechanisms .You will definitely have fun listening to her lectures coz she makes it really interesting.You don't have to memorize the reactions and the required catalysis because she drills them into your head by making you understand the mechanisms that she shows you in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	4	4	357004	9/11/05	somewhat new to the teaching scene, but adapting fast. she taught 2 sequential courses in my major, and i actually noticed changes implemented in the second course that had been suggested at the end of the first. a great professor to take if you plan on actually putting effort into the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		2	5	4	NULL	357004	8/2/04	Tests are hard, but she is a decent lecturer and she is extremely helpful in one-on-one interactions. Always available for her students and an all around nice person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Collison	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	NULL	357004	6/2/04	This prof rocks!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	0	Business		2	1	2	1	961710	10/31/12	This lady is very unorganized. Took her online mktg and she is slow on grading and never gives feedback. Expects way too much, and adds projects to her syllabus a week before they are due. Super frustrating online class- hardest I have ever taken. I wouldn't recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	0	Business		2	1	2	4	961710	4/3/09	I took her for the principles of marketing online class and it was the worst online class I have ever taken. As mentioned before, it took her weeks to get grades back, and she was not a easy grader to say the least. Marketing is my major and I love it, but she is not the best professor I have come across.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	2	Business		4	5	5	4	961710	1/27/08	She is great. Very helpful and really nice. Her tests are super easy as are quiz's. Usually multiple choice but she gives you the option of essays after you look at them both and then decide which you like more. She uses my-courses and is very willing to help. All of her power points are online also so notes are minimum
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	2	Business		4	4	3	5	961710	2/27/07	ends class early. tests are fairly easy. option of mc or mc and short answers. gives you bonus points to omit. knows her stuff but does not really go in depth about marketing but after all, it is a principles class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	1	Business	761	3	4	2	4	961710	8/14/11	I took her for marketing concepts and she is a bit disorganized and does take a long time to get grades back. Once I figured out her grading style it was a lot easier. You have to really read the syllabus and follow it to the letter. She is a hard grader. But nice and very knowledgeable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	0	Business	440	3	2	2	4	961710	2/26/08	I took her for Internet Marketing as an online class and I am very disappointed. She seemed to not put a lot of effort into teaching, and was EXTREMELY slow/late in getting grades back. Additionally, the assignments were unclear and all of the graded items were writing based (subjective). I did still learn a lot, but I was disappointed...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Colton-Herbert	2.9	2	Business		3	4	4	4	961710	5/21/07	She is a very good professor and very willing to help the students. I would recommend her but don't expect it to be an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		4	4	4	4	1109379	4/11/13	She is an easy going teacher. Read your materials and invest your effort in class. She assigns a lot of work but they're not really that hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		3	4	4	3	1109379	11/18/11	I had Professor Condry for Scientific Writing. Be prepared for a lot of writing. It is not hard nor is she a tough grader but it can feel extremely overwhelming. She is very helpful and a likable person. Just make sure you memorize APA references correctly since she kept on quizzing our class on this until we got it right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	1109379	1/31/11	I absolutely love Prof Condry!! She really cares that you understand her topics. I have had her for 3 different classes now and each one has been absolutely amazing. If you have the opportunity, take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	1109379	8/9/10	I had Condry for intro Psych. She is an awesome professor,very helpful, and cares about your success in her class. She was always straight foward about was was on the test and even gave study sheets. I hope thoses of you that are taking this class get lucky enough to have her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		2	4	4	1	1109379	11/17/09	The content of the class was extremely interesting and Condry did her best to illustrate the core concepts. Tests could be a bit ambiguous, but in-class discussions and easy papers raised grades substantially. Great professor overall!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		2	5	5	3	1109379	10/16/08	Child Psych isn't really my thing, but she made the class pretty interesting. Shes also my advisor and will go out of her way to help you. She is one of the best professors in RITs psych program
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		5	5	5	4	1109379	11/2/12	Take her classes! She's a great professor. You won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		1	4	3	4	1109379	10/5/11	Interesting class, overall not that bad but ALOT of work! She makes papers due way too often and when papers aren't due you still have a lot of work. Not the worse psychology class but definitely a lot more work then I expected , this class is the most work load of all my class. However maybe it's just because it's a writing class?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	1109379	10/5/10	Really awesome and caring teacher. Class is Really easy. If you didn't do well on the tests it probably means you are brain dead and never came to class. She is awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology	101	5	5	4	4	1109379	1/27/10	Professor Condry is the best Psych. professor! Her class is REALLY easy. getting below an 85 on the tests probably means you NEVER looked over notes or did not come to class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	0	Psychology	125	3	1	1	5	1109379	9/22/09	I felt thet this professor's content and organization was not up to par. Yes she smiles alot and tries to be helpful, but I don't feel comfortable with her knowledge base. Frequebntly she seems to mix up studies and the results. Exams didn't reflect the content that was discussed most of the time in class. NOT impressed at all. Cannot reccommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kirsten Condry	4.2	2	Psychology	514	2	5	5	2	1109379	3/10/08	One of the best professors in the RIT psych dept. Highly reccomended. Course content can be difficult,however this professor is willing to go the extra mile to help you. If you have any difficulties she is willing to help you. Lectures are excellent and engaging.Just purely amazing. I learned a whole lot. TAKE HER CLASSES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pamela Conley	3.9	2	Writing	502	4	4	5	4	347652	2/1/10	This teacher expects a lot of writing but she will help you definitely. Simply do your essays, read the stories given to you, but WATCH OUT for pop quizzes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pamela Conley	3.9	2	Writing		2	3	4	3	347652	3/10/05	Tough teacher, but if you do the work and don't argue with her, you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pamela Conley	3.9	1	Writing		2	2	3	NULL	347652	2/11/04	Good Teacher, however for writing course she can be hard on you, but want you to do good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pamela Conley	3.9	2	Writing		4	5	4	3	347652	10/26/05	Great teacher who signs ASL, so communication can be difficult for students who lack of knowledge in sign language. But overall as a teacher, she's willing to help students improve their reading and especially their writing skills. Simply complete the homework, especially the essays, and you'll have no problem in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pamela Conley	3.9	2	Writing		2	4	5	3	347652	2/5/05	She's a very good teacher but tough. I would recommend you to take her if you want challenge with good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Connelly	5.0	2	Physical Ed		3	5	5	5	564864	4/21/10	The reason why I am still at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	0	English	227	3	2	2	2	485030	10/29/12	You need 12 pages of writing for the whole quarter so it's not too much, but the material forces writing about a certain topic. There is little flexibility for the topics of the papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	2	English		4	4	4	3	485030	9/4/10	This is an intelligent professor. Dr. Connor challenges your thinking and has you learn beyond your expectations. Good grades aren't difficult as long as you participate in the process. Be open and take his classes. I have twice, and would again if he had more available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	2	English		5	4	3	2	485030	10/25/05	Kinda wings it in class, but easy A as long as you just do what he says. Its real simple, not a lot of work, hardly any readings, movies in class :D You write maybe one paper a quarter? Easy A, he even cancels classes on occasion! Reccomend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	2	English		4	4	3	4	485030	3/6/12	extremely knowledgeable of course material, has a strong idea of what direction students should take, follow guidelines and you'll get a good grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	1	English		3	3	3	4	485030	5/10/10	Very sarcastic. Do your work and he'll like you, you really dont need to be a great writer to get an A, just follow the way he wants the paper done and your solid. Hes not very helpful but the class is simple, you write three long papers. Thats it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Connor	3.0	0	English		3	2	2	1	485030	1/6/05	He was horrible. He made us do a ton of work and I don't think I got anyhting out of it. The only nice thing is he is lenient on grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering		2	4	4	4	902288	4/10/13	He is a nice guy who will help if you ask. He is always in his office. Tests and quizs are hard but if you understand the homework you are did then you will pass his tests no problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering	608	2	5	4	3	902288	2/3/09	Not doubt, he's weird but he is an awesome teacher. He lives in his office so you can always find him for help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	902288	10/23/07	in thi class.. i you wana learn. go to class every day. He gives good notes. def.. recomended for people that wana learn. he is a lil anal.. but great professor. its al lot to learn from him..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering	360	3	5	5	4	902288	10/19/06	This man rocks. He has a doctorate, so you know he knows his****. He's always willing to help, no matter how long it takes. His work can be somewhat tedious, but he's great teacher to have and to learn from. Don't hesitate to choose his courses, if you have the choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering	360	2	5	5	4	902288	1/26/10	Awesome guy! He does have his quirks, but you will learn a lot. The man lives in his office. I've left the building at 1200 and he was still there. Go to his office if you need help and he will break down so you understand it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	1	Engineering		1	3	3	2	902288	1/11/09	He's quite difficult. Very inflexible, assigns tons of homework, and gets bent out of shape over stupid things. He knows what he's teaching pretty well and you will learn if you're ready to break your back for him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Cooke	4.3	2	Engineering		2	5	3	3	902288	7/21/07	Plays favorites which was annoying. Odd sense of humor which was funny in a weird way. Very challenging tests which. Rediculous labs that took so many hours along with the large amount of hw.
Rochester Institute of Technology	E Cope	2.7	1	Languages		2	3	3	2	1187806	1/26/09	there was too much reading assignments for me to have enough time to work on my drafts. Plus you had to write reading responses for each reading. And she's very specific on what kind of folder to put your essay in, "so her son doesnt knock it over and spill everything". therefore i dropped the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	E Cope	2.7	0	Languages	227	1	2	2	3	1187806	10/23/08	She grades papers very odd. Makes listen to hour long podcast and write blog. Random quizes on dumb things. Majority of people in class dont like.
Rochester Institute of Technology	E Cope	2.7	1	Languages		2	3	3	2	1187806	1/26/09	I had her for winter quarter. She explained stuff well, but r 1st paper was a Retorical paper, based on a journal of a subject. I jus didnt like how 1st paper was so rush b4 break. + u get readings evry class tat u hav to write a reading response on Pubwiki. tere was a inclass essay after break. just 2 much hw, so i didnt have time to work on draft
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics	282	3	4	4	5	67398	2/27/12	Good Professor. Quizzes/Workshops are easy, but Tests are not. He make math interesting and has many opportunities for extra credit. I would recommend taking his class if it is open.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	67398	2/12/11	Project Based Calc II: Great guy, teaches well, lots of office hours. Workshops and exams are very difficult! (70% of grade = exams). Quizzes are normal difficulty. No project at the end. If you work hard, and show it, he will use your final exam grade as your letter grade if its better. Recommend for his teaching but the class is challenging!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	67398	12/3/09	He's very helpful when you have questions. Homework isn't bad when you know what your doing and the test are fairly simple except for the proofs. With a little studying you can easily get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		2	3	5	3	67398	4/21/09	Nice guy to start. Goes over material very slowly, but writes pretty challenging workshops and exams. I wouldn't mind having him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	67398	10/30/08	I really liked him, he taught very clearly and is a nice guy as well as a good professor. His tests are not too difficult if you grasp the information, although some of his workshops require knowledge beyond what is taught in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics	366	3	4	5	3	67398	11/6/07	Considering the somewhat dry topic, he managed to keep lectures interesting enough to attend. He's a great guy who's more than willing to help if you've got questions. His tests and assignments are fair. Put in a fair amount of study time, and it's hard not to do at least decently well in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics	331	3	5	4	3	67398	10/20/06	Excellent professor! Very helpful outside of class, and has a good sense of humor in class. Keeps everything up to date online, and makes homework due the day after the last class so people can ask questions about it. Very organized as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	4	67398	11/23/05	Really disliked this professor, his grading was awful, few things wrong in any area and your grade will suffer
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	67398	3/24/05	Coppenbarger is a good teacher. He explains things clearly and step-by-step. If you've got a question he'll answer it as best he can. He doesn't rush through problems like other professors, he'll take his time and ask for questions. The homework and the quizes/tests were fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	67398	4/27/04	The material is tough and challenging, but I found Dr. C to be very approachable and friendly. He was available when he said he would be, and prompt to answer any and all questions (in class, through email, office hours, etc.) Take notes & ask questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	5	67398	11/26/11	Great teacher, I really learned my stuff despite receiving my lowest grade ever. His homework is difficult but manageable, the projects are fun, the tests are BRUTAL. Nevertheless I highly recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics	282	3	4	4	4	67398	1/31/11	I've taken him for nearly 2 quarters now. Very clear and grades fairly. Exams are difficult but do-able with studying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67398	4/29/09	Probably the best teacher I've had. Reasonably easy to get an A if you work at it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	67398	2/3/09	One of the best math teachers I have had. Although the subject I find to be rather boring, he covers the material really well. Doesn't use the text book except for home work. Very accessible to ask for help and willing to answer questions in and out of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	1	Mathematics	366	2	3	3	1	67398	4/14/08	This is perhaps the most boring material ever but he covers the material thoroughly. He is very available and helpful, but often times thought I knew more than I did (my fault). Pretty rough grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics	331	4	5	5	5	67398	12/5/06	Excellent teacher. He does a good job explaining things during class, including things which he thinks the book doesn't explain well enough. He is also available outside of class if necessary, and is always willing to help you understand the subject better. He has a good sense of humor and knows how to keep the class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	2	67398	11/30/05	Good teacher. Sometimes it was hard to understand some topics, but he is willing to help. If you show improvement on certain topics on the final, he will boost your grade. Offers extra credit on tests and quizes (a few points). You have to do well on the homework. Answers questions and is available outside the classroom. Cares about the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	1	67398	8/12/05	This is probably one of the worst professors I've had. He was fairly straightfoward in class and on his quizzes and tests, but he was sometimes confusing in his office when I went for help. He didn't give much room for improvement if you messed up on a few things, so if you don't do every single thing perfect/close to it, your grade will suffer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	67398	10/21/04	best math professor i've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Coppenbarger	4.1	1	Mathematics		2	2	4	NULL	67398	4/24/03	The subject is tough and he gives good notes he's just not very helpful when it comes to understanding homework and his exams are horrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Cormier	5.0	2	Engineering	727	5	5	5	4	1535625	11/15/12	He is very helpful, easy going, approachable, never hesitates to clarify doubts, good grader, has lot of knowledge in advanced manufacturing systems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Cormier	5.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1535625	1/27/11	Probably the best teacher I have seen in my life. Easily approachable, very knowledgeable and a very gentle person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Cormier	5.0	2	Engineering	761	4	5	5	5	1535625	4/27/12	Great professor!! Take Him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	1	Communication		2	4	2	4	809470	11/11/12	Nice guy. Can be confusing. Test are difficult and questions can be extremely random. Easy grader on papers though. He is passionate about material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		3	5	2	2	809470	7/12/11	I have had Cos for many COM classes including Rhet Theory. He is a very nice man, and very funny, but his teaching can be difficult to deal with. His lectures are LONG and change subjects frequently, but he is very interesting to listen to. His grading is inconsistent. He usually grades papers fairly but test questions can be obscure and confusing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		3	2	2	5	809470	5/10/10	Cos is a really great guy but not my favorite teacher. Can be very unclear about tests. Questions are usually random and it's hard to study for them. Class has lots of guest professors so tests are pretty much the only problem. Class can be easy 2 papers and 3 tests, lots of reading and it's usually easy to succeed without doing it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		2	2	1	1	809470	11/18/09	Ok so... final exam question: "Where did Professor Hickerson get her Ph.D.?" And he always includes questions like that on his tests. His lectures were too lofty, his explanations unclear, and his attitude was, if not aggressive when you questioned him about something, then very cocky. Do not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication	535	1	1	1	4	809470	3/9/09	By far the worst teacher I have ever had. First day he seemed like a descent guy then he would throw you under the bus for your speeches. I would never recommend an enemy to take his courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication	535	1	1	2	2	809470	3/9/09	Professor, spoke way above most people level. Was not nearly as educated as he thought he was. He figured tough grading made us work harder. I would never take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		3	4	4	3	809470	11/4/07	I think he is helpful and if you pay attention to his lectures, you will do fine in the class. I don't think he favors girls or guys either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		2	4	4	3	809470	8/11/07	LEERY ABOUT COURSE DUE TO PREVIOUS COMMENTS ON THIS WEBSITE. QUESTIONED INSTRUCTOR ABOUT THIS SITE, HAD NO EXPOSURE WITH IT. AFTER COMPLETION OF THIS COURSE (HUMAN COMMUNICATION)FOUND HIM ENGAGING WITH STUDENTS DISCUSSION THREADS, HELPFUL,YET FIRM AND FAIR. AS OLDER STUDENT WITH MUCH COLLEGE EXPOSURE,RATE HIM IN UPPER ECHELON OF INSTRUCTORS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		3	1	1	5	809470	2/15/07	DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! Worst professor known to mankind. He is extremely vague. He isn't very intelligent either. The only positive thing is that he ends classes early at times. Very unhelpful. He is by far the worst professor in the comm department. Attendance is ridiculous. No leniency. He also flirts with girls, and tries to be cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	1	Communication		3	3	3	3	809470	2/15/06	eh
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		3	4	5	4	809470	10/27/11	Good teacher and a funny guy. All these other kids are just mad they got bad grades. If you have him for a class you will never be bored and will do well as long as you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		2	1	2	1	809470	1/25/11	Very cocky. Extremely vague in his lectures AND exams! Not helpful at all. I was lucky to even pass this class. Very inconsiderate toward disabled people. Avoiding this teacher is a MUST!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	1	Communication	535	2	3	2	2	809470	2/1/10	Is all over the place. I had him for Foundations of Communication, a basic introductory class. Gives extremely hard tests with material not covered by the reading or lecture, and admits to it. Some questions are not relevant at all. However, he is very nice and extremely approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	1	Communication		2	2	3	2	809470	11/18/09	GIVE THE BEAR SOME SPACE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication	480	1	1	1	2	809470	3/9/09	Professor Cos is the most difficult teacher I have taken at RIT. He is a cocky jerk who only helps you if you're a hot girl. His assignments are hard to understand and his exams are impossible to study for and you can expect nothing higher than a C. His test averages were in the 50s. I had to withdraw with a 62%. I thought it would be fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication	317	5	1	1	2	809470	2/5/09	I read a lot on this site about "the worst teacher I've ever had", and have never described a professor as such until now. Grant Cos loves the sound of his own voice, reads from the text in place of a lecture, avoids questions, flirts with the girls, and makes sad attempts to relate to young people. I learned NOTHING in his class. NOT A DAMN THING!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	1	Communication		4	3	2	4	809470	10/22/07	Prof is not that helpful, he is all over the place, doesn't have clear thought, true that he has preferences over girls.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		2	4	4	3	809470	8/7/07	Tells you exactly what you got wrong on your speeches so you know how to improve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		3	1	1	1	809470	1/31/07	he's not very helpful at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	0	Communication		2	2	2	2	809470	2/14/06	i hate him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grant Cos	2.5	2	Communication		4	5	4	4	809470	2/9/06	Fun class. Lecutures are not boring and neither are the speeches. Just do your speeches and you'll be fine. He is helpful. Usually only has 3 hours of class every week instead of 4.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Couderc	2.6	2	French		2	4	3	3	764853	11/12/11	VCouderc is a great French teacher! She's a pretty tough grader but she's very willing to help and you can re-do assignments. Also, she doesn't really have a strict late policy. It was a lot of work but worth it in the end. I would definitely recommend her as a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Couderc	2.6	2	French	101	1	4	4	4	764853	3/29/09	I loved having her as a teacher! Soo nice and very willing to help if you ask! She is a very tough grader, but only because she believes you have to be precise in order to learn. It was a fairly difficult class for beginning French, and there was a lot of homework, but practicing and repetetive work is necessary to learn a languag. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Couderc	2.6	0	French		5	1	3	5	764853	6/2/09	She was extremely rude to me, and abused the early alert system to berate me - she sent an "early" alert in week 10, and even though I was one of the most knowledgeable students in the class! She knows her stuff, but needs to be much more professional in her reactions to students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Couderc	2.6	0	French		4	1	1	5	764853	11/25/05	Treats students as though they're in high school. Rude if you have any sort of conflict with her; doesn't listen to reason and always insists that she is right for no other reason than that she is the teacher. She seems to be applying French grading standards to RIT, as well. Gave Cs to quite a few students who got As in Advanced, which is harder.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ellen Coyne	4.6	2	Mathematics	225	3	5	4	4	1186333	1/26/11	Ms. Coyne is such a sweet teacher!! She would come in an hour before tests just to help students with last minute reviewing. Definitely take her! Clear, helpful, fair, good looking. Take her if you can-she absolutely does her best to work with you and help you get the picture. She's unbelievably smart--she does aerospace engineering for the navy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ellen Coyne	4.6	2	Mathematics	319	5	4	5	3	1186333	1/9/09	Great professor, will make stats crystal clear for you no matter how little you know about it coming in. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ellen Coyne	4.6	2	Mathematics	319	4	4	4	3	1186333	10/13/08	Good professor. Tests are fairly easy if you go to class, do the homework and look over the notes she writes. However, she grades homework for correctness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ellen Coyne	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1186333	2/2/09	I absolutely LOVED this course. In high school I hated statistics and I came in knowing basically nothing. The way she explained it, it all clicked. You take a lot of notes, but if you go to class and take notes, she does examples and in-class group worksheets to better prepare the students for the quizzes and tests. I LOVED the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ellen Coyne	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	1186333	11/5/08	Excellent prof. Will go out of her way to help you learn the course material. You actually learn and understand stats with her. High recommended for stats.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology		5	5	5	1	287567	8/19/12	ONE OF THE BEST! I didn't want to take her course based on previous ratings, but once the course started I had no idea what everyone was talking about. EASY A! EVERYTHING is clear. You just have to read the syllabus before the course starts!! Work for the whole course is easy. All 10 wks of discussions can be knocked in an hour. GREAT Professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	3	1	2	2	287567	4/18/12	Worst professor I've ever had at RIT. I had her a couple years ago now, and she STILL stands out as the worst professor I've had, so much so that I felt it necessary to come back and leave this warning for the rest of you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	3	1	2	3	287567	8/9/11	She talks down to students and does not hesitate at the chance to embarrass anyone. Very little concrete material is actually covered. She goes for the wow factor and tries to entertain which really consists of her wasting an entire mandatory class showing pictures of prince alberts and ornate tattoos. You don't want to take a class with her, ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology		4	4	4	4	287567	6/12/11	She is not as bad as people have commented. This class is easy, just don't disagree with her, and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	2	1	1	4	287567	4/23/11	Run while you can! She is not a good teacher. She think she knows everything. She doesn't give out A's. All exams are from her CD and book. If you don't have them you fail the exam. Half of the grade is group work. She is bigoted, mean, not helpful at all, her schedule is confusing and doesn't sync with her due dates. DON'T TAKE A CLASS WITH HER.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	1	1	1	1	287567	1/26/11	DROP. HER. NOW.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	1	1	1	1	287567	1/4/11	Please refer to one of the grading rubric.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	1	1	1	4	287567	10/10/10	She is sincerely the most insane professor I have ever had. Insane amounts of work for a intro class. Grades are completely random and usually you get the same as everyone in the class regardless of what you do. I would advise against taking her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	1	Sociology	101	4	5	1	1	287567	2/3/10	Gives early alerts to those who leave after the 1st hour of class. Doesn't give straight answers, just refers you to mycourses over and over again. Majority of conversations end up talking about womens rights. Makes you buy HER book/ pointless CD and then rip pages out of it so its worthless to sell back. Take it with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	201	4	1	1	4	287567	10/30/09	I don't feel like I learned anything in this class. Whenever anyone in the class had a question she told us to refer to what was posted online. I don't think she knew what she was to be teaching. Her grading was pretty obnoxious too. She usually gave everyone the same grade on everything except tests that she didn't grade because they were online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	3	1	2	3	287567	7/9/12	Absolutely terrible. Had her for the online class and it was horrible. Nothing is explained clearly, including due dates. If you ask a question she'll shoot you down and embarrass you with a snippy comment. You don't learn anything because tests are word-for-word from the review guide. You'll pay $300 for the required (and quite useless) supplies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology	210	5	5	5	2	287567	2/20/12	Really great professor! Very interesting content and presentation....shows how sociology is relevant to our lives. Plus class is totally easy. Be prepared for something totally wild to happen each class! Fun times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	3	2	2	3	287567	6/22/11	She has very strong opinions but I personally liked her. The work is extremely easy. Just show up to class and get all the materials and you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	4	2	2	4	287567	5/30/11	Worst professor I have had to date at RIT. Due dates and expectations are not clear and she uses 20 different fonts in course outline for online course. Very confusing. I DO NOT recommend taking Sociology with this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology		5	5	5	5	287567	3/9/11	She is very blunt, but I personally loved her. Grades very fairly, extremely easy test!
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		1	1	1	2	287567	1/19/11	By far the worse teacher ever. I do the readings, attend class which nothing is ever taught during. I still fail the quiz's because here questions are so incomprehensible, I.e multiple choice questions with multiple answers depending on perspective. Worse ever. Do not take..... ever
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	1	1	1	3	287567	12/5/10	Worst professor. EVER. Seriously don't even consider it. If your views on life aren't hers you will do poorly. I also have a feeling she doesn't read the essays because the whole class gets the same grade. The bottom line, DO NOT TAKE HER. She is also very rude to students, and she rarely gives out A's. RUN
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	4	1	3	3	287567	8/14/10	Worst teacher ever. You need to be a teachest pet. Will NEVER give you a 100 on a written tests. You must have the same views as her to do well. Don't even think about asking her for extra credit or a grade boost. She told me "Only excelent students get A's." Group projects are a waste of time, you will never do well. Shes very inconciderate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	1	1	2	4	287567	12/1/09	Possibly the worst professor I have ever met. Along with that, definitely one of the worst people I have ever met. Started off the first class ever by saying "I'm not a nice person." Very rude, too much work for 4 credits and a level 101 class, on a huge power trip. No laptops in class, doesn't care if you take notes with it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	201	5	2	1	3	287567	10/22/09	Ok she is very entertaining and that is about it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	211	4	1	1	2	287567	10/15/09	Bottom line: She's crazy. Not helpful, completely ignorant to everyone. You will never know when you have an exam, so ASK (they're easy-MC and a few essay questions). Strict on attendance. She's ****, yells at the weak, and does not like sleepers. Don't EVER try to cheat, she will destroy you. Don't talk back. Bad as she is, she'll make you laugh
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		1	1	1	3	287567	5/7/09	Easily the worst professor I have ever had. Has no idea about the subject at hand. Class consists of talking about articles she randomly finds in the newspaper. I was really interested in taking this course when I registered for it, but now I regret it completely. She used Serravallo's syllabus but didn't stick to it all. Terrible, avoid her 100%.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		1	1	2	3	287567	2/24/09	Worst class ever! I don't even know where to start, she is extremely biased and only her opinion matters, we never took notes and don't expect to learn anything. You can only pass her tests if you buy the CD and the book that she wrote. If you expect to get an forget about it, getting a 90 or above on the written assignments is impossible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	3	1	1	3	287567	2/3/09	DON'T TAKE, She has no idea what she wants, constantly contradicting herself. If you ask for help or info she'll tell you it's online-IT'S NOT ONLINE! The class is total BS, at first it seemed like it would be alright but by the end of the quarter when everything is due it's just ridiculous, you don't have a clue what you're supposed to be doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	1	Sociology	101	4	2	3	3	287567	5/11/08	She's relatively closed minded. Takes no initiative to explain her position and foams at the mouth when you are against the grain. Understanding, but her beliefs and attitude can be irrational. Seems useless to go to class. I wouldn't take this class with her ever again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	2	1	1	1	287567	4/24/08	STOP RIGHT NOW AND DROP THE CLASS. DO NOT TAKE HER! Worst teacher I have had at RIT. Impossible. You can get an easy A but its the worst type of easy A ever. She's old and ridiculous. The class has little structure. You can stop reading these now and pick another class. Please learn from my huge mistake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology	101	5	3	5	4	287567	1/27/08	She's sooo easy! Definitely an easy A as she makes the quizzes very easy. Very interesting class as well! :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	5	2	2	3	287567	2/11/07	She is CRAZY! haha but in a very entertaining way. You'll laugh at least one point during class..for sure. Her class is the easiest class I have EVER taken, pretty much a guaranteed A from the start as long as you do the work. It stimulates your thinking about different topics and is interesting, but she definitely hasn't taught me anything new.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	120	2	1	1	1	287567	10/17/06	Vaque Questions, not helpful AT ALL with answering questions about topics
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		3	1	1	5	287567	2/6/06	She is by far 1 of the worst teachers I have ever had. unfair grader. Almost all projects are in groups, so if you can't work in groups DO NOT take the class. I ended up doing all of the work while my group members recieved the same individual grade as i did. tests r easy if you buy her lame CD (waste of money). That class wasted my money & my time
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	5	1	2	2	287567	6/19/09	She's alright, definitely not very helpful. She's not very clear on what she wants, and kinda leaves you with the feeling you have NO idea what to do. She also gives everyone the same grade on writing and debates. The only thing that really decides your grades is the quizzes. Honestly if you have an interest in the subject, pick another professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		5	1	1	3	287567	4/24/09	If you are interested in Sociology and possibly plan on a concentration of minor, go to another professor. Crawford is a waste of time and money. While she can lead some decent discussions, her demeanor is that of a mentally challenged chimp. She often pauses for 10-20 seconds, grasping for sophisticated vocabulary. Go to another professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	101	3	1	1	3	287567	2/3/09	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS...She makes you buy a pamphlet that costs $70 and a cd thats $15 that has 3mb of information on it. You fail the tests if you did not purchase the pamphlet and cd. Coincidentally, both of those materials were made by her. Tests are not based on anything learned in class. Turned out to be a big waste of time...
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	4	1	1	1	287567	5/19/08	I cant say that i actually learned any sociology in this class. She makes you buy an $80 book that she wrote so you are able to take the "tests". she is extremely closed minded and pretty much just preaches about how unfair life is. quite frankly i think she is loosing her mind and really doesnt have a clue about what she is talking about. If you w
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	210	4	1	1	3	287567	4/28/08	This professor is hopeless. She's losing her mind. Lectures and exams are completely unrelated. Very unorganized syllabus and unclear when giving directions. Text is mandatory for tests and coincidentally written by her. Very stubborn and gives little or no attention to individual students. Not very friendly and not willing to help you. AVOID HER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology	202	2	2	1	2	287567	4/18/08	Test questions are extremely vague and don't make sense as are requirements for pretty much everything else in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology	101	4	4	3	3	287567	11/5/07	A very fun teacher. Her class is entertaining to be in. She often puts you in groups for discussions and projects. Lots of presentations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	2	Sociology	101	4	5	4	5	287567	2/6/07	I must disagree with many of the other statements. Dr. Crawford's class has been my favorite here. You really explore how the different paradigms apply to all aspect of society. Her class has helped me to better understand the science of sociology and its importance. She is very kind and very humorous at times. I would suggest this class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		5	1	1	4	287567	10/27/05	She's a very opinionated individual who yells at you if you happen to disagree with her. Projects are easy and everyone gets the same grade regardless of their input into the project, it reminds me of 6th grade almost. Every time I walk into that class I sigh and think of how much money I am losing taking it...
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		4	1	2	2	287567	10/23/05	she takes class horribly, is not a fair grader, like on group projects she has us work online and requires us to submit all corespondence, but then grades people who do jack the same as the people who do all the work. she does not know our names and expects us to check her course website at all hours of the day one day before an 8 am class a kid posted something @ 3 am and she expected us to know it also she asks people to take stands based on her biased information and views contrary to hers are peanlized

Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		5	1	2	5	287567	8/24/05	She is out of her mind, and if you have a strong personality, she will hone in on your. She also gives you a flash application with the answers to every possible question on her tests. Easy class I have ever taken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	1	Sociology		4	3	2	5	287567	10/29/04	She doesn't spend the class time talking about sociology, more about the socioal aspects of Wegmans and the like. Take the class if you want a good laugh at your expense, but not if you are actually interested in learning. Tests and quizzes are not what you would expect. study hard.

Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		2	1	1	NULL	287567	5/6/04	Her tests make sure you read the book because the questions came with it... She had maybe 5 lectures all quarter... High School mentality for projects and assigments... Nobody in my class got an A.. The mean grade for the class was around 80...
Rochester Institute of Technology	De Lois Crawford	1.8	0	Sociology		3	1	1	NULL	287567	4/22/04	foundations of sociology with crawford is a nightmare
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Cripps	2.8	2	Design		3	5	4	4	1056929	11/23/11	Roy is a great teacher, he is very old school in how he teaches and in his approach. This guy has tons of talent! He maybe tough but if you don't have the skills he WILL call you on it. You will learn for sure one way or another.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Cripps	2.8	0	Design	123	2	1	1	3	1056929	1/10/08	He has a lot of Industrial Design experience and a great portfolio, but that doesn't make him good at clearly communicating with students. If you want to take a class with him I would recommend a morning class since he tires out easily (RIT did pull him out of retirement) and becomes cranky by the afternoon.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Cripps	2.8	0	Design	123	2	3	1	1	1056929	10/15/10	He takes attendance so seriously that NEVER, EVER miss his class. Good professor with a lot of experience. Nice personality, but not everyone is used to his style. Pretty much a "my way or high way" person. I found his class as a pain, even though I liked him personally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Cripps	2.8	2	Design	321	2	4	3	5	1056929	11/16/07	Graphic Viz teacher. Many complain that he may be unclear about handouts and assignments. If you have questions, ASK! He has had a LOT of experience and really knows what he's talking about. Check out his portfolio!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernice Cross	1.0	0	Design		3	1	1	4	1271461	10/28/09	Avoid at all cost she does not know what she is teaching, I took web design and she couldn't open dreamweaver, then commented they switched it around since adobe got it. A friend took a photoshop class with her and she was just as bad. If you are in a class and she shows up run, fast
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernice Cross	1.0	0	Design		5	1	1	4	1271461	4/13/09	Bernice Cross should not be allowed to teach. She is unclear, unfocused, and unintelligent. Every class was awkward and unplanned, and she has no idea what she is talking about. ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67399	1/31/07	I took him for data analysis 1 and it was rediculous. I don't even have trouble in math but his class was impossible to follow. It started out ok, but by the middle I was lost and so was he! He never seemed to know what was due and kept changing the format of the class. If your good at math, then you might be ok, if not avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67399	2/16/06	I am a senior here and I took this guy in my second to last quarter. I attended all but 2 classes and still have a very vague idea of what was taught. I don't normally post on these sites but I'd like to help my fellow "average at math" classmates and tell them to avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	67399	1/10/06	Wish I would have listened to everyones advice. This guy is by far the WORST teacher I've had at RIT. His notes and lectures are extrememly unclear, he refuses to use mycourses, so he randomly posts assignments without due dates on his own website. Probably going to withdraw from his class. do yourself a favor and DON'T take this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		5	1	1	1	67399	11/17/05	Don't ever take him! GEEEZ! His breath really stinks so I try my best to avoid asking him questions because he'll lean in and try to breathe in your face. Not only that, but he is totally unorganized and lost so many of my papers and forgot to give me a couple of instruction sheets so everything screwed up this quarter. I got an 'incomplete'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	67399	2/24/05	Horrible, avoid this professor at all acounts. Not helpful at all. I lost my interest in data analysis and statistics after taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	67399	10/20/04	Excel and minitab was an easy class and he wasnt at all boring. he made comments that are sarcastically funny, and anyone who thinks hes mean should seek psychiatric help. grow up babies
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		3	2	1	NULL	67399	11/5/03	Very hard to understand...gives you a packet of notes which dont help that much...projects are kinda tough and doesnt explain them well...tests are not too bad, but can be tricky....does not explain the material clearly....would not recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics	319	3	1	3	4	67399	11/14/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67399	1/17/06	If you're taking him for lab, it should be pretty easy as long as your taking a different teacher for data analysis. As for him teaching data analysis, stay away! When I walked into data II with him, I was so confused- not willing to review old material or do anything to help clarify his poor notes and instructions. I dropped his class asap!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67399	11/17/05	worst prof ive ever had. unclear...notes are confusing...entire class did poorly...class average for tests were always 60-70...do anything to avoid him
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67399	10/18/05	If this wasn't an online class I would have punched him in the face. STAY AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	4	67399	10/25/04	This is a cakewalk class. Said if you do the work, you will get an A. He was right, generally a helpful, but don't take his bluntness personally, thats just him. That is how he tries to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crystal	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67399	10/5/04	Horrible professor. If you ask for help he turns you away, and he is very rude with all his comments when grading. AVOID HIM!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology		5	4	5	4	751522	2/22/12	She is great teacher. The class is easy. She assigns a weekly homework that involves writing your opinions to a topic in the mycourses discussions. Quizzes are pretty hard but there is 3 attempts. You'll always get it all right on next attempt. I recommend you to take this teacher for Sociology!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology		5	5	5	2	751522	5/12/09	She's an awesome, flexible teacher. Her classes are highly recommended to take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology	210	4	5	5	5	751522	5/13/08	She has a good open-minded, to communicate and enjoy with our class. A lot of fun and talking about everything that taught us a lot. She gave us good chances with quizzes, fun presentation, and a final. I would recommend you to take her! :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology		4	5	5	4	751522	11/8/05	Cuculick has a very fun and vibrant way in the way she teaches, but very firm and blunt in a way where you couldn't possibly forget the information. She makes the information easy to apply and contemplate, thus increasing our interest in the way society works, and I applaud her--it's only her first year of teaching and I am in awe of her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology		5	5	5	5	751522	1/24/11	She's UBER awesome!!! You'll learn a lot what she teaches you. Take the class with her, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Cuculick	4.5	2	Sociology		4	5	5	5	751522	2/24/09	Cuculick is a very good teacher and she makes classes interesting. I recommend you to take her class if you have the chance! Oh, make sure you DO everything what she asked for. Beware of her final, it's extremely hard, so be sure you study for the final!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerry Curnutt	4.2	2	Business		5	5	5	5	562771	8/31/05	Great teacher, Very helpfull, quite intrestresting assignments, not very difficult, just read your text book carefully!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerry Curnutt	4.2	2	Business		2	5	5	5	562771	1/31/05	Very Helpful teacher. Very Intrested in what he taught, cared if you were having a problem. I would take his world of buisness or International buissness course if I got a chance.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerry Curnutt	4.2	2	Business		3	4	4	5	562771	2/26/05	WOW! This class had a ton of assignments to get done. If you have good time management/are a very disiplined student you will do fine in the class. The tests are not too hard as long as you study. I thought he was an excellent professor and very helpful so don't be afraid to ask for help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerry Curnutt	4.2	2	Business		3	5	4	2	562771	1/31/05	He is such an amazing professor. I learned a lot about the different diciplines in business. His tests are not very easy, but not very hard (short answer mostly). If you don't understand something, definitely go in for help. He grades easier if you put the effort into going to get help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages	103	2	4	3	3	1051739	4/20/10	If she doesnt like you then you are**** out of luck. She is always late and often expects you to teach yourself portions of each chapter. If you have a friend in the class it is 1000% times better. if your not interested in italian or her study abroad program, dont bother taking her class. It just ends up being endless amount of hw for nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages	500	2	4	3	4	1051739	2/19/09	Elisabetta is an interesting character. She assigns a minimal amount of homework for each class but class meets four times a week making the out-of-class work level substantial. I learned a ton of Italian in just one quarter though and she makes class interesting and engaging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages		3	5	4	4	1051739	12/2/08	Great teacher who is very knowledgable on Italian films and history. I learned a lot and the course made me watch more Italian films on my own. I improved greatly in the language with interesting content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages		4	5	5	3	1051739	3/19/08	She's the BEST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!!!! If u do ur homework which is not that much, u'll get an A and she would give u italian candies:))))) She's very helpful and a great person. She would give everyone a good grade:)))))
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages		2	5	5	3	1051739	3/10/08	She is just great!!! Extremely helpful, polite, understanding, etc.. Highly recommended!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages	500	5	5	4	4	1051739	11/8/07	Excellent teacher! Her class is a lot of work but you learn a lot! She gives lots of extra credit opportunities and is very helpful if you seek it. She wants everyone to do well, and will help you succeed if you put forth a true effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	1	Languages		1	3	3	4	1051739	2/1/10	Elisabetta knows what she is doing but doesn't help people she doesn't like and expects you to teach yourself most of the material. There are a LOT of tests and a LOT of homework. It is hard but A's are possible. Lately she has been a real jerk to all the students in class. But she IS the best professor you will find- it's just hard...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages		4	4	5	5	1051739	1/26/09	I like this teacher mainly because she strives to weed out those in the class who are not sincere about learning the language. You have a tutor available to you and she encourages study groups. Expect to work in her class. As long as you read the book and do your assignments, you honestly will learn a ton and will be speaking italian with ease!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages	102	2	5	4	4	1051739	5/18/08	best professor ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	0	Languages	101	2	2	2	5	1051739	3/18/08	Elisabetta is late for everything and partial to her own programs. She is very stuck in her teaching methods and not very flexible to student suggestions or extra help aside from her own..ie a tutor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta D'Amanda	4.1	2	Languages		2	5	4	5	1051739	3/5/08	Great teacher. A lot of work but is very willing to help and really wants you to do well in her class. Definitely will learn a lot in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Coromina	3.9	2	Spanish		5	4	4	4	474613	10/24/06	Very easy grading system, designed to give anyone who puts even some effort an A. Encourages conversation practice. Corrects your mistakes in a nice way that makes you feel comfortable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Coromina	3.9	0	Spanish		3	2	2	5	474613	2/21/05	She is hard to understand-- not as far as her accent, but as far as the basic clarity of her directions.. Overall I always felt uncomfortable in her class and since half the class wasn't even close to a true beginner it was a bad experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Coromina	3.9	2	Spanish		5	5	5	4	474613	10/19/04	Easy A. Focuses a lot on culture and history of hispanic countries and Spain. Briefly goes over grammar. Not a lot of practice in speaking. She's native Argentinian, so you'll get a lot of experience in listening.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Coromina	3.9	2	Spanish		4	5	4	5	474613	10/5/05	LOVE THIS TEACHER!!!! she's very sweet and understanding and will encourage you to make mistakes so she can correct you. she isn't terribly critical of people either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Coromina	3.9	2	Spanish		3	3	5	5	474613	11/20/04	mmmmm... what a hottie!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Cost	3.4	2	Not Specified		5	5	4	4	744482	2/22/13	He is a very quirky guy. His comments are randomly hilarious. He is very kind, do not be afraid to talk freely with him or to ask questions. In comparison, the other photo teachers are stricter but my peers did not grow as much as I did. He lets you experiment. He also informs you of current news in the photo world which I found to be very helpful!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Cost	3.4	2	Not Specified		4	4	3	3	744482	10/22/08	He is a good lecturer though he is nerdy. Sometimes, he makes hidden points in presentation
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Cost	3.4	1	Not Specified		4	3	3	3	744482	10/26/09	Interesting class..a bit random, one day talking about google another about who knows what, like all the books he has made, including one of pictures of himself. But he is nice to chat with, fun, positive. He made a book of our class from a video he took of us introducing ourselves, it's quite funny. I'm on the cover.. haha
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Cost	3.4	1	Not Specified		5	3	2	1	744482	10/14/08	Frank Cost is a pretty cool guy. I have to say he is very nerdy when it comes to gadgets like the pen that can play music. To me his class sorta doesn't make sence at times. One day he's talking about his trip to India, another day he actually has a powerpoint that you take notes on. Interesting dude though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffery Cougler	1.5	0	Graphic Arts		3	2	1	5	1638063	4/30/12	This class should be a piece of cake because it is a basics of photoshop class. Jeffrey Cougler is deaf and this class my class was all hearing. I appreciate the man's attempt to teach a hearing class.. However, there is miscommunication between his students. He is unclear of his grading and difficult to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	1	67465	11/15/12	Lecture notes could have been more detailed and online homework was irrelevant. However he was very approachable and willing/excited to help if you made the effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	2	Chemistry		2	4	4	1	67465	5/29/12	My thought after the 1st lecture -"what have I gotten myself into?". However, he provides multiple old tests as study guides. Make sure you really understand what's on them and an A is very achievable. There are also bonus points, so no excuses!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	0	Chemistry	312	2	2	1	1	67465	3/22/11	I don't know how he teaches biochem, but he is completely useless at teaching Chem Seps. How does this guy expect the class to do well on exams when he doesnt even know what hes doing. He should not be teaching this class and he grades extremely harsh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	2	Chemistry	740	3	4	5	4	67465	11/11/07	Dr. Craig is a very good professor. Class is extremely well organized and expectations are clear. He is very clear and interesting in his lectures. He is continually modifying his approaches to improve teaching effectiveness. If you take his biochem course, you will learn a LOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	1	Chemistry	502	2	4	2	1	67465	11/15/05	Not even God can save him from a decent score from me here. He's nice, but the exams are going to kill you, and he's usually not willing to give out points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	0	Chemistry	334	3	2	2	2	67465	10/26/12	Very unorganized as a professor and powerpoint slides are terrible. The slides have pictures and very little words so that it is difficult to go back and study for the tests. He is a nice guy, but didn't do well at teaching the material although he knows it well. Tests are easy if you study. Textbook was a waste of money; didn't use it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	0	Chemistry	312	3	1	2	1	67465	3/22/11	Really bad chem seps professor. He doesn't really understand the material and therefore does a horrible job presenting it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	3	67465	11/12/10	Dr Craig is awesome. He is the best professor in the Chem Department. He is very helpful and his expectations are VERY clear
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	3	67465	5/22/06	This guy is a moron. How he is married, I don't know. He is pretty helpful with telling u exactly what u want. Also, anyone who has to write something for him, don't plagiarize bc he has a program that tells him exactly who is!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Craig	3.2	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	NULL	67465	5/27/04	pretty good.. knows what he is talking about... CFC lecture is humorous
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Crawford	2.8	1	Computer Science	218	4	3	3	5	552569	5/19/06	Luckily I found the material easy (not to sound arrogant, but he was not great at explaining in depth). Hard to pay attention to, he doesnt seem happy to be there. Just reads the power points without explaining a lot (tho not always). But, he does seem like a cool guy and despite appearances, is willing to help you alot if you ask. I didnt mind him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Crawford	2.8	0	Computer Science	217	3	1	1	5	552569	1/11/05	Moves too slow and got pissed at me for using the Math class because he didn't teach it but assigned a rounding program... Drones on and on endlessly about coding style, but will take off points to ensure you don't get a 100%, even if you comment the living daylights out of your programs. AVOID HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Crawford	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	3	552569	2/1/05	Good guy & professor. This class was a breeze for me and I had no previous programming experience. ; )
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Croog	2.2	1	Political Science		1	2	3	4	623408	9/29/05	Unless you are really good at writing papers his grading will seem strict. Don't bother asking questions about what he expects from the papers because he will not give you a straight answer. Likes you to figure it out for yourself what he expects. Spent an hour one class going over rudimentary writing practices.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Croog	2.2	0	Political Science		1	3	1	4	623408	5/20/05	Good class. Good teacher. Incredibly hard. Very little progress reports. It's difficult to know how you're doing. Papers are graded really strict.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality		1	2	3	1	401985	2/2/11	Extremely boring; but an extremely nice guy. Lot of experience; but kind of outdated experience. His financial accounting class is absolute torture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	0	Hospitality		2	2	2	3	401985	5/18/10	He has a lot of experience and he shares it with the class. The only problem is that is hard to pay attention to anything he says. Like everyone else says, he is extremely boring!!! His exams are quite hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality	200	3	2	4	1	401985	10/27/09	It is a boring class and its hard to stay awake and listen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	2	Hospitality	200	4	4	4	4	401985	10/23/07	Class is boring. Crumb is very knowledgable but can put you to sleep. Dont wait till the night before the test to study. The tests are tricky. I recommend this class only b/c it is very informative- good starter class for HSM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	0	Hospitality		5	1	3	5	401985	11/17/05	Unfortunately i have taken ALL of his classes and they are all the same BORING. If you can manage to stay awake and listen his assignments will be a breeze.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	0	Hospitality		1	1	1	1	401985	8/31/05	The man is boring... he is a nice guy but boring. His tests suck but he never changes the format so the more classes you have with him the more predictible he is. Read, read, read to understand what is going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality		4	3	3	NULL	401985	5/8/04	I've had over 5 classes with him and gotten an A in all of them. To do well in his classes pay attention to his lectures (though sometimes boring) and be active in discussions. Test sometimes are tricky but not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	0	Hospitality		1	3	1	NULL	401985	5/4/04	You will have to read all the stuff he gives you all the time. I have a 3.5 GPA and this man is the hardirs guy I took in my life
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	0	Hospitality		2	1	1	2	401985	8/29/10	Mr. Crumb is like everyone has said, BORING! A textbook is not necessary for most of his classes, but because it's hard to stay away, you might be better off with the text. Attend class and take notes... His exams are very tricky, and he doesn't allow you to keep them (sucks).
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality	622	3	3	3	2	401985	11/19/09	He is kind but he just tell us to read textbook. it was hard that we just have to study with textbook for the final without study guide.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality	200	2	3	2	3	401985	10/26/07	Class is pretty boring...i didn't feel like i actually had to purchase the textbook. Crumb is nice....you just want to get up and scream about halfway through class because its so torturous!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	2	Hospitality		4	5	3	5	401985	5/6/06	Professor Crumb is great! I like how he brings in is field knowledge into the classroom. His tests are pretty tricky, but if you do everything else you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	2	Hospitality		4	4	3	5	401985	11/14/05	Crumb can be a little boring but you learn alot if you pay attention. His workload is pretty easy and he doesnt grade very hard. I recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Crumb	2.5	1	Hospitality		4	3	2	NULL	401985	5/19/04	It is a regular Crumb class...the work is bs and the test suck! However, he is very lenient and you can hand the work from week 1 in during week 10.

Treates us like highschoolers yet expects us to write like English majors. Contemplates everything and is open to nothing.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Czernikowski	4.0	2	Engineering		3	5	4	1	869326	7/28/06	Great professor. Explained a hard subject I didn't really care about very well so much so that I loved it. Very helpful. More professors should be like this...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Czernikowski	4.0	2	Engineering		2	4	3	2	869326	7/27/06	He's pretty set in his ways so at times he's not very flexible about what he wants in assignments, but he cares about his students and will spend the time explaining things to you if you go to him for help. He grades fairly and tries to make class material interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	362870	5/17/11	She is very rude and has her favorites who she helps through the entire class while ignoring everyone else. Lectures are extremely boring so stay away from taking this class at 8am. Literally kicks you out of class to make room for the next class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	362870	4/3/11	She can very rude sometimes. Try to stay on her good side. Lots of workload for this class. Also, her lectures are SO boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	5	362870	2/2/11	She tries to keep things interesting,but she REFUSES to clarify anything or answer ANY questions in class. I am an A student and I understand what she says, but sometimes I need clarification and she REFUSES to give it unless you go to office hours. Leaves RIGHT when class is over and won't stay after to help. Doesn't teach what is on the HW.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	362870	1/25/11	She's just rude. She bores me to death in classes. I just don't like her. Ridiculous workload for one class. Two projects, four exams, and few quizzes. Hated her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	362870	11/4/10	Mrs. Daggar is awesome! Attendance is mandatory to do well and tests can be difficult. Everything is done by computer, which can sometimes gets annoying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics	102	4	4	4	1	362870	11/4/08	great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics	320	4	4	3	2	362870	3/10/08	Great Prof. Makes Data II Easy, simple and worry free!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	362870	11/16/06	Very good teacher and always willing to help. She jokes around when you make mistakes but not in a mean way. Tests are ok as long as you understand the material. Her teaching methods are very easy to follow. Take her classes if you have the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	2	362870	3/31/06	She's a good teacher but has the tendancy to rush through certain topics that prove to be crucial in the end. Can be very rude at times and thinks her class is your life. However, she knows her stuff and you will do well if u do the work and pay attention
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	362870	3/1/06	good teacher very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	362870	5/8/11	Great teacher! Really knows her stuff and really wants everyone to learn. If you dont get a good grade in this class you diddnt do the work. 2 hour class 3 times a week. First hour is lecture second hour is daily assignment. There is also a weekly assignment every week and two test then the final. Great class and great professor!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	362870	2/2/11	She is extremely rude; and only cares about getting through her ridiculously boring lectures. Stay far away...She thinks her class will be your life for 10 weeks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	362870	1/27/11	Fisrt of all DAGGAR I LOVE YOU. I had this class at 8 am and there is nothing worse for me than to be awake at this time. But this lady made it so interesting that I was the most awake in there than in any of my classes. Best experience of my life at RIT. Loved her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	1	362870	11/23/10	She can be very rude sometimes, she would just brush you off if she feels like it. Very boring. She puts me to sleep everytime I go to her classes. But hey, that's data analysis 1 for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	2	362870	5/20/10	I personally don't like her because she treats the class like high school. it really bothered me. if you like having a teacher up yours all the time, then she's for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	3	362870	10/15/08	as other ratings say, you do learn alot in this class. Its sometimes hard to ask her questions though. On her good days, she's very nice. On her bad days, she's very rude, and brushes you off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	362870	12/4/06	Great teacher. Kinda anal about assignments but she's a fair grader. I'd recommend her cuz you actually learn in the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	362870	2/28/06	Very clear, moderately easy, just like high school style teaching. You better not talk in that class...but she's really nice and fun to joke with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	362870	2/15/06	shes the bomb
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	362870	2/3/06	I love Mrs. Daggar. I only wish that every math class I had growing up had her as a teacher. I hate math, and am not very good at it, but this is the first time since I can remember that I have actually enjoyed a math class with her. She makes it easy to understand and straightforward. I would also recommend her for deaf students. Make an effort!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	362870	11/9/05	Not the easiest class, but not very hard. She is a great teacher and explains everything very well. Stuff is not hard if you study. Very enjoyable teacher, will take her again if able.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	362870	8/28/05	Easy to learn from! Definatly recomment. I suck at math and I acutally got an A in her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	362870	3/15/05	Very good Professor. She reminds me of a high school teacher the way she teaches. If you want an A, she makes you work for it, but you will learn a lot in her class!!! Strongly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	362870	11/20/04	i can't think of anything funny to say here. she's just a wonderful lady!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	362870	2/9/06	Professor Daggar is by far the best math teacher I've ever had. She's will go out of her way to make sure you understand the material, and is very friendly. Show up for her office hour and she'll be so thrilled, you'll get better grades, just for getting to know her. Definetly take a class with her if you have the chance. I wish I could take more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	362870	11/14/05	easy as long as you pay attention and do hw...even if you don't do hw you can still get through

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	5	362870	8/17/05	She always said that she will answer your questions,but she never had time,as she said you have questions, get a tutor.This lady was going to give out 5 quizzes and drop the lowest grade,unfortunately for us,she only took three quizzes and never dropped the lowest grade. She's stubborn,can never try to understand and will never teach a good class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	362870	3/1/05	She great. I liked her teaching style, and she is willing to hear your arguments if you think she graded unfairly. Take her course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	362870	11/11/04	Mrs. Daggar used to be an elementary school math teacher. Wrangling screaming, sticky, hyperactive 7-year olds apparently translated well to doing the same for college freshmen. If she can't teach you, then you are not trying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		1	4	3	1	362870	10/19/04	OO man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Daggar	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	NULL	362870	5/4/04	She was an awesome teacher, i plan on taking her classes again. She explains everything clearly and makes sure everyone understands. Definetly a wonderful person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta Damanda	3.8	1	Languages		3	3	2	5	1051744	6/25/10	She seems really nice at first, and for the most part she is, but she chooses favorites and makes no attempt to hide it. If she likes you, you can float through the class, if not, watch out! She also likes to assign lots of work that can get hard to keep track of.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elisabetta Damanda	3.8	2	Languages	500	4	5	4	4	1051744	11/8/07	Excellent teacher! Her class is a lot of work but you learn a lot! She gives lots of extra credit opportunities and is very helpful if you seek it. She wants everyone to do well, and will help you succeed if you put forth a true effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tuhin Das	4.8	2	Engineering	359	3	5	5	4	1126922	5/20/10	I had Dr. Das for dynamics. His lectures were very clear and thorough. He had a good balance of theory and example problems. I felt that he was slightly uncomfortable teaching in front of the class, but his lectures were still really good. He is even more helpful in person, I would definitely recommend going to office hours if you need help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tuhin Das	4.8	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	1126922	12/1/08	Perhaps the best engineering science professor in the whole department. Had him for Statics and understood everything he discussed. He is very clear and will do anything to get you to succeed. Has office hours, but encourages students to visit him whenever they require help. If you can , take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tuhin Das	4.8	2	Engineering	359	5	4	4	3	1126922	7/20/09	He is a great guy. His lectures are kind of boring, but he is very thoughrough. He gives quizzes that are basically one of the example problems. His teaching skills are a little lacking, but definitely go to his office hours. I think he may get nervous in class, he teaches much better in a one-on-one setting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tuhin Das	4.8	2	Engineering	347	4	5	5	4	1126922	10/23/08	Great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Davidhazy	4.6	2	Imaging Science	401	4	5	5	5	34352	5/18/09	Have had for multiple imaging courses over the years. Absolute genius in the photography world. Can "reinvent the wheel" each class, but will always teach you something new and relevant. Grading is very straight forward and easy, just enough is expected of you to complete the course. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Davidhazy	4.6	2	Imaging Science		2	5	3	5	34352	5/28/08	This class was very informative for learning some of the tips and tricks of traditional photography. A very fun class!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Davidhazy	4.6	2	Imaging Science		4	4	3	4	34352	4/2/08	The class is fairly easy if you follow the lectures. Sometimes the professor comments can be a little disjointed, but once you are used to this he is a very entertaining instructor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Davidhazy	4.6	2	Imaging Science		4	5	4	5	34352	3/25/08	High speed: Interesting class. Not just memorization, but problem solving at it's finest. You'll come out with some great images - especially of bullets. If you like thinking out of the box and getting at different ways to solve a photographic situation, you'll love this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Davidhazy	4.6	2	Imaging Science		2	5	5	5	34352	11/8/06	I have 4 univversity degrees and have never found anyone by comparison who was even fit to shine his shoes.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Eddie Davis	1.8	0	Design		4	2	2	3	928025	12/4/06	He makes you guess what he's looking for, and you will not get a review of your work until it's already been submitted for a long time. His portfolio is not impressive for his teaching level, and he is not very helpful. Aim to take another design professor for this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eddie Davis	1.8	0	Design		2	2	2	2	928025	12/11/06	not helpful. It seems like no matter what you do for this guy, it's wrong. His expectations are slightly unreasonable in the mere ten weeks we have to do these assignments. I was up all night once a week each quarter working on projects for his class, and almost nearly failed anyway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science	313	4	4	4	3	66045	3/3/13	I like the guy, funny and laid back. not too hard but you must put in effort. Never hands back the class work or quizzes though. Easy to appraoch out of class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science		5	5	5	4	66045	10/29/12	I love this teacher. Clear notes on the board, more lecture than other teachers, given the physics workshop style. Friendly office hours, basic quizzes. If you're on top of the material, review every few days, you should do well. But he is picky on the tests. Write everything out, UNITS, and all vectors, E field stuff written CORRECTLY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science	312	3	4	4	5	66045	11/22/11	He is a very helpful, enthusiastic teacher. He is willing to help if you ask for it. He pushes you hard, but it is not impossible if you work at it. He gets mad if students do not participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science	315	2	4	3	5	66045	5/22/10	Had for Modern II. He's an alright teacher, decent at explaining things. It really benefits to read textbook before lectures. Tests are hard, but doable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science	313	2	3	4	4	66045	11/13/08	Good teacher... quite funny. Likes to use funky words. Lectures on and on, but lab is fun cause they're super easy and u basically have 20 min to kill. Harsh grader, but questions are straight from lecture or webassign (which is straight from textbook). Take his class, if ur smarter than the avg Joe the Student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science		2	3	2	4	66045	3/4/08	Davis has a hard time realizing that not everyone in his class can understand physics at the highest level of understanding. He refuses to simplify the lesson, he'll just repeatedly rephrase his complicated version. His test questions rely HEAVILY on concepts, however the WebAssign is almost all formula-use and is simple. He's decent, but be wary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science		3	3	3	2	66045	1/21/08	I had him for University Physics I and i thought he seemed very condescending what he talked or even just looked at you. His labs are ridiculous and take hours while simultaneously teaching you nothing. The web assign takes a while but is understandable. If you approach him he will help outside class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	0	Science		1	1	1	1	66045	1/15/07	A very poor professor. He is a harsh grader and is ineffective at teaching. He does not give you equations for his tests. Unfortunately, he may perhaps be the best of the physics department. The textbook is worthless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science		2	4	2	4	66045	7/11/06	very different way of teaching which made it difficult to learn. Was willing to help but did not worry about students performance. Be happy with a C or D.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science		3	4	4	NULL	66045	9/10/03	Kind of a weird guy. Want to help you out though. Good teacher, knows the info.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science	313	2	5	5	3	66045	11/16/12	Dr. Davis is the best physics teacher I have ever had. His notes are clear, and concise. He shows an active interest in his classes, and is more than happy to answer any questions you may have. His class is not easy, but if you show an interest he will be more than happy to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science		1	3	3	4	66045	2/23/12	Difficult professor for Modern Physics(1) if you're not 100% sure on the material. Tests are difficult but not impossible. Draws heavily from the textbook. Work through any problem he mentions during lectures until you can do it in your sleep. He's smart, but assumes the class has a firm mastery of the material. Study hard and you'll pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science		2	2	3	3	66045	10/11/11	He's an okay teacher. He can take on a belittling tone while he teaches which makes you feel less comfortable asking questions. He gets really annoyed when people don't participate in class. He often tries to reassure himself that he's doing his job well by "talking through the problem". Be cautious about taking his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science		2	4	4	3	66045	6/13/09	Great professor overall. Fairly tough grader...you have to have a thorough understanding of the material (including derivations) to pass tests. Weekly quizzes are very conceptual. The final is also mostly conceptual questions. Lectures are very clear and detailed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	0	Science		2	1	2	4	66045	10/15/08	Horrible Teacher. Actually advised the TA to not help us with in class assignments. Will try to make you feel stupid if you go to him for help during office hours. I would never take another class with him and will try my best to make sure my friends don't either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science		2	5	3	4	66045	2/7/08	tough professor, you have to know your concepts and how to apply them..also memorize equations. do NOT take his class if you're dumb or slightly slow..he'l anihilate you. if you like physics and are smart, you'll like him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	1	Science	312	2	2	3	3	66045	5/1/07	A fairly difficult teacher. Learned most of the material on my own. He briefly goes over the new subject then gives you worksheets to do. Doesn't give any time to actually let you understand what you are doing. Tests were challenging, though not impossible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracy Davis	3.5	2	Science		2	5	4	3	66045	1/12/07	Good professor, one of the few in the department. You'll learn with this guy. Hard to get A's. B is more typical. Quizzes are harder than tests.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Day	4.0	2	Engineering	415	5	5	4	4	983966	4/28/07	Day is a great teacher. Very fun but you will learn the material. He isn't the brightest professor in the department but at least I enjoyed attending class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Deangelis	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	752929	11/11/05	amazing teacher! i dont think i ever fell asleep, (thats a good thing by the way). tests were fair if you studied and as long you work. make sure you know what your doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Defibaugh	4.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	1562821	1/9/12	good teacher, tough grader. has all the old school photo tricks up his sleeve, you just have to ask, he has most of the answers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Defibaugh	4.3	2	Fine Arts		4	5	3	3	1562821	4/14/11	He's fun and interesting and likes the out of the ordinary. Not too easy of a teacher but not hard at all. He's hilarious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denis Defibaugh	4.3	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	1562821	8/15/11	Easy grader as long as you don't drop the ball too much. If you meet his requirements you will get a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Daehn	3.8	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	4	690578	4/27/06	He is a good guy, but tends to lack some professorship skills. He has more going on to him than the class and the students in it. Turned in the min submission for Project 1 a month ago, and the final sub a week ago, still haven't recieved grade for either yet. You should know/be comfortatable with CS material before taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Daehn	3.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	690578	3/15/06	Great guyask him to tell you about the time a teacher told him to **** off
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Dalaal	4.1	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	651774	7/26/06	She runs a tough class, but she's a great teacher. If you need extra help with what she's looking for to improve your grade, she'll work with you and help you. Expect to talk a LOT, but she will definitely improve your speaking skills a ton and you'll get a much better hang of the language than if you didn't take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Dalaal	4.1	2	Languages		1	5	5	5	651774	8/30/05	Hard class, but if you put in the work she is a GREAT teacher. She made learning fun, and shes hilarious
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Dalaal	4.1	2	Languages		1	4	3	5	651774	10/16/05	She's a tough little lady and strict which you will later get complimented on your japanese speaking skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Dalaal	4.1	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	651774	8/12/05	She is good. She works you hard but by the end you have excellent dialogue skills. She's into making you make up your own dialogues and you get to talk ALOT. Expect homework most every night (dialogue practice or workbook). She's always really helpful though. This is not an easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wendy Dannels	5.0	2	Engineering	890	2	5	5	5	1569426	4/27/11	I had taken three different courses each quarters and I had her in my each quarter. She may be pain in neck because she had very high expectation from students. If you tried to challenge her, she will stomp you like ant. However, she was very good teacher as long as you work with her and she will work you!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Meredith Davenport	4.0	2	Photojournalism		2	4	4	5	1485699	1/9/12	Mere is the best HANDS DOWN, she is a beyond excellent PA 1, 2 & 3 professor. She can be tough but it only makes you better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Meredith Davenport	4.0	2	Photojournalism		2	5	4	4	1485699	1/31/11	She knows what she's doing and what she's talking about for sure. If you put effort and thought into your projects you will be fine, but if you try and slack off and cut corners she will be the first to know. Tries hard to help all her students. Definitely recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Meredith Davenport	4.0	2	Photojournalism		3	5	4	5	1485699	5/22/11	Great professor, especially for her first year. She has a ton of experience in the field and is incredibly helpful if you ask for it. If your work is only ok you'll only get B's or even C's every time, so you have to really work for the A's, but in photography, what employer would settle for something that's not your best?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dean  Davis	5.0	2	Music		5	5	5	4	1788616	3/16/13	Very helpful in lessons. Ensures material is of appropriate difficulty. Gives very helpful feedback. Does not expect a lot of work. Some lessons you play a lot and other lessons you sit around and talk about anything the entire time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dean  Davis	5.0	2	Music		5	5	5	5	1788616	1/2/13	Excellent band director. Very easy-going. Often lets students out early. Picks music at an appropriate difficulty level to the students' ability. Very nice, friendly guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stacey Davis	4.6	2	Science		5	5	4	4	66046	5/17/12	Stacey is awesome. She will help you with anything and make sure that you get an A. I wish she taught the actual course and not just the lab section!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stacey Davis	4.6	2	Science	884	5	5	5	5	66046	10/12/06	Stacey is a great and patient teacher. I never regretted taking her class. It was very challenging to me but she made herself more available and was willing to help me with my academics whenever feel sucked. She is worth every freshman's attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stacey Davis	4.6	2	Science	231	5	5	5	2	66046	11/7/08	Kinda hard to take seriously the first few weeks if you're not expecting her type of personality. Would make a great 1st-2nd grade teacher. Once you get past that, and humor her a bit, she's a fine teacher. Knows a lot about her subject, and is very willing to impart that knowledge onto you.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Luane Davis-Haggerty	4.1	1	Theater	101	2	2	3	2	1409744	10/29/10	hard teacher but very nice lady.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luane Davis-Haggerty	4.1	2	Theater		1	5	5	5	1409744	3/21/10	The best acting teacher in the theater department. Audition for her plays!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luane Davis-Haggerty	4.1	2	Theater		1	4	4	4	1409744	9/18/10	She's pretty tough, but excellent teacher. She also teaches performing arts, too. Love her! Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luane Davis-Haggerty	4.1	2	Theater		2	5	5	5	1409744	2/18/10	Tough acting teacher, she's so sweet, and pushes you into a better actor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	953812	4/27/08	She is very good for anyone who is not strong with math. I am an Advertising Major and I think that I can get at least a B in her class with some work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	0	Mathematics	204	3	1	1	3	953812	11/19/07	Let's just say this might of been one of the worst teachers I ever had in my years in school. She constantly corrects herself or we have to correct her. Her quizzes and her tests are completely different. I received A's and B's in all my other classes. She just can't teach and half the time the class is so freaking boring. Avoid her at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	2	Mathematics	204	3	4	3	2	953812	10/30/07	Professor assigns a reasonable amount of homework just to make us understand the material. But the lectures are sometimes difficult to follow and i had to seek help outside of class to gain a better understanding of the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	2	Mathematics	204	3	5	5	5	953812	3/23/08	She explained clearly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	1	Mathematics	170	2	2	3	1	953812	11/6/07	Doesn't explain things well, generally boring teacher. Concepts are poorly communicated, had to spend a lot of time using the book to learn. Homework is assigned, but she only takes up 3-4 assignments all quarter... Those are announced on syllabus. Likes to teach new material on the day of tests, even though test doesn't have said material on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Dean	3.4	2	Mathematics	204	3	4	4	2	953812	1/29/07	Judy Dean is not a bad teacher, she's nice. She assigns reasonable amounts of homework. Judy sometimes can be kind of weird; she was 15 minutes late to class the week after vacation, and told us that it was because her watch was set to Texas time, even though Texas time is an hour BEFORE us. Hmm... suspicious?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Deaver	2.7	2	Film	263	3	4	5	1	1476542	12/6/11	Had Bob for Single Frame and he was so laid back and nice. He's helpful and explains assignments a lot before you have to do them. The last 30 minutes of this class is boring, he kills time but he is easygoing and you learn a lot. You get what you put into this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Deaver	2.7	0	Film		5	2	1	3	1476542	9/14/10	Does not understand how to use Maya. Asks TA for answers to most questions. AVOID. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Deaver	2.7	0	Film		4	1	3	3	1476542	4/16/11	A really nice and well-meaning guy. He knows his stuff but isn't the best at teaching it. Give him a few more years here and he'll improve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrienne Decker	1.5	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	5	1630255	11/13/12	She rambles quite a bit when lecturing. Her assignments almost always have typos and contradictory instructions. The class wasn't very difficult because I had programming experience going into the class, but kids who didn't struggled.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrienne Decker	1.5	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	1630255	1/30/12	Just terrible. Taught about one thing (poorly, I might add), gave class work about another, gave homework about something else, and then gave tests that were primarily based on vocab we never learned. She made us use Greenfoot instead of a real Java development tool, which led to us not learning the basics of using a programming interface.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrienne Decker	1.5	0	Computer Science	222	2	1	1	5	1630255	2/27/12	She can't seem to communicate what she wants from the students. Which means you'll get marked off on things that you didn't know she wanted you to do. Or that you did wrong because you misunderstood her incredibly vague directions. And she's both terrible and incredibly slow at getting any kind of information across to the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrienne Decker	1.5	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	3	1630255	10/24/11	Awful professor. Just transferred here this quarter. Teaches one thing during class then gives you a completely different assignment for homework. Unless you've already used AS3 before, you will need a lot of extra help. Upside: The class isn't unbearable, and she does grade projects fairly easy. But I definitely recommend not taking her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besty Dell	3.9	2	Engineering	101	5	4	3	3	815496	11/28/11	Very helpful to students. Such a nice lady and a wonderful teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besty Dell	3.9	0	Engineering	409	1	2	2	2	815496	3/10/07	no lab is good enough, expectations are ridiculous, very unorganized and inconsistent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besty Dell	3.9	2	Engineering	409	4	5	5	4	815496	3/14/07	good lab.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Besty Dell	3.9	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	815496	2/28/06	Great professor, really cares about her students. Helps students out well. Would recommend!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	281	5	5	4	5	516893	10/30/12	Dr. Dee is an extremely good teacher! He tells it like it is and no matter what, he will answer your question to the best of his abilities. One reason i really liked him was that even though he does answer your questions, he kind of levels you out and makes you realize that not all of the material will come naturally. Overall a great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	283	5	5	5	5	516893	2/27/12	Delorenzo was the best math teacher I have ever had. He was incredibly successful in profession life, and now teaches because he loves teaching. He will help you no matter what, and provides many opportunities to re-take and re-do test/work. If every teacher was like him the world would be a much smarter place
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	283	5	5	5	3	516893	11/9/11	The easiest professor ever. Practice tests and exams before every test/ exam. Explains really well. Best math professor, wish he taught me for every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	283	4	5	5	3	516893	6/8/10	Amazing professor. His background in engineering allows him to explain one of the most difficult calculus classes in relevant terms! Also, he gives out practice tests, handouts, and sometimes he even makes photocopies of his detailed notes for the class. Highly recommended if you like getting a good grade AND knowing the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	516893	11/27/09	Awesome teacher. He makes sure you know the material and the tests are super easy. He gives you 3-5 practice tests that are identical to the real one. He has no problem with you not being in class and will let you take tests on other days if you ask him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	516893	10/29/09	Great professor, teaches the material very well, and brings real world applications for math. Tests are easy, and never have ridiculously hard problems. homework is pretty easy and not a lot of it. Get him if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	282	4	4	4	4	516893	4/29/09	Good teacher. He's very understanding and lenient with the 2 absense math policy. His whole goal is that you understand everything by the end. Office hours sucked for me, but always willing to help. totally recommend! Easy grader too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	516893	2/4/09	Great teacher who wants you to learn the basic ideas of methods. Doesn't make you solve long, complicated problems. Tests are straightforward. Cares about you learning the material. Good grader. Easy A! Would take again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	5	516893	11/5/08	He's a bid hard to understand at times because he has a quiet and raspy voice. But he has an outstanding knowledge of the subject, is always willing to take time to help you understand things and makes sure you understand them. Easy tests (hint: just do the practice tests). Overall great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	3	3	516893	2/7/07	Great guy, very caring and helpful. Notes are sloppy and unclear but he grades very easy and will always try to explain stuff if you go for extra help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	1	516893	3/5/12	He gives MANY practice tests and practice quizzes, and these help tremendously with the actual tests and quizzes. I found I actually learned the material better from the book and the internet than from his lectures, but calculus is a very hard subject for me, so others may have an easier time learning from his lectures. His notes are helpful, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	123	4	5	5	4	516893	11/30/11	He is honestly the best mathematics teachers I've ever had, period. He is very forgiving and helpful. I HIGHLY recommend taking him for any calculus course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	283	5	5	5	5	516893	10/20/10	definitely the best calc teacher i had for all of my math courses at rit. gives practice tests that are almost exactly the same as his actual test. the homework he gave was also the easiest and shortest compared to any other teacher i have had, works very well outside of class, gives lots of examples, some theory and is a very approachable and nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	516893	1/25/10	I have never had a better calculus professor. He goes over everything you need for the exams, gives you great practice problems, and always makes sure you understand whatever is coming up on the exam. Take this professor if you can. You will not find a better one, guaranteed! -AL
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	516893	11/27/09	Awesome teacher. He makes sure you know the material and the tests are super easy. He gives you 3-5 practice tests that are identical to the real one. You wont find a better teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	2	516893	5/7/09	Sit in front- very quiet, gravelly voice. Can bring laptop to class, very few hw problems per assignment. I sat in back and never paid attention because I couldn't hear, and taught myself out of the book while I did homework. This is a fairly bad idea. But, nice guy. Can get A in class w/o doing work if you get 90 on both parts of final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	516893	3/9/09	Very effective teacher, really wants students to understand the material. He has an engineering background and always brings in real life engineering or science applications for somewhat abstract material, which helped a lot. His tests are very reasonable. I'd definitely take another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	516893	12/3/08	He was great and his class was pretty easy. if you wanna take a calc class he is your guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics	282	4	4	4	5	516893	3/13/07	Good guy. you need to bring your book because he references examples and graphs directly from it. Very few notes, if any, but its all in the book. Instead of wasting time rewriting the book on the board, he works examples and explains things. Fun, friendly guy, EASY TESTS (gives practice tests with almost the same questions beforehand). Helpful too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	516893	1/31/07	Dr. D is a really great guy. He knows a lot, and if you go and ask him for help outside of class, he will usually tell you exactly what to know for tests. He has an EE background, and so his teaching tends to gear towards EEs, which can be challenging. Overall, he's a nice guy, and does the job pretty well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	516893	1/15/07	He does not give you enough time to do tests, and fails to effectively explain concepts. His class is also extremely boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	5	2	4	516893	10/26/06	Really nice guy. Explanations at times went over a lot of people's heads, mine included, but just do the homework and you'll get the hang of it. He's always willing to talk one on one, and even though he can be hard to understand he will explain things until he is satisfied that kids get his drift.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	1	Mathematics		2	4	2	3	516893	8/11/06	Reads from the book. Very boring. Couldn't understand him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	516893	4/29/06	Amazing teacher, if you actually want to learn and aren't lazy. all you need to do is read the book, and then he expands on it during lecture. if you don't read the book his teaching style wont work for you. tests get harder as you go through the class, but if you do all the assigned hw its actually a sinch. nice guy too, if your awake
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	1	Mathematics	282	4	3	3	3	516893	2/6/06	Even if his teaching style isn't that great, this class is easy to do well in. He teaches directly out of the book, and gives practice exams. Just work the problems after the chapters in the books, and you'll have already done the tests beforehand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	5	516893	10/24/05	a really nice guy, although he needs to stop talking about EE, no one understands that stuff. easy grader, helpful if you ask, and he gives you practice exams. (do them and you will pass the exam, they are almost identical.) an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	5	516893	3/7/05	The people who had AP calc like me thought the class was very easy, everyone else did bad because he does not really teach the material, Dr. Dee is cool though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	5	516893	1/30/05	Nice guy. Easy tests and quizzes. Can be slightly unclear but all you have to do is approach him. Very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	516893	11/10/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	516893	10/22/06	He was the best teacher I had for Calc. at RIT. He noticed there was a large amount of different math backgrounds so he took the class slower. He offered many rewards to motivate you to learn the material. I would take any math class that he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	516893	5/4/06	This one's hard to call. Dr. Delorenzo teaches the material in the course straight out of the book, which will either work with you or not. The saving grace of the class was that the practice tests and quizes he handed out were near-identical to the real thing, making the real tests easier if you worked out the practice. Your mileage may vary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	5	516893	2/13/06	Worst teacher I have ever had. He couldn't teach if he tried and insists on talking about electrical engineering, which no one in the class is a major in. He doesn't explain things well at all, and I have resorted to trying to teach myself calculus with more success than listening to this old fool blabber on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	5	516893	1/10/06	horrible at explaining anything, even the most simple things. Makes numerous errors that are very important in learning the material and goes on random rants about things that don't pertain to the material that he just reads out of the book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	4	516893	5/19/05	This guy needs to stay in the EE dept. He knows that so well, but is really unable to leave it behind when teaching Calc 3. He is an easy grader, and an easy tester. He is very approachable, and willing to allow for make-ups. Dont be supprised if you are left wondering whats going during series though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Delorenzo	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	516893	3/7/05	Pretty good teacher, but somehow everyone seemed to do bad in his class. Explainations aren't always great, and he'll spend a lot of time on stuff you'll "use for the rest of your careers", but will really never see again unless you're an electrical engineer. Teaches directly out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Deluna	5.0	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	5	1688642	1/24/12	By far my favorite professor at RIT. He is a wealth of knowledge and has the passion and skill to impart that knowledge on his students. The subject matter and amount of information covered in each lecture can be overwhelming, however it is well worth the effort to pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Deminco	1.0	0	Engineering		2	1	1	5	1696219	10/11/12	Worst professor I've ever had. He hardly teaches anything. He gives vague assignments and then belittles the class for their work. He's impossible to contact (no office hours, doesn't reply to emails). All he does is give power points that are full of typos. Sometimes he just copies full pages from Wikipedia for power point slides....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	2	English		4	5	5	1	1189361	5/17/12	Class managed to be interesting and papers were fairly graded. Couldn't ask for anything more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	1	English	227	3	3	3	2	1189361	2/7/12	Had him for writing seminar, he knows his stuff. Pretty funny. Class is kind of boring though. 3 Essays and you choose your own topic. He's very skeptical and his class is based off of that, so it's pretty boring if you don't agree with him. Essays are not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	2	English	227	2	5	5	2	1189361	2/3/09	Excellent teacher; Classes were fun and interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	2	English	101	2	4	5	5	1189361	4/30/12	A great teacher! Class was never boring! A tough grader, but gives you a lot of outlines on what your essays should look like. Gives you readings that you don't need to read. I would highly recommend him, he will definitely change your ways of thinking!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	2	English	319	2	5	5	3	1189361	11/21/10	Had for Busting Myths. The class is basically on skepticism. Awesome, amazing, incredible class. Really changed my way of thinking. Requires a lot of reading and writing, but it's worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Desormeaux	4.5	2	English	227	3	4	5	4	1189361	1/28/09	Desoremeaux is without a doubt an opinionated guy, but he will challenge you each and ever day. He really is a fantastic teacher, and his feedback on graded work is very useful. The assigned papers are on enjoyable topics and our final project(analysis of music lyrics) was very entertaining. I hope to have him again and recommend him to others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	T Dexter	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	4	848084	5/14/06	This guy is G-O-D!!! His down to earth personality and fun lectures kept us coming to class. Highly recommended. No tests, HW, etc. Just show up and talk about anything, and he's the man to know it all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics	453	2	1	1	3	896083	11/17/10	useless, can barely understand her. Harsh grader, worst teacher I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	2	Economics	511	3	5	4	2	896083	11/16/09	She is a good professor. I like the way she draws diagrams and tells the class the steps involved. Very sincere....came to class even after having flu/cold. Definitely recommend her for micro
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	1	Economics		3	3	2	3	896083	5/4/09	Difficult accent, attempts to explain something by repeating simple concepts. Very unfair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics		4	1	2	2	896083	4/1/09	Horrible teacher, I really don't think she has a clue. She sticks to her rules, too- I had to miss an exam because my godfather died, and she would not allow me to make it up before or after the exam. I basically had to chose to go to his funeral or fail her class, and I wish I had just withdrawn and taken the course with someone else. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	2	Economics	511	3	5	4	4	896083	3/18/08	She is one of the best profs I have ever had at RIT. Her lectures got me so interested in economics that I have signed up for more classes with her in the coming quarters.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	2	Economics	511	3	5	5	3	896083	5/16/07	Great Professor. I enjoyed her Microeconomics class. She gives plenty of examples from real life. Makes students think and learn. Very helping...oh,yeah....she has an accent....but all except the morons follow her speech easily!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	2	Economics	101	5	5	4	3	896083	12/20/06	I do not agree with above comments. She is a very sincere teacher and takes all the efforts to see that students follow the subject well. I enjoyed her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics		2	1	1	1	896083	11/25/06	Teacher spoke very bad english. Class was boring. She didnt require attendence so everyone would teach the class to themselves and came to test days.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics		2	2	1	3	896083	10/21/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	2	Economics	101	3	5	4	3	896083	9/18/10	I like this professor. She gives plenty of practice questions. Her classes are interesting as she refers very often to real life examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics		2	1	1	1	896083	11/13/09	She is very hard to understand. It's not just her accent but her lack of understanding of the english language. She was very unhelpful and we didn't do much. We covered a 1/4 of the material other microecon classes covered in the same amount of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	1	Economics	211	4	4	2	1	896083	4/21/09	Gives pretty useful lectures, if very boring and drawn out. I was able to get refreshed on everything, but I wish it didn't take so long. The accent is bearable. She grades just like all the other microecon classes, and 10% for attendance/participation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics	511	1	1	1	5	896083	4/2/08	Hard to understand. Materials that showed up on tests were some what a surprise due to her not really going over it in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics	511	2	2	1	3	896083	2/5/08	her lecture have little or nothing to do with her quiz. If you want to get a A in her class read the book and skip class ,because her lecture will confuse the hell out of you. Just to give you of an example how bad her class was 1/2 of my class drop, and out of the 1/2 of the class that stay 1/2 of the class got a F before a grade curve of 10 point
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	1	Economics		4	3	3	3	896083	2/11/07	such a cute woman. not that great of a teacher, but if you pay attention and review her powerpoints online, you're pretty much guaranteed an A on every quiz. Study hard for the midterm and final, you'll be set. haha but it is true about the pizza and soda, and her accent can be hard to understand, and the class is really boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics		3	2	1	1	896083	12/7/06	if you're interested in pizza and soda, take the class....it's in all her examples.....she can't really speak well and it's really boring
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shatakshee Dhongde	2.5	0	Economics	511	1	1	1	1	896083	11/20/06	Professor cannot say anywords that are over five words, horrible to understand. you got out of the class what you put into the class. Did not go to any classes due to her not taking attendence, only showed up for the quizes and tests. She cannot teach, stay away from her classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos  Diaz	3.0	1	Packaging Science		5	3	3	4	1798534	2/19/13	Good teacher. Very nice and helpful. Tests covered material well. If you put the effort in he'll meet you halfway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	2	Environmental Science	206	4	5	5	2	1640932	2/13/13	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	2	Environmental Science		4	5	5	3	1640932	12/5/12	Best class this term.l
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	0	Environmental Science		4	1	2	1	1640932	10/18/12	Terrible lab environment. Constantly wastes valuable time during labs. Highly uninteresting. Makes homeworks on topics barely covered in lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	0	Environmental Science	202	3	1	2	4	1640932	11/28/11	This professor was an interim professor at RIT for 2011. She relied on her grad student to grade labs - he graded more harshly than she told us. Lecture was boring, everything was on her powerpoints online. Ambiguous test/quiz questions. Nice, but a very depressing and uninteresting take on environmental science.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	0	Environmental Science		1	1	2	1	1640932	11/17/11	She grads like it's a grad class and gives way to much work. If you can avoid her you really should.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	2	Environmental Science	206	4	5	3	2	1640932	1/24/13	Dr. DiCesare is really great. She's open to questions and is a great help. However, her lab quizzes can be very tricky, so study up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	2	Environmental Science		3	5	5	3	1640932	11/26/12	She made lab very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	0	Environmental Science		1	1	2	5	1640932	5/17/12	hard grader, terrible lectures that were uninteresting. assignments were graded by a grad student whose grading system was unknown and was very harsh. class treated like an advanced grad class. test questions ambiguous and some were very unclear. avoid her classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Dicesare	2.9	0	Environmental Science		2	1	2	5	1640932	11/27/11	Harsh grader. When you directly asked her a question about assignments she acted as though she was very lenient about grading them but she wasn't. Sometimes it seemed like she didn't know what to do so she would ask a question to the class and tell us to discuss it with our neighbor and then the other neighbor rather than a full class discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Deibel	2.3	0	Chemistry		2	2	1	1	1540523	1/20/13	Horrible in terms of being clear about lab procedures, does not explain reasons behind labs well. Very hard to understand labs and time consuming to do labs and reports. Report requirements are ridiculous. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER FOR INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS LAB!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Deibel	2.3	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	3	1540523	3/23/11	Isn't helpful at all. Expects you to know the intimacies of chemistry report writing, even when you are not a chem major. Will also point out that a chem major would be more than competent enough to make up for any failures on your part. Is very unhelpful, and very brusque in his comments. Don't bother to follow the lab rubric provided, you'll st
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Deibel	2.3	2	Chemistry		2	5	4	4	1540523	10/25/12	Keeps lab feeling relaxed and fun. If there is a problem with your data he will help you fix it and make sure you understand why it was wrong. The lab reports are demanding, but if you meet with him during office hrs, he will go through a draft of your report with you and help you finish it. Favorite lab teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	352001	6/16/05	Great teacher. Tries his best to help you learn, and it works.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		3	5	5	4	352001	2/20/05	A teacher that cares about his students. Fair grading system. Always looked forward to going to his class. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		5	5	5	4	352001	1/7/05	very funny take noon class its better
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		3	5	4	NULL	352001	2/11/04	He is a great professor overall! He will always help if you go to his office with specific questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		4	4	3	4	352001	2/21/05	Great teacher, I miss his class. Plus he's cute in a mid 30's Bill Clinton-esque kind of way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		5	4	4	4	352001	1/30/05	Great guy. Very funny and brightens up what can be dull topics. Easy grader. One of those guys whose class you would like to go to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willard Delavan	4.4	2	Economics		4	4	4	NULL	352001	5/19/04	good overall teacher, nice grading policies
Rochester Institute of Technology	Caroline Delong	3.1	2	Psychology		2	5	5	3	1448797	3/1/13	She is intelligent and knows what she is talking about. You can do well in her class but only if you show up, read the text, and complete all assignments. Overall i thought she was a good teacher if you try she will help you any way she can but if you dont try then dont expect her pity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Caroline Delong	3.1	0	Psychology	445	2	1	2	2	1448797	10/27/11	Extremely smug, makes paying attention difficult since half the things she said came off as self-absorbed and sometimes offensive. Exams were difficult and the excessively long projects were uncalled for in a liberal arts class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Caroline Delong	3.1	1	Psychology	443	1	2	3	2	1448797	6/18/10	I thought this class was going to be a breeze but Delong made everything unnecessarily difficult. She is a harsh grader and her exams are designed to see if you picked up on any obscurities in the class. Read the textbook I guess and you'll do OK. Lectures were pretty good but not enough to get through the class. Extra credit is offered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Caroline Delong	3.1	1	Psychology		3	2	3	4	1448797	11/26/11	Overall class was interesting itself however the tests were deceivingly difficult. Projects and concepts were intriguing but excessive for a minor's class, more appropriate for a major. Never touched the book and did decently well (not worth its money). If you're confident in your work, she will make you feel otherwise after detailed grading. :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Caroline Delong	3.1	2	Psychology		3	4	4	4	1448797	2/6/11	I thought this class was going to be easy just like all the other psych classes. But she gives a paper a project and some homework. She knows her stuff and teaches it well. As long as you take notes in class you dont need the book. Not hard, just a lot of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jen Delucia	2.5	1	Information Technology		2	2	3	2	1243249	10/2/09	She was not very active in class. We watched a lot of videos. It was a simple networking class, so we learned most of the material quickly. She did group projects instead of term papers, which was very nice. Sort of intimidating.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Demarco	4.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	1	1490460	5/20/12	Demarco makes this course bearable. The original course is boring and dry but the professor knows that so he tries his best to get through everything and teach a bit of life lesson on the side. He is willing to sit outside of class time and talk to you about what ever. In conclusion, Awful course-Awesome Professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Demarco	4.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	1	1490460	2/27/12	Incredibly boring class, but he knows it and will tell you exactly that on the first day. Seriously, prepare to be bored every class. Projects are straightforward and easy, midterm and final are short and simple. It's a very easy A. The class is horrible, but he's a real nice guy with plenty of stories and experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Demarco	4.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1490460	3/10/11	Get this guy for Needs Assessment if you can. He has a ton of experience in the field and will give you great advice on everything. He also acknowledges that the class is boring and will give you an A as long as your group finishes the (easy) projects. Midterm/Final are very easy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Demarco	4.4	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	1	1490460	3/5/12	This class is extremely boring and the teacher knows it which makes it a little easier to deal with. The content of the class is useless which can be self taught on a coop. The midterm and final are simple and the group projects are a joke. Teacher doesnt mind laptops which makes the 4 hours pass by quicker. All notes are posted on mycourses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Demarco	4.4	2	Information Technology		5	4	5	3	1490460	10/25/11	He tells you up front that the class is boring. But if you come to class, kind of listen, and do the 4 very easy group projects, you will almost definitely get an A. Bring a laptop to class to keep entertained, and pay minor attention to the lecture and you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Densmore	2.5	2	Engineering		4	4	5	4	662067	3/6/12	Good teacher. Yes he rambles on but its about the topic. Plastics are boring so when he rambles it makes it less boring. pretty hard testso study for a few minutes. besides that do your hw and review and you'll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Densmore	2.5	0	Engineering		4	2	2	2	662067	2/2/11	I agree with the storyteller comment. This man could ramble endlessly about things that would never help us with the class, and barely taught the actual material. I really have no idea how I managed to pull an A in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Densmore	2.5	1	Engineering		3	2	3	3	662067	1/24/12	Very very nice man. However, his class is very boring. His voice will put you to sleep. He tells really off topic stories or awkward jokes that no one in the class thinks are funny. I did learn a lot in his class however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Densmore	2.5	0	Engineering		3	1	1	3	662067	8/29/05	Worst teacher or should I say story teller. Forget about learning anything in this class. If you want to learn economics go to the correct department, not the packaging dept. If you want to waste your money take this class! The only reason he's here is because Proctor wants money from Birds Eye Foods...A clear conflict of interests for the school!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Devoe	1.0	0	Criminal Justice		5	1	1	3	1328923	9/20/09	Easy online class, when you can understand what the syllabus and assignments say. The syllabus is vague, and the assignment descriptions are not much better. Getting clarification from the professor is like pulling teeth--requires constant poking and prodding. The lack of responsiveness makes the class a lot more difficult then it should be. Beware
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	530	3	5	5	4	1349618	12/6/12	Took the Auditing course with Dr Dey. She was great and the course was amazing. I learned so much about auditing and how auditors look at companies. I highly recommend this course with Dr Dey. She is great and the course has been very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting		4	5	5	5	1349618	10/24/12	The professor really cares. She is passionate about what she does and really learn from her class. She also brings in professionals and you learn a lot about auditing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	302	2	5	5	1	1349618	10/17/11	take her, she's knowledgeable. don't expect lots of clip art and cute animations in the slides, she is an accountant she just does black and white straight INFO no fancy graphics. also she doesn't grade HW so you better do damn well on the weekly quizzes...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	302	2	5	5	3	1349618	4/20/11	no HW only quizzes, online quizzes and exams none of which can be retaken. online quizzes are tricky as heck. you can take in class quizzes home and return next class but they will be graded out of 40 instead of 50. quizzes are open book. i wish there was more HW so my whole grade didn't depend on tests, i suck at ACC so i am nervous as it is...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	101	2	4	4	2	1349618	4/21/10	The subject by nature is hard. Online hw takes time, but credit for good effort is given.Tests are a LOT of application and based on hw and examples in class. Gives out note packets, easy to follow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	1	Accounting		2	3	3	2	1349618	3/10/10	She's nice, but kind of confusing. The first test was hard, but the 2nd test and final weren't bad. HW was online and annoying, but she was lenient with it if you made an effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	302	3	4	5	3	1349618	2/18/10	She is a good professor. Clean notes and explanations. If you do the HW, you will do fine on the tests. Some of the test questions come right off the HW assignments. She is always willing to help if you don't understand. Recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	708	3	5	5	4	1349618	11/14/12	Dr. Dey is a high quality instructor. She is an expert in the field of auditing and is concerned that her students learn the material. Furthermore, she makes the class enjoyable by bringing in guest speakers to discuss accounting careers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting		2	5	4	1	1349618	2/15/12	Took prior accounting classes with another prof because he was recommended, but Dey was so much better! I got lower grades with the other prof and found that he was difficult to follow. Dey is very straight forward, and her interactive notes were lifesavers on her open book quizzes and tests!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting	202	4	5	3	4	1349618	4/30/11	Prof Dey is pretty laid back and she knows her topic extremely well. She gives extra credit on the test, and she does half online and half in class for quizzes and test. The quizzes are open book open note. Easy to get a good grade if you attend class and fill out the powerpoint notes packet she provides. I would suggest you take her for managerial
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting		2	5	4	5	1349618	10/1/10	Fair professor. Read the book and pay attention and you will get good grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	2	Accounting		1	4	3	4	1349618	3/25/10	Her class was very difficult, but she definitely knows what she's talking about. I was really struggling but I went to her office hours every week, and that really helped. the second test was much easier than the first which was terrible. I didn't like the online homework system we used because there were flaws, but the practice really helped.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mithu Dey	4.3	1	Accounting	302	2	2	4	3	1349618	2/25/10	She made the material more complicated than it needed to be, how ever she was nice an fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sohail Dianat	3.4	0	Electrical Engineering	794	1	2	2	3	721031	5/6/11	Information Theory class sucked!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sohail Dianat	3.4	2	Electrical Engineering	887	1	3	5	5	721031	4/2/09	Dianat is a difficult professor with high expectations, but he teaches very well. Your money is well spent in one of his classes, but don't expect and easy 'A'

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Dicaro	4.9	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	4	5	1042586	6/1/10	Great professor, slides were very informative and the two grades are Midterm (easy) and Group Project (fun). Great CJ class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Dicaro	4.9	2	Criminal Justice	406	4	5	5	3	1042586	5/15/09	Easy class, he said in the beginning of the quarter that there might be a final, there wasn't, there was a group project, and a mid-term, put in a little effort and its easy. Also, he a really nice guy and classes are short.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Dicaro	4.9	2	Criminal Justice	406	4	5	5	4	1042586	1/27/10	Great Professor and funny guy. Took roll call by last name. Kind of lengthy take-home midterm, big but fun group project and no final. We even had a field trip to the Rochester 911 center. Very approachable after/before class. Fun class participations. Answers emails quick. Great person to stay in touch with. Cares about his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Dicaro	4.9	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	4	1042586	2/26/08	Whoa, completely wrong. This teacher is fantastic, he's extremely friendly and easy to talk to. His class's are short and he gives you a handout for every lecture which he bases his midterm on. The class consists of a lengthy take home test and a big group project. Put in some effort and it's easy. One of the better professors in CJ, and no final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography	101	5	5	5	5	252362	4/24/11	the diehlman. he's a boss. i love him, i didn't know anything about photo before i came to school and he taught me everything i know, and i am so amazed and my improvement. he's very understanding and helpful. take what he says and listen, because he is the best photo professor at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	0	Photography		1	1	1	1	252362	10/16/08	It is an embarrassment to my tuition dollars that this man can still teach at any institution that values education. Steve needs not only to be fired but to be publicly disgraced, and forever banned from the world of photography and from being allowed to influence young minds in any way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography		2	5	5	4	252362	9/10/05	Steve was a great prof. He expects alot but is very gratious with his critiques. He tells some great stories as well!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography		3	5	5	NULL	252362	11/18/03	take his advice and run with it! especially when it comes to the nature stuff! go on every field trip - even if you would rather be back in your dorm
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography		4	5	5	5	252362	11/18/09	steve is the man. sometime that is too true and he may be hard to persuade that your photos are good but he knows what hes talking about. awesome teacher, very funny, very knowledgeable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography		3	4	4	2	252362	1/24/08	He's quite funny and that keeps the class from getting boring. He's got a different way of grading, but it's very clear and there's no guesswork as to where your grade came from.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Diehl	4.2	2	Photography		3	5	4	4	252362	4/28/05	He's cool, often funny. he is quite picky so watch out, but as long as you do as he said exactly you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		3	3	4	4	12519	11/18/11	He is a nice guy and curves the exams. On his exams I felt some of his test questions were very random or contained very exact details that no one would remember. The good thing is that the exams are all multiple choice and the written assignments are easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology	101	4	4	5	4	12519	1/27/10	Professor DiFonzo was an AMAZING social psych teacher. He encourages everyone's ideas and class was pretty fun. He is a really funny/cool guy. I would recommend taking social psychology with im!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		4	3	4	3	12519	1/28/07	His class was boring to me - the topic is just too easy and obvious. However, I don't see how he could have made it any more fun. I don't like him too much because he kept trying to "figure me out"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology		2	3	1	2	12519	2/20/06	This professor is very nice and quite amusing my problem is mainly that his syllabus is really unclear. This class is also utterly boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		3	4	4	5	12519	5/19/05	good professor, interesting lectures and teaching style
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	3	12519	2/6/05	Great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology		3	2	2	NULL	12519	5/19/04	good teacher, but needs to write better on the board, somewhat disorganized, but funny at times
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology	714	4	1	1	NULL	12519	4/17/03	Argue with him about your grade and he'll give you an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology		1	1	1	NULL	12519	8/26/01	horid
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology	514	3	5	4	4	12519	1/19/11	I love this prof. His lectures are sometimes dry but can be interesting and he encourages group discussion. Grading is very fair from 1 page assignments, exams etc.... he is very understanding and helpful.... and to be in his favor just give your opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology		1	1	1	1	12519	2/26/09	He is the worst teacher I have ever had in my two years of college. His lectures were extremely dry. Noone could even function in his classes. He can't teach at all and he told his the class would be fun but NOT AT ALL. People just sleep and drool in this class. He was very unclear and unhelpful. I am never taking him again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	1	Psychology		3	4	2	4	12519	5/31/06	nice guy but class was boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		2	3	4	5	12519	2/3/06	I would not recommend DiFonzo for social psychology, during the summer quarter. Way too much work for 5 weeks of class. I was burned out and stressed out from the amount of work I had to do for him and the other class. And I've gotten an A in every other psychology class that I have taken, so it was disappointing to get a C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	1	12519	2/12/05	Very easy class to get an A in as he gives you opportunities to get the A as the course is graded on 3 tests, one presenation/paper and participation in class.. .very clear cut and straightfowarded course not what I have heard from older students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	12519	10/14/04	He was funny and explained everything well. Easy grader, and pretty cool to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Difonzo	3.1	0	Psychology		5	1	1	NULL	12519	9/10/03	He is really, really boring. Does not bring any life to the subject. Would not reccommend his class even though it is not hard to get a good grade.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations	211	3	5	4	3	1639844	1/28/13	Professor Dinneen is very knowledgable and provides great insight in his lectures. He follows the book strictly for American Politics 101, I'm unsure about other classes. I enjoy his lectures. He encourages class participation and you generally will do well so long as you pay attention, do the readings (IMPORTANT!!) and participate in lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations		5	4	4	4	1639844	2/8/12	Great professor, really easy grader. Take home midterm and final that are relatively easy if you do the reading assignments. Although his lectures can be boring and are hard to stay awake in. Definitely recommend if you can tolerate boring lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations		3	5	3	4	1639844	11/10/11	Nice guy, I had a class of engineers that really didn't care but he catered as well as he could to everyone's interests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations	214	3	5	4	4	1639844	10/28/12	He's a really good teacher. The class started out boring, but it got progressively more interesting. He tries to keep everyone interested and help students understand the required reading materials, which can sometimes be pretty dense.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations	214	5	5	5	1	1639844	1/25/12	Light reading assignments. All quiz question answers can be gotten from his lectures or the book. Frequent tangents in lecture, but interesting tangents. Take-home midterm and final exam (two 500 word essays). I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Dinneen	4.3	2	International Relations	101	3	4	4	2	1639844	11/8/11	Prof. Dinneen is a good professor and tries to make what can be a dry topic fun! Essays were graded relatively leniently and he helped students when asked. He was also a great guy to just talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	735730	2/21/13	VERY EASY! If you want an A in DiffEq take her. Class is easy to sit through. Homework due weekly but not hard at all. EASY quizes and she tells you what there on. Exams just like examples in class. She will emphasis the questions that will be on it. Drops 2 homeworks and 1 quiz. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	3	735730	1/31/12	She is really nice and very helpful in and out of class. Do your homework and take notes and it shouldn't be difficult to get an A or B. She tends to make mistakes during lectures, but usually the students point it out before she gets too far. She loves what she does and I would recommend her to anyone beginning calc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics	306	5	4	5	3	735730	4/27/10	She's kinda stupid as all hell, but he class is really easy and you actually learn the material. It's seems like you're going kind slow but you get through everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	1	Mathematics	283	1	4	2	1	735730	3/12/09	Prof. Diute is very nice and likable and concerned about folks' progress, but it can be tough to follow her lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	1	Mathematics	274	3	3	3	3	735730	4/14/08	Not bad. She has a nice personality and tries. Could be better at explaining things, but is very helpful when you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	0	Mathematics		5	1	2	4	735730	2/4/08	She had no idea what she was talking about and often gave poor, or wrong examples. Don't take her if you need to know the material, she is useless
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics	123	4	4	3	4	735730	5/2/06	I had no prior experience with calc before this teacher, at best I was baffled with the meterial due to her teaching style. It wasn't until the 3rd class with her that things began to make sense... Extremely easy grader, great person, I'd reccommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	735730	11/28/05	Upside, you will breeze by in her class. Downside, calculus is boring. I highly recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	3	735730	2/2/12	She is quite a good teacher. Her examples in class may be a bit boring and occasionally hard to follow, however I would not ever hesitate to take one of her classes again. A very positive experience!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	5	735730	10/24/11	I didn't like her at all, she didn't seem qualified to teach the class. If you're good at rote learning, you'll do well, but if not you'll end up frustrated and bored.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	735730	10/7/09	Take her class!! Professor Diute is a character. She really cares about the students. If you attend class and take notes you should ace the class. She has weekly 2 questions quizzes that come straight out of the homework - EASY! Tests are very very fair. She'll go above and beyond to help you during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	1	Mathematics		4	1	4	2	735730	2/1/09	The nicest teacher you'll have (she could teach young kids), but a bit of a klutz when it comes to mathematics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	735730	2/17/08	One of the best math prof's I've had. Especially good for non-math majors. Knowledgeable, fair grader, makes the material pretty easy. The people complaining here were probably destined to fail matrix algebra/calc with any professor (Or are too lazy to read the book. That's right idiots, you have to read the book too).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	3	735730	1/31/07	Prof. Diute doesn't seem to know what she is talking about usually. She makes a lot of mistakes, which makes learning in her class a challenge. Still, she grades very easily. She also hands out review packets, which is just the test with different numbers. Tests easily, so as long as you prepare a little, you will do fine on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	3	4	735730	4/23/06	very easy grader, tells you pretty much exactly what is going to be on quizzes and tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Diute	3.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	3	735730	10/25/05	She is very lenient with grades and fair with work. Not too much work. Get her on your good side and its a simple class. Kinda hard to sit through lectures, but arent all profs? Reccomend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paula Dolan	2.5	1	Business		5	1	4	1	1206692	11/14/08	I do not like her teaching style at all. What ever you do don't take her once a week at night because she will try to talk for the entire period. The period is 4 hours long, with 1 10 minute break. She will even keep teaching when she starts messing up her presentation because she wants to keep everyone in class. Read the book & class slides.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Doolittle	4.9	2	Science		1	5	5	3	474325	3/24/06	Dr. D is the best teacher I ever had. His class was really hard but a great experience. He taught me that I could figure things out for myself if I just worked hard enough. He really cares if his students learn, and he has a great sense of humor even if it's not apparent at first.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	0	Computer Science	229	3	1	1	5	434122	1/27/11	She is a nice lady if you are on her favorite's list. Only take her if you have NO other choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	2	Computer Science		5	3	4	4	434122	10/31/10	She is a very happy and nice lady, but she is a horrible teacher. Like another rater said, she treats the class like they are 5. If you try to do anything that isn't sunshine and happiness with your animations, she immediately dislikes it. Poor teacher, and biased, often loses herself in playing around with an example (ignores the class).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	2	Computer Science		3	3	4	4	434122	2/23/07	Nancy is a nice lady, I feel like she plays favorites though and i wasn't one of them. Her practical was hard but she did give a retake. Really dry in lecture though, don't expect to be entertained. She is a fair grader and expect to recieve a grade for attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	0	Computer Science		2	3	1	1	434122	9/19/05	Teacher continued using terms in class that were associated with Art in a class of Information Technology students and refused to divulge on the meanings. This was in 1998 perhaps she has learned more about computers and forgot some of that art.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	5	434122	11/18/04	Passionate about interesting subject material. Very helpful if asked. Will go out of her way to find a bug in your code on her own time, and email the solution back to you -- so long as you have obviously put your effort in.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	0	Computer Science		5	2	2	5	434122	1/18/11	Doubleday is nice as everyone else here said. However I believe she belongs in teaching elementary school. She treats you like you are 5, and as someone else said making happy fun sunshine animations is the only way to get a solid grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	1	Computer Science		4	2	3	1	434122	9/29/10	She is a nice lady, but she treats the class like we are 5. I think she has downs, so a lot of the stuff we go over is either just reading her code, which she doesnt seem to know how to use, or working with craig reynolds equations. Boring as all hell
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	2	434122	11/15/06	Very fast-paced course. As a non-IT major, I found this course and concepts difficult to understand. She's willing to help, but often times I didn't find her help to be very, well helpful. She would just point at a line of code and say "That's not doing what you think it's doing" and walk away. Very nice woman though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	434122	2/23/05	Excellent teacher - although her lectures leave something to be desired, she always makes examples fun and stupid. Most of her classes are self-taught - you read the book or she'll give you some code and you fool around with it. If you really can't figure it out, she's more than willing to help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Doubleday	2.7	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	NULL	434122	7/15/04	Horrible in every way! Her lectures are disorganized and she makes you feel like an idiot when you ask questions. She also didn't give out a single grade until week 7, when it was already too late to withdraw. She tends to misgrade projects as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Doyle	3.2	1	Literature		1	3	2	2	552551	10/21/08	Grades extremely hard. Grades your first draft and then final then averages the two together. Not a huge fan of her teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Doyle	3.2	2	Literature		4	5	4	3	552551	2/2/06	Easiest writing instructor in RIT! All you had to do is read a short story for every class, discuss it and write 3 short essays (for the whole quarter) on any of the stories. Very helpful. Doesn't give out "serious" topics for assignments. If you like reading and doesn't like writing that much, take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Doyle	3.2	2	Literature		4	4	4	4	552551	4/23/06	Very nice teacher, easy to talk to and get along with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Catherine Doyle	3.2	0	Literature		2	1	3	3	552551	1/11/05	Assigns too much busywork. Claims I was absent on days I am positive I was there. Announced in front of the entire class that I scored a 45 on a quiz. Very unhelpful when I needed to make up work due to being sick FOR ONE DAY. I will never take her again EVER.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	2	Political Science	211	4	5	5	4	1438245	1/24/12	Awesome teacher! Do the readings. It's a good idea to go to class, you are tested on what is discussed in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	2	Political Science		5	4	5	4	1438245	4/23/11	Very easy and enjoyable class, has a lot of student participation and encourages discussion. Weekly quizzes on textbook reading but they are very easy, as are his tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	2	Political Science	101	4	5	5	3	1438245	9/9/10	Really great professor, keeps the class very current and gets students to participate. As long as you do the readings his tests are not difficult. Easy weekly quizzes over current events and one group project. Great class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	2	Political Science	101	4	5	5	1	1438245	8/19/11	This guy is the man... I enjoyed coming to class and the work was very reasonable. Just read and take notes during lectures and you will be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	1	Political Science	101	3	2	4	1	1438245	10/22/10	Boring class, the work is pretty easy and hes a pretty easy grader, but there is not a lot of opportunity for cushioning the grades. Most of your grade is based off your midterm and final. He gave plenty of class time for the project
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Dube	4.6	2	Political Science	211	5	5	5	1	1438245	5/1/10	He knows quite a lot what he's talking about. He keeps his lectures interesting and encourages discussion in class. There are reading assignments every week. Also there is a very easy 2 question quiz every week where 1 question is over the reading. Good professor, highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Dickson	4.2	2	Humanities		4	5	5	4	829172	3/2/12	Donna is very challenged with her assignments but Great professor, I got her for my Employee engagement class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Dickson	4.2	2	Humanities	710	3	5	4	2	829172	4/23/11	Took a graduate class from her.. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Dickson	4.2	1	Humanities		3	3	3	5	829172	4/6/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Dickson	4.2	2	Humanities	710	3	4	3	4	829172	4/23/11	Great teacher!! I definitely would recommend her to anybody!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Dickson	4.2	2	Humanities	626	2	5	5	5	829172	2/24/10	Donna is the most wonderful professor I've ever had. She's tough but fair, extremely knowledgeable and 110% committed to student success.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zach Dietl	5.0	2	Design		3	5	5	3	1751014	11/9/12	One of the funniest and most laid-back, effective teachers and friends I've ever had. Sign up today for the Zachary Dietl experience! You won't regret it! Unless you're lazy and hate work. Cuz he does give work. That will make you amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Dingman	2.2	0	Engineering		2	1	1	4	768511	5/21/06	crappiest teacher ive ever had. he always messes up examples, and gives the crappiest notes. he is ok in lab but still sucks at life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Dingman	2.2	0	Engineering		1	3	1	4	768511	2/28/06	Good prof only if you are motivated and good at being self taught. Never gives good example problems...off topic consistently...poor lectures. Awkward and moody def. I'd avoid him unless you like lots of studying and work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Dingman	2.2	0	Engineering		2	1	2	4	768511	12/1/05	Where to begin...well, avoid him at all costs. I guess that's all I can say. He is useless, has a bad temper, is not at all helpful, and entirely not on your side. Need I say more?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Dingman	2.2	2	Engineering		3	5	4	4	768511	3/2/06	Prof. Dingman is a very good professor. He teaches freshman classes so people often think he is tough, but really he's not one to wait for you to realize you are not in high school anymore. He is always very helpful with ampel office hours. He helps you understand expectations in industry as well as in college.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Dingman	2.2	0	Engineering		1	2	2	3	768511	2/9/06	Not a good professor. Me's moody, and doesnt present the material in a consistent manor at all. Jumps all over the place when writing on the board, and gets his own example problems wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1259855	2/26/13	Great professor! Very approachable and helpful. Interjects funny (and still relatable) stories in class. Don't challenge him to a foot race... you'll lose... (I think he's an ultra-marathoner...)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1259855	12/10/12	He is a really good professor and is very clear during his lectures. He makes lectures interesting and is polite. Weekly online homework, 2 tests and a final. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	1259855	11/14/12	Excellent professor! Really knows his stuff and presents it excellently to class. Homework every week, exams, same ol stuff. Fair grader. Stresses which details are important to absolutely know. Very helpful outside class and answers emails promptly. Highly recommend him. Wish he taught data stats 2
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	2	1259855	1/25/12	Fantastic Professor! Who else could relate mutually exclusive events to Boy Meets World. Asks you what you think the answer is before even starting the problem, which has actually been VERY helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	2	2	1259855	4/20/11	he was cool, VERY helpful and patient. not my style of teaching though unfortunately the slides contained too much text and not enough white space. do not take if you're not already math inclined otherwise you will love him. tests are fun and worded for pop culture (references to Will Ferrell movies and The Office). He is like 25... very smart
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1259855	2/3/11	Where to start? Posts all lectures and answers to exercises and exams on mycourses, excellent at explaining concepts, easy grader, straightforward with exam questions, extremely helpful. Also stays an extra hour after class teaching students if needed. I couldn't ask more from a professor. I HATE math and he somehow managed to make it tolerable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	1	1259855	11/16/10	Great young professor.Does a wonderful job explaining information. Makes the information easy to understand. You can tell he loves/knows the subject. I would take more classes from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	4	1259855	4/22/10	Awesome professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1259855	4/27/09	First statistics class I didn't hate going to. Easy to talk to. Didn't even mind that it was a night class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	1259855	3/10/09	Fairly young looking and not that bad looking either! Not sure how the class will keep going, but splits class into 1 hour lecture and 1 hour group assignment. My opinion could change though later in the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	1259855	12/12/12	Super nice guy. The class was extremely boring but other then that it was pretty simple. If youre lost just ask for help. he wants his students to understand
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	101	4	5	5	3	1259855	11/20/12	One of the best professors I have ever had! Very, very helpful in and outside the classroom. If you dont understand something he will make sure you do before he moves on. Makes the class interesting and keeps your attention. Definitely take him if possible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1259855	2/12/12	DATA I: he know his stuffs. 3 tests + 2 quizzes + no homework. you ask, he answers. polite, nice, funny, cool, understandable. yeah, and handsome. :) take him if you can. data class isn't that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	4	1259855	4/26/11	Who knew under that beard was a young guy! I look older than him. Someone in class said he was probably a prodigy or something. Either way, extremely helpful and encouraging. Gave himself a fu manchu since the class did well on an exam. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	4	1259855	2/3/11	This professor was great - made the material easy to understand and actually interesting. Would take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	1	1259855	1/29/11	Dude is great! Didn't understand something and went to office hours and almost got a perfect score on the next exam! Takes the time to ensure students understand. Easy to access even if through email. Take his class!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	4	1259855	5/18/10	Professor Dirmyer is the best! You can tell he actually enjoys coming to class, which to some extent gets you to enjoy it as well. He's a tad funny as well!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	2	5	4	3	1259855	1/14/10	Professor Dirmyer really wants you to succeed. He posts the answers to things on mycourses and makes the lectures fly by.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Dirmyer	4.7	2	Mathematics	319	3	3	4	3	1259855	3/24/09	Gives a decent amount of work. Half the class you spend on group assignments which are fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Dodd	2.5	0	Design		3	1	1	3	1405021	1/30/11	This class isn't very hard persay, however if you want to be taught by someone who comes up with projects you could do in highschool, takes vacations to hawaii mid-quarter but still expects YOU to go to class, refuses to take suggestions, has a monotonous voice, and who favors asians and suckups then hes the guy for you!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Dodd	2.5	2	Design		5	5	4	3	1405021	3/19/10	Projects are fun, but he's a little monotonous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Dodd	2.5	0	Design		3	2	2	3	1405021	1/30/11	He likes to repeat himself over and over just using different terms each time. You'd swear he loves his own voice or something. Make sure to stay on top of your journal, he makes it seem like it's your life. If you don't have it and keep it up to date the world may end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Donnelly	5.0	2	Packaging Science	607	5	5	5	5	1746621	9/6/12	A Fun, excellent Professor who shares his deep knowledge and understanding in the field of packaging production lines. Lectures are interesting with videos included. Only 2 homework articles,2 test and a final project are required. EASY GRADER! and One of my favorite classes in the field of packaging
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	5	403330	2/28/12	Dorsey is a fantastic teacher and artist. He has a passion for what he does and for inspiring others to do the same. He also likes to make jokes and get on everyone's good side. Can be a tough grader on certain projects, but tries to be more than fair. Also, his demos will leave you speechless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	4	5	5	403330	10/24/07	love love love... the best illustration professor at RIT. Try to take at least one bob class per quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	403330	10/28/05	you learn a lot from the guy, he's amazing at what he does...has a great sense of humor...one of the coolest teachers to take at RIT...basically....all i can say is that i wanna be like bob when i grow up...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	403330	8/30/05	Bob Dorsey was an awesome teacher and an outstanding illustrator. I learned so much in his classes. Pretty cool guy as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		5	4	4	NULL	403330	5/6/04	Good Artist. Can be too easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	3	403330	11/20/11	I felt like we weren't given a lot of help/direction in the beginning but i enjoyed this class. His demos are very helpful & his grades are somewhat hard but definitely fair. Just put a significant amount of effort into your projects and you'll do fine =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	403330	8/1/06	Bob is a great guy to have teach you - great on demos, good at getting critique discussions going, laid back to allow you to find out new techniques. Loved studying under him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		2	4	3	4	403330	9/2/05	Dorsey is awesome. He is so down to earth and can teach you so much. Even if he is a pain in your butt, you have to like him, that is just how he is. Hi oooooooooooo
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Dorsey	4.4	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	403330	3/6/05	Dorsey is not only very friendly, but also extremely talented. You can learn a lot from him in all aspects of illustration, from techniques to marketing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	0	Biology	305	5	2	1	1	290314	5/21/10	Umm...She won Best Teacher Award but I honestly don't see how. I was excited when I read that she won, but I was CLEARLY lied to. She's very random, goes completely off-topic and unfortunately, her lack of organization causes a low attendance rate. She is nice, but a very horrible teacher. Take it with someone else if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	0	Biology	350	3	2	2	5	290314	5/15/08	Yeah she is all over the place with her teaching, very disorganized and goes over alot of stuff multiple times randomly. Her slides don't give much information so you have to listen to her, and even then you won't get too much out of it-read the book if you really want to learn stuff. When you answer a question she'll always tell you you're right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	0	Biology	350	5	1	1	1	290314	11/20/07	She went on sabbatical and I'm pretty sure her mental state is still there because she wont teach you anything. Had her for Molec Bio and she hardly ever made her own test questions and many of them had more then one answer or no answer at all. really nice though...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	290314	1/31/06	Great teacher! Won the outstanding teacher award on campus. Is definitely student oriented and willing to help us do well in class and after.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		4	5	5	5	290314	10/19/05	Dr. D is one of the best professors in the department. she takes interest in all her students and trys hard to get to know everyone. Her teaching style is laid back and she presents the material in a way that it is fairly easy to understand. She is also easy to approach and is great to sit down and chat with anytime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		4	4	5	NULL	290314	11/18/03	Very nice women, stimulating and cares for her students, makes learning easy and fun while challenging at the same time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		3	5	3	3	290314	5/15/10	She is a very, very nice person. Probably one of my favorite professors at RIT. However, she can be difficult to understand at times. She is amazing at teaching labs (take her for lab if you can), but her lectures aren't as great. She tries, but it can be a rough road in the beginning. It gets better once you get use to her teaching style, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		5	4	3	3	290314	4/23/08	Um, terribly nice, but... haphazard. Sometimes in lab I'd ask a question and she would literally say "go away." A bit of an oddball, but a very nice lady.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	0	Biology	350	3	2	2	3	290314	8/22/07	A nice person, very social... but kind of a really bad teacher. You try to hate her, because she is so bad, but you can't because she is just this really nice hippie.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	0	Biology		5	1	2	3	290314	4/6/07	worhtless!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	290314	1/27/07	Very helpful in lab, friendly and approachable. She is wonderfu.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		3	5	4	5	290314	10/23/05	Hands down, one of the greatest professors at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean Douthwright	3.0	2	Biology		2	4	3	3	290314	10/18/04	Nice lady, but her lectures were sort of haphazard. Needed to read the textbook to learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	206	5	1	2	3	576466	3/4/13	Was very difficult to understand and follow during lectures. Lacked self-confidence. Ended up teaching myself the material, and avoided his lectures like the plague. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	576466	11/11/12	He is terrible. Writes examples on the board then decides they are wrong and erases them. Examples in class are relatively simple when done correctly, but the he gives 30-40 homework problems that are absolutely ridiculous. The exams are hard too, tricky. He doesn't give enough time to take the tests either. Doesn't seem to care if you understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	3	576466	11/10/12	Doesn't always seem confident about what he's saying and sometimes has trouble giving good examples, but if you need help he's always willing to give it. He's very approachable and easy to work with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	576466	2/22/12	Awesome professor, accepts late homework, is extremely helpful during office hours, fields homework questions during class, drops lowest test grade, gives extra credit,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	5	576466	11/28/11	His lectures can sometimes be painfully boring, but it was probably one of the easiest classes I've taken. There are so many free points, grades dropped, and makeup opportunities its crazy. I recommend him for any person taking multivariable calculus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	576466	1/31/11	TERRIBLE, worst teacher I've had at RIT by FAR
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	576466	10/29/10	He is a nice guy but his teaching methods do not work i struggled a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	3	576466	1/27/10	He knows his stuff and is a nice guy but is not a good teacher. He is very smart but generally fails to put the material in terms that is easy to understand as a student. He is a very harsh grader with difficult exams. The biggest problem is the emphasis on WebAssign, it just isnt a good medium for Calculus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics	265	3	4	2	2	576466	8/26/09	Class consists of weekly homeworks, 2 projects, 3 exams and extra credit. Every class started with review from the last lecture and then learning one new thing. The review was a waste of time and most people didn't even bother showing up. I felt like I didn't learn much but the class was easy and Dreibelbis will help you understand everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics	265	5	4	4	5	576466	3/12/09	He's a pretty quiet guy and seems a bit nervous when teaching, but it's clear he really knows his stuff. The assignments were long but were relevant to the material we would be tested on, and he grades fairly. Overall, he's not bad, and I learned a lot from his Discrete class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	576466	2/8/13	He's a really nice guy, but I think he's still learning how to teach. The quizzes and exams are reasonable, but you do get that occasional ridiculously hard problem. The homework on the other hand is almost always ridiculously hard. He seems to ad lib through class, but if you ask questions he's good at clarifying. Drops lowest exam/quiz/HW
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	283	2	2	1	3	576466	11/11/12	On a very frequent basis I  and classmates I spoke with  felt that not only was the professor unprepared for the daily lesson, but not sufficiently competent in either the material to be taught, or the actual process of teaching it. I attended class only to be continually disappointed by the lack of useful teaching accomplished every day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	2	576466	5/21/12	take good notes and you will excel at the homework, quizzes, and tests. sometimes he goes off on a tangent about the proof of an equation, but this is not really necessary. otherwise, the examples he does in class are really good and help a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		5	3	2	4	576466	12/2/11	If you actually want to learn Multivariable Calculus, do NOT take it with Dreibelbis. We learned double integrals in the last hour of the last class, and we were so far behind the other classes it was ridiculous. Otherwise, he's a really easy (yet painfully slow moving) teacher (kind of a pushover, actually) and it's an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	206	1	1	1	1	576466	8/9/11	Doesn't allow enough time for tests. I haven't finished one, just wrote down something in hoping I might get some credit! Week nine and we have three hw's due, a third test yet, and a final four days later, and oh he's still teaching new material...Horrible Teacher!!! Steer clear!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	265	1	2	2	2	576466	1/15/11	He's a nice guy, but he doesn't know how to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics	265	3	3	2	4	576466	5/26/10	He's really nice, but he's not a good teacher. He always seems uncomfortable. He doesn't deliver material with confidence, which gives the impression that he doesn't know what he is talking about. I think he is new to teaching, so these things may work themselves out. For now, though, I would not take another class from him, if I had a choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		4	4	2	4	576466	11/7/09	Not a bad prof. He is a bit boring to listen to, but his grading system is more than fair and the workshops are a great help in learning the material. Lectures are long-winded. I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to get him, but if you do have him as a prof, you should be OK. Just do the work and show up for class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	206	1	1	2	3	576466	8/11/09	Nice guy. However, Professor is vague and unclear on expectations. Plays favorites, and takes off every point he can even if you get the concept. I would recommend strongly against taking this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	3	576466	1/22/09	Really nice, smart guy. He knows his calculus but he has trouble simplifying it to our level. He is basically the human incarnation of the textbook when it comes to teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	4	576466	3/9/08	Boring!! Really smart guy, just hard to follow his voice. It's very monotone and unenthusiastic. If you need to catch up on some sleep, take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	3	576466	10/24/07	Passionate, but very quiet professor. Not very good at explaining the material, but is willing to meet outside of class. Good character, but not an excellent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	4	576466	10/21/07	easy as hell diddnt learn much. he liked to "abandon ship" during example problems and class was kinda dry
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	576466	5/24/07	I thought he was an amazing professor. He was not always the most clear on what he wanted, but he realized this and wouldn't grade to harshly. He was very helpful outside of class, and in class he at the very least really tried to make it understandable. This was his first quarter teaching and I think that is why he was kind of nervous. Take him :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	3	4	2	576466	3/7/07	Quizzes once a week, only time I attended the class, aside from tests (3 per quarter). Homework due once a week. Easy Class. Always reviews what was tought the class before so it makes going once a week a breeze
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	576466	11/1/06	He would not finish example problems in the lecture, using the excuse that we all knew what "to do from there". Tests were fair. He was always very nervous in class and thought we were playing practical jokes on him. Poor guy should not be a teacher, i really feel bad for him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	576466	4/27/06	Absolutely horrible professor. He knows his stuff, but is inept at presenting it. Definitely avoid him. Not only did he suck at teaching, but he was also incredibly inconsiderate. The interpreter didn't show up one day (my class was half deaf, half hearing), and not only did he not cancel, but he didn't even try to help the deaf students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	576466	2/7/06	Terrible professor. Joel needs to take a teaching course and learn how to project as well as get the message of the lessons in class across. Do not sign up for this professor if you want to pass with a decent grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	576466	9/29/05	Grad student teaching class... Does no clearly explain concepts at all, pretty much assumes you'll get it from the homework. Tests are not reflective of homework but of in class theory. Questions are often asked that he is incapable of answering because he can not think of how to explain it other than just whip it up on the board real quick.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	1	576466	11/19/07	He is obviously very intelligent-- but he simply can't make his ideas coherent to the class. The homework assignments were difficult (and never explained), the tests had ridiculous foreign proofs rather than real "number problems" and he was awful at answering student questions and explaining work. Nice guy but I would NEVER take his class again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics	366	3	1	1	2	576466	10/21/07	Terrible teacher! Cannot explain anything, even when getting help on homework he "draws a blank" and can't help. Tests are hard, homeworks take about 2 hours. Handed out a project that was supposed to be due in 2 weeks, even though he hadn't taught anything on it, had to extend due date because he took too long to teach it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	4	2	3	576466	9/17/07	he does not seem to know what he is doing. i feel bad for him. helpful but clueless and too young to be teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	576466	5/15/07	He was a bit nervous, but extremely helpful outside of class. He's a really great guy, I don't see why everyone thinks he's so bad. I personally found him to be extremely kind and more than willing to take time to help you on questions you may have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	5	576466	2/22/07	He explains things thorougly but tends to be a llttle dry at times. Come to workshop and class, do your homework and you'll be fine. He's pretty good about grading and flexible - sometimes gives extra credit assignments as well, which are all based off workshop.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	3	576466	8/11/06	I don't doubt that the guy has sufficient knowledge of the math portion of this course. But as far as applying this to engineering, he clearly doesn't understand the material enough. He's also quite boring and doesn't explain things very well. He does however host a review session before each test outside of class which I did find useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	3	576466	3/3/06	he knew the stuff but was****ty at explaining it. We learned everything from the book. of a full class, it was often only attended by 6-8 people because no1 ever learned anything from him. he does grade fairly, evenly and consistently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	2	576466	10/19/05	Very nice guy but his teaching style is boring and repeative. When you get a final grade of a quarter, he will give you a curve to a better grade above if you are this close.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Dreibelbis	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	576466	3/4/05	Was a graduate student when he taught the class. In some cases, he explained things very clearly but in others, very confusing. Excellent grading (will give a curve if everybody did poorly).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	2	Fine Arts		5	4	4	3	287809	10/28/09	Many dont like his teaching style. If you are worried meet with him first then you will know weather you like him or not. I loved him he took interest and encouraged what you were interested in not what he wanted you to be doing, and let you direct yourself more. I would take every class he offered, but that is just me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	287809	8/1/06	Bill knows this stuff and this is a great class. I would recommend taking a class with him if you can get into one he rarley teaches
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	287809	12/12/05	Get on his good side and you will be there forever. Very helpful to me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	2	287809	8/30/05	he doesn't care at all about anyone but himself. he is only concerned with how you will make RIT look once you graduate...if only he'd actually help you get there! he shouldn't be teaching becuase he doesn't have time for students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	0	Fine Arts		5	1	1	NULL	287809	4/5/04	Loves to hear himself talk, not as concerned with what he says as he is with department politics. Nice enough guy, but a teaching lightweight. Skip his course, buy the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	NULL	287809	11/18/03	this is one of the best photo classes at RIT - take it, learn from it - and work your a$$ off - the result will pay off
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	4	287809	1/16/07	At first I was very excited to take his class, then I met him...very arrogant, even **** at times. Continually told everyone only good things about their work in crit yet would give failing final grades - that's not how crit works - you learn that the first day! Does not care nor have time for his students!! He should not be allowed to teach!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	5	287809	12/13/05	Ive only meet with Bill a few times and he's been nothing but helpful. Maybe i came in on his good side, but i'd say its a good place to be. He seems to be interested in helping me.Hes hard to get an appt with, but everytime Ive meet with him,hes been great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	287809	9/1/05	Arrogant. Doesn't know his ass from his elbow. Said my co-op (which wasn't even necessary for my major) was pointless to my education. Jerk.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	2	4	287809	11/10/04	Worst prof I ever had. Almost made me want to quit photo yet I had excelled in every other photo class. Loves to hear himself ramble about what great/difficult stuff he has done in his career. Has no concern/interest for his students, belittles them. Does not know how to properly critique.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	NULL	287809	12/25/03	told me i couldn't play a sport and major in photo. almost made me pick...thank god i didn't listen to him. has no idea what a well rounded education really is!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Dubois	2.8	1	Fine Arts		5	3	3	NULL	287809	11/15/03	He got rid of Lynn. He talks to you as if you were a child, or small animal.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Constantino Dumagane	2.1	0	Economics		5	3	1	NULL	6372	3/9/03	Very hard to understand, but you can get a C if you go to class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Constantino Dumagane	2.1	2	Economics	101	2	5	2	NULL	6372	2/3/03	The hardness of the class depends on how much effort you put into it

Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	467613	1/30/12	Great teacher. Interesting stories to accompany the material. Read the damn textbook
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	467613	11/30/09	Good professor. Good labs. not too much workload. lectures can be a little boring. nice guy. tests are not too bad if you study some.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		2	4	4	5	467613	10/6/08	Really nice and knows what he is doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	467613	3/2/07	Great Guy, does his best to keep it interesting, concrete smashing is awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	2	467613	10/23/05	Hes really cooky. Fun guy, really nice and understanding, He actually has personality which is hard to find these days at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering	422	2	4	5	4	467613	10/22/10	Great professor. Makes the class interesting. Has a lot of work experience that he refers to in his lectures. A lot of assigned reading, but if you do it the tests are fine. The book is required and definitely used.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering	330	3	5	5	5	467613	2/8/09	Great, I strive to get his classes. One of my favorites
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		2	5	5	1	467613	10/4/07	Great Guy. Really HOT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	3	3	467613	10/26/05	Really good teacher. Tries his best to get students interested in classes, although it may be boring periodically. Labs contain pretty cool hands-on experiments. As long as you complete homework and attend the classes, you should have no problem passing that class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Dunn	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	467613	10/4/04	Very Clear and straigh forward lecture. If you read the material the tests should be on the easy side.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Durr	3.5	2	Social Science	104	2	2	5	1	955033	1/21/09	Well, she is actually a good teacher. But I'm simply not interested in her subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Eastman	4.5	1	Engineering		2	1	5	3	136200	4/22/10	reminds me of the german sniper in "enemy at the gates"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Eastman	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	136200	6/16/05	Great teacher. Even though I was struggling. He worked hard to help me
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Eastman	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	136200	2/26/10	Eastman is basically like an employer. He is very helpful when you ask questions. His method is to let you think through your questions alongside him, until a solution is found. He is a reasonable professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Eastman	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	136200	2/19/03	One of the best. He is demanding, but will help you a ton if you ask.

Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	0	Psychology	101	1	1	1	4	1341614	2/11/13	He yelled at me for no particular reason. I told him he was making no sense and he held a grudge against me the rest of the quarter. Rambled about random stuff. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology		3	4	5	4	1341614	3/1/12	Was fun for social psychology. Always kept the talks interesting, stopped lectures to show videos that were both interesting and relevant to the topic, and is overall a good guy to have a class with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	0	Psychology	101	3	1	2	3	1341614	11/16/11	He tries hard but is very insecure. His grading policy was arbitrary and there were only a few grades. His classes were boring. He will offer help but it was not that useful. In conclusion he is "nice" but extremely incompetent and immature.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology		2	5	5	4	1341614	1/31/11	Awesome professor! Heavy in discussion. 3 tests all quarter, a short paper, a large research paper with a presentation at the end. Very enjoyable class
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	0	Psychology	101	5	1	3	3	1341614	12/10/09	In trying to be helpful, this faculty member is almost too easy on students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology	101	2	5	4	5	1341614	10/24/09	New teacher, really nice. Only grades were one-page really easy essay, tests, and one big paper. Fair class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	0	Psychology		2	1	1	4	1341614	3/10/12	His lectures were random and were hard to follow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	0	Psychology		3	1	1	3	1341614	11/18/11	His class is not hard but be careful not to get on his bad side. He seemed to be very sensitive. His grading policy did not make sense at times. HIs humor was not appropriate at times and he often went off into random rants.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology		4	5	5	3	1341614	2/8/11	Professor Edlund knows what he's talking about & is always willing to help students. His tests are relatively easy if you study off his study guides and skim through the textbook. My ideal professor, take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology		2	4	4	3	1341614	1/25/10	I have him for Intro to psych he has made the class lots of fun the tests are really hard but he has other work for you to offset them Because of him i am declaring into psych he is very approachable and nice and reading the text book is madetory
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Edlund	3.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	1	1341614	11/17/09	Incredibly enthusiastic teacher. Three tests, 5 "short papers" and one long paper make up your grade. Uses powerpoints and review sheets-- there's no way you can't do well in this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Egert	3.5	2	Information Technology	101	5	5	4	5	927396	11/9/11	Had him for Freshmen Seminar for GD&D. He's really funny and knows a lot. He's one of the heads of the department so get to know him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Egert	3.5	1	Information Technology		5	3	2	4	927396	1/31/07	Disorganized. Spends insufficient time looking at projects while grading them. Misses assignments that were turned in, giving a 0. Claimed I was missing class when I wasn't. Easy, but not recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Egert	3.5	2	Information Technology	542	5	5	4	5	927396	6/18/08	Took Data enabled Casual Games with him, a 500 level seminar class. A Lot of freedom involved but enabled the entire class to come up with innovative games and engines.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Egert	3.5	1	Information Technology		5	3	2	5	927396	12/2/06	Interactive Digital Media The class was very easy. The projects took a lot of time but they were pretty much the only homework that he gave. He didn't really expect much of us, seeing as how he didn't teach us much. It was a lot of learning the material on your own through examples or trial and error. The second project (a flash game) was very fu
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	1	Literature		1	3	2	3	809217	4/24/11	Class is terrible. He talks nonstop and just rambles on about things that he pulls from nowhere. Good luck trying to figure out what's being taught.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature	227	2	5	4	1	809217	10/30/08	It is an interesting class, and I learned a lot, but there is a lot of required reading with occasional reading quizzes. He is not an easy grader either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature		4	5	5	4	809217	7/9/07	Really cares about students learning material. He's really a great professor and easy to talk with in class. He has open discussions and most ppl feel comfortable in his classroom. He's easy going and open to student opinions. I'd take as many classes with him as possible. Also good at remembering names!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature		4	5	5	5	809217	12/5/06	I have taken two class with him-he is by far my favorite professor I have ever had at RIT. He is enthusiastic and the class discussions are engaging and fun. He is very personable-take his class!! any of them!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature		4	5	5	2	809217	1/21/10	Good class for a mandatory one, he's very insightful and tells you how to get an A. My writing has improved drastically. He's also like a J Crew add... not that bad at 8 am.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature		2	4	4	4	809217	7/14/08	A nice guy, interesting class. Somewhat hard on grading. But he's willing to discuss his resoning and take a second look.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature	524	3	4	3	5	809217	3/8/07	Contemporary Film We had 4 quizzes and 3 major papers. There was this presentation at the end of the class that we had to give, but it wasn't that bad. Knows what he's talking about and very thought provoking. Homework usually requires reading from the book and viewing recent movies. Overall a very good teacher, just have to provide good essays.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Babak Elahi	4.3	2	Literature		4	5	5	4	809217	2/8/06	He is such a father. He has kids and you can definetly tell. He has a really good sense of humor and is always interested in different opinions. He gets all bouncy and excited about stuff. He's very entusiastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brenden Eng	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1721446	5/20/12	Very knowledgeable and fun instructor, always willing to answer question you have on the topic. Highly recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brenden Eng	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	4	1721446	5/9/12	Excellent leader! Knows exactly how to get everyone involved in activities, makes you push yourself and gives you confidence. Definitely recommend taking a wellness course with him. So much fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brenden Eng	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1721446	5/14/12	Great leader for this class. Extremely knowledgeable on just about anything outdoors; any question I could think of he had an answer for. Very laid back when just hanging around, but serious when the situation called for it (setting up top ropes, climbing at the crag, etc.). Looking forward to taking more outdoor classes with him in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy	404	3	5	5	3	480304	4/20/11	Best teacher I have had here. Amazing, would highly recommend. His upper level classes usually consist of 4 essays and readings. Come to class and pay attention and he'll give you everything you need to know about the material on a silver plate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	4	480304	11/14/09	Goes over every reading in class. Explain it multiple times so everyone can understand. Quizzes are a little difficult, them being true/false based on subjective opinions and interpretations. Pay close attention to him and the readings to do well on them. He grades a bit hard on the essays. Grammar Nazi. Put your opinion in it, or get a bad grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	5	3	480304	10/21/09	My favorite professor at RIT. Always available when I needed extra help and responds to emails quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	3	480304	4/27/09	He is quite possibly the most adorable man you will ever meet. Not in like a hot way just the way that he presents himself and looks at the world it's amazing. And he is a fabulous teacher and really helpful you just have to pay attention. I learned so much from him i decided to make philosophy my minor :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	0	Philosophy	101	1	2	2	4	480304	10/16/08	No offense to those who love him, but my friends and I greatly dislike him as a teacher. His T/F quizzes are arguable either way, and it often does not matter how well you know the material, as every question is worded in such a way as to confuse you greatly. He knows his stuff, it's just the delivery that drives us batty.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy	210	4	5	5	4	480304	4/3/07	Engstrom is the man, quite possibly the best teacher I have ever had, he is an awesome teacher that really knows how to make you comprehend material. We watched Total Recall in class and then wrote an *optional* essay on it. awesome? I think so. He made Aristotle, Plato, Spinosa, Descartes, and others interesting! I definetly reccomend this teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	1	Philosophy		2	4	1	2	480304	4/27/06	If you are not the best auditory processor, this guy is not for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	480304	2/9/06	One word: awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	480304	10/30/05	take any class he teaches
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	4	480304	4/11/05	One of the most challenging courses ive taken. He really gets everyone involved and is very intelligent! Inspiring man outside of the class too and VERY helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	2	480304	12/3/09	LOVE HIM. he was extremely intelligent, and i felt like he knew so much about what he was talking about. great professor. take a lot of notes, and work hard on the essays and you will be fine. also, he is an extremely understanding guy. he always has a mug.. i always wondered if he had some whiskey in there or something. =-) hes wonderful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	0	Philosophy	101	3	2	2	1	480304	11/3/09	Class to me was long and boring! The class was hard to get used to but it was not a hard class ! he made some of the class conversations fun and enjoyable. grade was based on the in class quiz given about once a week, and essays ! not to bad of a class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	5	480304	5/17/09	Professor is extremely helpful and generous with his time. He cares a great deal about the material and comes to class with an upbeat, optimistic attitude. He is always cheerful and has a wonderful sense of humour. Classes are always highly interesting and worthwhile. This professor is amazingly adept at teaching and highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	1	Philosophy		2	4	2	5	480304	4/15/09	Professor Engstrom may very well be the most intelligent person I've ever been in the same room with. I took Philosophy of Vision and Imaging with him. I found it very challenging and very rewarding. He moves extremely fast through the material. Take lots and lots of notes! I learned a lot because of him. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy	210	2	4	4	3	480304	5/31/07	Very big on lectures, but he stimulates responses from the class well. I didnt have a hard time taking notes in his class, he kinda stresses the important points. Papers were challenging and he seemed a little biased on his views. But overall a very good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	4	4	480304	1/7/07	This teacher is the man. The class might be a bit boring but he sure knows how to teach. Dont fall asleep or u will miss detailed things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	1	480304	4/26/06	easily the best teacher I've had at RIT on so many levels... and I hate philosophy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	2	480304	1/28/06	Such a good professor... someone who actually knows how to teach at this school. He explains the readings so well, go can practically get away with not reading the text. If English isn't your 1st language, I could see you having a problem though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	4	480304	6/23/05	The class was harder than I was expecting but he is a very good professor. He had quite a few lame jokes and some funny ones too, but you could never tell when he was being serious or joking around. The class was rarely dull and the only times I felt like dozing off wre only because I had too little sleep the night before. Highly Recommended!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	1	Philosophy		2	3	2	1	480304	4/6/05	For and intro class this guy is a little over the top. I think he stretches a little to make things fit together and he just drags us along for the ride. If you have another option, take another professor. You can know what you're doing and still only snag a C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	4	480304	1/31/05	The best teacher I've had so far at RIT. He explains things _extremely_ clearly, intelligently, and articulately. He has a good sense of humor and tries his hardest to make sure everyone in class knows what's going on. Great guy, wish I knew him outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Engstrom	4.2	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	4	480304	11/1/04	Professor Engstrom is one of the most inspiring and throught-provoking teachers I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Dugas	1.8	0	Computer Science		5	1	2	1	907844	1/26/07	The class is easy, she tests the absolute basics because she knows nothing more. If you want to actually learn something which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone moving on with more cs take a different class or read the book or ask someone who knows the language. all these will help you more than she will.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Dugas	1.8	0	Computer Science		4	2	2	4	907844	10/31/06	very friendly and tells good stories, but awful not only at teaching computer science but also at knowing computer science in general. take the class for a fairly easy grade but not if you actually want to learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		1	1	3	4	148141	1/2/13	Terrible, completely destroyed any interest I had in Computer Science. I switched majors after taking his class because you don't really get taught how to code so you need experience if you want to go anywhere in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	3	148141	3/14/11	CS Theory: No, just no. He read from the slides, but aside from knowing what all the greek letters meant, he didn't understand his own homework problems and relied solely on the slides, which didn't always display the symbols needed to understand what he's saying. Later in the course the material becomes more complex, and you WILL get lost in his c
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	2	148141	1/25/11	He was great for Comp Org. He did read slides like people say, but he is clearly very passionate about what he does; If you listen, you can get a lot out the lecture. His tests are fair and fairly graded compared to other professors. He's flaky on getting assignments back and announcing due dates though. I'd recommend him for CompOrg.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science	263	3	2	2	5	148141	10/9/10	Teaches directly from Power Point, reads PP word-for-word. Very dry, not helpful outside the classroom as he tends to be very cryptic. Not enthusiastic, makes computer science a chore.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	3	148141	11/14/09	Extremely boring, teaches purely through slides, next to no classroom interaction. Outside of class he was not very helpful. Grades are based off of 3 exams, 2 projects, and a final. The exams test mostly on vocab than on concepts, which wouldn't be too bad if there weren't 100's of slides of potential vocab words. I wouldn't suggest this prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science	263	5	1	3	3	148141	4/15/09	Awful, boring, not helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	1	Computer Science		5	2	3	4	148141	10/30/08	He teaches with very dull powerpoints (plain white and all text), and is a bit monotone. He is not hard though and the hardest part of the class is not falling asleep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science	231	3	2	1	3	148141	1/30/07	Did not understand his lectures. Teaches subjects after you are required to know them for labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	1	Computer Science		2	3	3	1	148141	7/26/06	Teaches right from the slides, so you have all the notes (albeit it's really boring). The book he just started using is horrible - his slides help explain things better. He's not an easy grader, and his tests are especially tough. Homeworks and projects are appropriate though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	1	Computer Science		3	2	3	3	148141	10/20/05	Guy can put u to sleep with his power points and monotone voice (eventhough its a night class) but with out the power points he a good teacher. the quiz can be easy if u just do the labs and the tutorials
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	148141	11/16/12	No. Stop. Don't take him. He just reads slide after slide and only explains a few things. You think he is easy and laid back at first, until the first exam comes around you don't know anything. Avoid him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science	341	4	2	2	2	148141	2/12/11	Seems like a really nice guy, but isn't much of a teacher. Teaches directly from slides. Actual due dates may or may not match schedule. Although as long as you turn stuff in eventually, it'll probably still get a 100. Also, he fell asleep while I presented in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science	341	4	1	2	2	148141	1/12/11	Reads slides word for word. Lectures are very boring. It appears that many of the lectures are borrowed from other professors or sources. Don't expect to get your grades back anytime soon. Fell asleep many times in class during students presentations. It would appear that he does not want to do his job.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	5	148141	4/17/10	Duncan is terrible for OS1, I have had him for other classes and he was great, but OS1 he was awful. He didn't tell us when projects were assigned, the due date on the schedule and on the assignment didn't match, the project description was vague. When student's asked questions he wasn't able to answer them, even seemed annoyed by questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		5	4	4	4	148141	10/20/09	Great professor! Tests are fairly easy, there is always a bonus question. Little to no homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science	232	4	4	5	4	148141	1/28/09	Skilled for the skilled, smart to the intelligent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	1	148141	11/19/07	Nice guy with a dry sense of humor. Definitely monotone but at least made attempts to joke around in class. Quizzes weren't too bad but occasionally covered things we'd barely glanced over. Very fair with points on them though-- and I could always argue my way to more credit for my code. Also always had an extra credit logic question on them!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	148141	1/7/07	I took CS 1 wih him its is so easy, his quiz are extremely easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	3	4	4	148141	10/31/05	Presented the material on power points, easily puts you to sleep but doesn't mind if you fall asleep or do homework in his class, his tests can be a little rough cause he'll ask questions about minor things briefly covered, nice guy, trys to be funny, tells some pretty good stories from industry, overall not a bad professor but not great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	1	Computer Science		3	2	4	1	148141	10/20/05	he was alright but his damn power points be puttin me to sleep. and its a 6pm class so u no i wasnt tired going into the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	148141	10/14/05	Was a funny but very dry professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	NULL	148141	5/14/04	sooooo boring, he may know his stuff, but if he doesn't take the fun out of cs and drain the life from you while you listen to him, i don't know who will.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	NULL	148141	4/7/04	Duncan was very unhelpful, and from the outside seemed quite uneducated. Never worked as a programmer! Simply a very poor teacher and an extremely unforgiving unfair grader. Stay away at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	NULL	148141	4/14/03	Attendance isn't required and he posts all the material to the web so you can make up a day you missed. Labs are alright, but can require a decent chunck of your time. Tests aren't hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	5	148141	2/18/05	Not the best teacher, but funny. Tests can be a little rough. Very responsive to students. Careful if you have him for lab though, he can't work a unix box very well. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	NULL	148141	5/8/04	Thought this professor was great, definately boring, but he did know his stuff. I would suggest him, he is sarcastic so if he seems mean, he probably is just kidding, don't be afraid to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	NULL	148141	9/9/03	Dry wit, sarcastic. Very good teacher, just don't take his jokes personally. He'll help you if you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Duncan	2.8	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	NULL	148141	2/25/03	Really gotta pay attention if you want to pass his tests. Always spends time after lecture to help students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	914692	11/19/12	DuPre is a good professor. He clearly knows a lot about films. You will enjoy taking Film Arts with him. It is important show up the class and watch the movie and read the textbook to get good grades on quizzes. If you do that, you will get A or B easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	914692	3/22/12	I'm a senior writing this, and I had him as a freshman. Since I'm graduating soon, it's apparent to me he's the best prof I've had at RIT. I never knew there was such a world behind film, and I would take his class again if I could. Definitely look into it if you need a liberal arts class. Easy work load, and you can tell he loves to teach film.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	914692	2/16/12	Wonderful teacher. Highly suggest you take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	5	5	5	4	914692	8/20/10	Great lecturer. The most interesting professor I've ever listened to. If you read the chapter each week and watch the movie you'll do great on the quizzes. This was the easiest A ever, but this was also one of the best classes I've ever taken. It changed the way I view films.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	4	5	5	5	914692	11/18/09	Great teacher. Although cocky at times he knows what he's talking about. Can't seem to figure out how to navigate through DVD Menus though. I would recommend taking his class. Essays are easy if you just look in the textbook and tests are easy as he tells you what to study for them. Careful when writing though, he's the worst grammar Nazi ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	3	914692	12/15/08	Amazing teacher, probably the best class I've taken so far at RIT. It def gives you a new perspective on films, and he always seems excited about what he is teaching in class that day. TAKE THIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	4	5	5	4	914692	10/22/08	You have the chance to take this class do it. You will not regret it. Mark Dupre is a amazing teacher who honestly is interesting in what he is teaching and this makes you become even more interested. I didn't even have to buy the text book which is $70 to do well in the course. Most of what is important he says in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	5	4	4	5	914692	1/31/07	Prof. DuPre is a great teacher. It's always a large class, so there isn't much one-on-one interaction, but the class is very interesting, and he teaches it well. Assuming you read the book (which is easy reading) you will do fine on the all multiple choice tests. The papers can be a bit trying if you don't love film, but if you do, take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	5	5	5	5	914692	11/9/06	Awesome guy, knows how to stimulate thinking on the subject of film. Not for film majors; a 'just-for-fun' class if you're interested in knowing more about film.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	914692	11/16/12	I loved his class. It was very laid back and relaxed. He was never boring, and very easy to understand. His tests, quizzes, and papers are extremely fair if you do the small amount of reading and study. Take his class! You watch excellent movies and see them in a new light.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	914692	3/5/12	Probably the best teacher I have had at RIT yet. This class is not aimed to make you an artist rather it takes more of an engineering approach to break down alot of the components to the movies. He is funny and keeps the lectures interesting. Attendance is taken each class but can miss 3 classes before it reflects on grades I actually wanted to go.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	4	5	5	5	914692	12/6/11	I had Mark for Fine Arts: Film Arts. This is a great class for anyone interested in film, even if you just like watching movies. He encourages a lot of class discussion but the lectures are big so you don't have to feel pressured. Never a boring class! He's super helpful and his essays are easy if you try. Take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	914692	4/14/10	This guy is great. He is an excellent lecturer and keeps you interested throughout the entire class. Weekly quizzes are a breeze if you watch the film and read the assigned chapter in the book. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	4	5	5	914692	2/14/09	Amazing teacher. Knows what he's talking about, expressive speaker, tests are easy if you read the book. Stay for the movies, pay attention and you'll do fine. Will often give extra credit for silly errands.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	101	5	3	4	3	914692	12/1/08	Probably an easy A, if u read the book and study. Exactly what i did, barely paid attention to class. O and we got to watch some pretty good movies as well. Overall nice guy, fair grader. Turned in 2 of my worst papers ever and still got an A on both! amazing...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	2	Fine Arts	215	5	5	5	4	914692	10/22/07	Excellent professor. Class is always interesting. Only written assignments are three easy papers. Quizzes once a week that are simple provided you have read the assigned chapter and watched that week's movie. Movie selection is excellent. Easy grade and fun class for anyone who enjoys movies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Dupre	4.7	1	Fine Arts	215	3	3	2	4	914692	1/31/07	DuPré was a wierd guy. Uses different sayings like, "butter wouldn't melt in his mouth" and "potty trained too early". Gives three tests, three papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing	301	2	5	5	4	1052886	4/1/13	I loved Laurie, she was interested in knowing everyones name and making the class fun. The marketing project/presentation was a lot of work but I learned a ton and she was awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing	105	4	4	4	4	1052886	2/27/12	A bit more memorization and a little less use of skills and ideas than I generally like, and the online homework setup had a lot of vague questions that led to some low homework/quiz grades, but overall not a bad teacher. I've had better, but I've also had FAR worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing		2	5	5	5	1052886	10/18/11	Professor Dwyer is an amazing professor. Yes, she sees through peoples' crap and will call you out on it. But, if you want to truly learn about marketing, not to mention professionalism, from one of the most knowledgeable professors at RIT...take a class with Dwyer. You will not regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	0	Marketing		1	1	2	4	1052886	10/25/10	just...bad
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	0	Marketing	105	4	2	2	4	1052886	5/23/10	terrible professor - only HER way or opinion is right. don't bother thinking for yourself in a field like marketing that should be free thinking - only what she thinks counts. gives no real guidance along the way and doesn't let you know what she expects. if you really want to learn, don't take a class with her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	1	Marketing		2	1	4	4	1052886	8/21/08	This was her first time teaching MMP. Having the pressure to follow Tyler's footsteps while creating her own, she was able to fulfill both. Definitely both sides (her students and herself) had learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	1	Marketing		3	3	3	2	1052886	5/6/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	1	Marketing	762	4	2	3	2	1052886	5/22/12	her classes are only based on case discussion, mostly cases about small company marketing failures, and it does not contribute to the overall marketing knowledge so much. She made me quit marketing as my concentration. She might probably give good grades to natives.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	1	Marketing		2	3	2	5	1052886	11/10/11	Vague expectations, hard tests, requires you to memorize material rather than understand it. She knows a lot, but doesn't prove it, b/c many class exercises and projects rely on the class/student to come up with strategies and extrapolate. I did not feel there was an emphasis on research, and some of the projects were ridiculous and tedious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing		1	4	3	4	1052886	5/8/11	Professor Dwyer is intimidating, but helpful. She really pushes you to learn through 4 projects (2 team-based), and 3 tests. Her tests are kind of hard, but if you study her review packet then you'll do fine. I never had a problem with her and thought she was quite good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing	450	4	5	5	4	1052886	9/27/10	Great Professor. Good lectures. Is clear with her presentation. Helpful outside of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurie Dwyer	3.4	2	Marketing		2	4	4	3	1052886	1/27/10	She's a great professor. Relies on the textbook a lot and tests are HARD! But if you study and do the work, and go to class you'll be fine! Not an easy A.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	2	Science		2	5	3	3	133184	11/18/11	I took Fourier Method for imaging science with him this fall.The course was pretty tough.You need to read several books if you would like to answer the H.W. He's tough and the course is tough as well , and makes things complicated.But with your hard work you can beat him and his course :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	0	Science	733	1	2	2	4	133184	2/17/09	He clearly knows what he is talking about, but does a lousy job of teaching it to other people. The material covered is too much for just 10 weeks, and the homework assignments expect you to have mastered things taught within the last week or not taught at all. Tests are difficult and require memorization of everything. Learned nothing useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	0	Science	712	1	2	2	4	133184	6/23/06	20-hour homeworks that go nowhere; does his best to prove what an idiot you are.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	1	Science		2	3	2	3	133184	1/27/05	WHAT A BORE! I couldn't help myself from falling asleep in EVERY class. He rambles on and on and barely ever gets to the point. He is very knowledgeable, but just has a tough time getting the info across to the students. Tests were graded very strictly and the labs take FOREVER.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	2	Science		2	4	4	3	133184	5/1/10	Don't know why his ratings are so low. If you ask for help he will spend as much time as needed to make sure you understand the material. Homeworks are hard but follow the lecture material as do the tests. If you don't do the homework expect to fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	0	Science	433	2	1	2	3	133184	4/22/07	Homework on information that was never taught. Doesn't cover anything useful in class. Stubborn and stuck up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	1	Science		2	3	2	5	133184	5/16/05	SUPER boring lectures. honestly i felt like sleeping everyday. maybe they were boring bc all the info seemed either too obvious or over our heads. tests were hard and graded stricty. labs were too, but you could rewrite them. perhaps it was the teacher, or the material. nothing personal, but this class was definitly not the greatest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Easton	2.8	2	Science	716	2	3	4	NULL	133184	2/17/03	Great teacher, tough course, very challenging
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan  Eddingsaas	2.0	0	Chemistry		1	1	3	1	1796549	2/6/13	Dr. Eddingsaas is a nice guy. Bad teacher. He's so smart that he cannot understand why his pupils do not understand. Only gives 1 example for each type of problem. It will ruin the grades in your other classes. The homework is not helpful, too hard, and often wrong. Avoid like the plague (even tho u need the class D:)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	1	History		3	3	3	2	14402	5/17/12	She talks way too much, goes off on tangents. She grades really harshly because she thinks that all students should have the same writing abilities that she does. She did give out two extra credit assignments though. Wouldn't take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	1	History		4	2	3	5	14402	11/10/11	She is very passionate about baseball, so it makes the class more fun. The textbook is useless, so I'm glad it's cheap. The only problem I had is that she talks the entire time, and if you miss a point or a name, you're screwed on the notes. Hopefully she gets a study guide. We always got out early, which was awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		4	3	4	5	14402	3/6/11	She knows what she's talking about but goes off on tangents and can get quite boring with the lectures - she just speaks with no visualizations - as much as I am a die-hard baseball fan. Women teaching baseball - don't know how I feel about that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	0	History	507	3	2	2	1	14402	11/12/08	She graded us based on our writing ability, not on our understanding of the material. This is History, not writing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History	305	4	4	4	5	14402	10/25/06	Had her for American History:History of Baseball. She knows her stuff well, obvious red sox fan(though i didn't mind as i hate the yankees anyways). Grades pretty easy, oppertunites for extra credit, class doesn't usually last the full time, decent professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		3	5	5	5	14402	1/28/05	classes are discussion-oriented, very involved with interesting readings and field trips. interesting and intellectually challenging but it's not difficult to stay on top of material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		5	5	5	NULL	14402	6/18/03	She is awesome. I loved going to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		4	4	4	NULL	14402	1/6/03	long classes but easy grading, hottie
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		4	4	5	NULL	14402	11/26/01	can be boring...but is easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		4	5	5	NULL	14402	9/10/01	sense of humor actually makes a history class interesting and enjoyable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	0	History	305	3	1	2	4	14402	11/28/11	Was so excited to take this class. She just talked the whole time and went on tangents. Wasn't helpful at all and winded up hating the class. Don't suggest a class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History	305	4	3	5	4	14402	10/11/11	Awesome Teacher, have her for Hist of Baseball, really energetic and really into the material, class requires little work, but goes over a ton of information, great teacher for a great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History	101	2	5	5	5	14402	8/29/09	I loved her as a teacher, I took two of her classes, American History in Disabilities and Deaf history in the US. She was very interesting when she spoke and knowledgeable and always available for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	1	History		4	2	3	4	14402	10/21/08	She's pretty biased in her essays. She only offered two essays, all were worth 30%, the remaining 10% was participation. First two essays, my opinion conflicted with hers and I got a C. The last essay, I changed my opinion to conform with hers and I got a B. It kind of says something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		5	5	5	5	14402	2/9/06	I'm taking her again next year!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	1	History		3	2	4	NULL	14402	6/24/03	Very knowledgable in history. Her classes tend to be long, and most times boring, but she has a wealth of information to share. Grading is pretty easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	0	History		2	1	3	NULL	14402	5/8/03	Hated this class. She is totally type A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	2	History		4	5	5	NULL	14402	3/31/02	thinks she knows it all...NOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Edwards	3.7	1	History		4	3	3	NULL	14402	10/28/01	Not very interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	1	Mathematics		5	2	4	5	639158	1/9/11	Very easy if you keep up to date with the subject matter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	639158	6/23/10	Very big on the details on how his class works. I liked calc but he made me hate it and a class that was originally 40 students ended up with only 9 to finish the course. STAY AWAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	4	639158	10/14/09	Collects homework, and grades for correctness. Gives a quiz everyday that is pretty much unrelated to the homework. Takes forever to grade exams. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	639158	12/23/08	Probably the worst teacher I have ever had. UT needs to fire this guy before things get worst.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	639158	4/14/08	TERRIBLE TEACHER. Good at math, but BAD as a teacher. Expects you to get it right away. He takes off points for not doing the problem the EXACT way he does it. AVOID HIM!!! Save yourself from an F!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	639158	4/2/08	Worst teacher ever, I can not believe that they let him teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	3	639158	3/4/08	Very difficult teacher. Had him for Calc II and we started on chapter 8 of the book instead of chapter 5 like we were supposed to. Since math builds on things from previous chapters, it was nearly impossible, especially with quizzes every day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	4	639158	12/5/07	Tests were not similar to homework or quizes, turns an easy subject (linear algebra) into a very complicated class, avoid if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	639158	11/26/05	He made this class way harder than what it really was. He was not a good professor for Linear Algebra.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	2	639158	11/1/10	Moves quickly and has bad handwriting. Takes attendance daily with mandatory quizzes, kicks people out for texting in class (auto -2% to semester grade). AVOID THIS PROFESSOR.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	639158	10/22/09	one of the worst professors i've ever had. expects you to know everything and understand it all right away. may be a smart man, but a horrible teacher. quizzes and exams are very different from homework and classwork. watch out!!! and if you have him, do not text in class or he will freak out! HORRIBLE!!! UT needs to get rid of him!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	3	639158	3/25/09	He knows what he's doing, but he can't teach it well to anyone else. WATCH OUT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	639158	5/12/08	I just had this teacher for Linear Algebra & Numerical Methods. Do not take this prof, even if you have no other choices this semester, just wait until next semester to get another option. This was the worst math teacher I have ever had at UT. I had to purchase another book and read the entire thing cover to cover to pass this class b/c the book he
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	2	639158	4/14/08	NOT VERY GOOD
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	639158	3/24/08	This guy is by far the worst teacher I've ever had. He'll spend 30 minutes doing one problem, expecting you to get it right away. Quizzes everday, and not only are they very hard and nothing like the HW, but he only gives you enough time to get about halfway done. His grading is overly critical as well, avoid him at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	639158	2/4/08	What a horrible professor. Gives quizes every day which are way harder and are not similar to the homework in any way. He will take off points for not following his exact formatting rules on quizes and tests, and will even take off points for not formatting your work his way. It is better to not take the class than to take it with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	639158	5/5/06	I was in his class for one day, and then dropped out of it. Hint: DONT TAKE HIS CLASS. He doesn't explain anything. He may be good at math, but sucks as a teacher. He should not be on a tenure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	639158	8/25/05	this guy is terrible. He teaches from a powerpoint and doesn't explain himself at all. I wouldn't suggest that you take a class with him. Also, accent is a little to thick to understand what he is really talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed El-Bialy	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	3	639158	7/6/05	Most of the class time is group work among the students and he teaches using an overhead and powerpoint slides. His teaching is not very clear for those of us who are not Einsteins.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khodr Eldakrouni	2.0	0	Information Technology	421	4	1	3	5	828855	6/3/07	Lectures are simply showing you the PowerPoint slides, pointing at the words, and moving his finger across the screen as he reads word for word. If you ask him to explain what any of it means, he can't answer and defers it to other students who seem to know more than he does. Not good at explaining what he wants. On the other hand, easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics	305	1	1	2	2	16924	1/24/13	My impression was that he did everything to have the least amount of work for himself. The class did badly on a test, he never went over it, said "lets forget about it." I have doubts he even graded our final. Tests were never on what he said they were going to be. Awful, unhelpful. Did end class an hour early all the time. Literally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	4	16924	11/20/11	Laid Back Professor and has his funny moments. Not the most clear; softly spoken, handwriting gets smaller as he writes, misspells & doesn't really label. Doesn't really care if you don't care. HW is online. He's kind of big on respect, be on time and turn off cell phone/computer (he makes a big stink about it). Exams are usually about 4 questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	16924	6/5/11	Engel is my favorite teacher so far at RIT. He's very laid back, funny, and approachable, but he won't hold your hand. He gives a lot of homework, but if you put in the work you'll definitely get an A. He's very engaging; he actually solves his example problems with you, he doesn't just read the steps off an index card. I highly recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	16924	10/29/10	He fired his TA halfway through the quarter leaving us w/o a TA for a few weeks. He leaves the room during labs to walk around outside. He wrote "terrible" on my test, when I got an 85. He makes you feel stupid when asking a question, very limited office hours, refused to help on the labs, and teaches the lab materials after the lab. DON'T RECOMEND
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	16924	10/20/10	I could write a bunch of comments right here, but it would be very redundant. Any poor rating said about this guy so far, all the bad ratings, are all 100% true, I don't need calc to know that! He is VERY bad! Mean and a bad professor with bad grading and hours of homework a week. Look, i hate him so much I raged about him anyways! BE WARNED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics	282	3	4	2	4	16924	10/12/10	hes really funny. but along with this he moves thruogh topics quickly and he is sometimes unclear. but overall i like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	3	16924	2/26/10	One of the oddest teachers I've had, especially in the beginning of the quarter. Some of his lectures were a little hard to follow and he doesn't follow the same variable notation the book uses even though he uses examples from the book. Easy grader, homework is optional, but recommended as the tests are similar to the problems assigned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics	103	1	1	2	4	16924	2/5/09	Workshops are insanely difficult. Tests are not related to homework. Homeworks are about 70 problems/week and are also unrelated to lecture material. Avoid at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics	283	1	2	1	1	16924	12/3/08	Avoid if you can!seriously!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	16924	10/23/08	One of the worst teacher's I have had. They say college professor's are there to help, but I get the impression that this guy wants you to fail unless you're a genius. He's a hard grader. If you answer his questions correctly, you'll feel fine, but if you answer incorrectly, you get a very sharp "No" and it just makes you feel dumb.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics	328	1	1	1	3	16924	9/2/12	Very limited office hours and unhelpful during mentioned. Class pace is slow but lets students out early. Seems more concerned on students not using electronic devices. Homework is only online. Tests consist of 4-5 problems but gives little to no partial credit. The list goes on...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	3	16924	7/4/11	I really dislike RIT's PB calc sequence, but Alejandro was simply awful. Nearly all of his activities were not doable until we were taught in the following lecture. His exams are fairly easy and he gives quite a bit of leeway though. I already took AP so I don't know if you should take my word but he gives massive extra credit so an A is easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	16924	2/4/11	He is one of the worst math professors here. Expect to teach yourself calc if you don't know all the topics already. Runs through things and never explains why things happen, he expects you to already know why. Very impatient and his craftsmanship is poor, to say the least. You can't read his notes and they have no reasoning. Tests only have 4 ques
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics	282	5	4	4	4	16924	10/27/10	I like this guy. Nice, simple, easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		5	3	3	4	16924	10/20/10	He has a very easy grading scheme and tells you exactly what will be on tests. As long as you study and are decent at math Diff Eq will be a breeze. He is a really cool guy as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics	420	2	4	2	3	16924	4/28/10	Very difficult to understand, teaches from book, and seems to not have a good understanding of material. But, he is very approachable, book was an e-book(free but old), hw was not mandatory. Tests were 2-4 questions. Had to go to all his office hours to understand(hard class + bad instruction). Also had to ask a lot of specific questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	4	16924	2/9/09	hes not as bad as everyone says, hes a nice guy and is willing to extend homework assignments and such. Tests are not too hard, its all relevent to what we did in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	16924	2/2/09	He tries to scare you to leave his class, and tells everyone that his idol is Dr. House. Comes to late to lecture and workshop consistently. He has dyslexia and makes mistakes which isn't very good if you don't already know the material. If he doesn't like you, you won't get partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	4	16924	11/8/08	Terrible professor. Avoid at all cost. He WILL NOT help you if you have a question about something he's teaching. His office hours are so few and far in between he might as well not have them. Is totally unwilling to meet with students outside of his office hours as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	4	16924	10/16/08	An okay professor. He tries to be helpful, and is moderately successful. He is difficult to understand sometimes, due to poor explanations and a habit to not speak clearly. The homework complicates efforts to do well. It does not match what is gone over in class and tends to be overly difficult and unhelpful as a study guide (plus it's WebAssign).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	16924	7/27/08	I found Engel very difficult to understand. He had a tendency to mumble. Coupled with the accent, it was very difficult. His inclass examples often didn't relate to homework or exams, and at times grew frustrated when people asked him for clarification.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	1	16924	2/4/08	TONS of homework. The examples he does in class are usually nothing like the ones on the homework, so it's very frustrating. However, he's a very caring professor. He always asks how you're doing after you've been sick and tries to help (though sometimes it just confuses you more).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics	272	4	4	3	4	16924	2/7/07	A great professor. I had taken Calc in high school before, but he presents it better than my other teacher did. If you do the homework, you are certain to do well in this class since he pulls a lot of the questions from problems in the homework or similar types of questions. Can be a bit difficult to understand though because of accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	4	16924	10/27/06	I didn't lik ethis guy. He cannot teach and when he is giving examples in class, he messed up while solving them. Hes a very boring guy and makes it worse by writing small and not reading what he is writing. Try to avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	16924	4/30/06	He is awesome and gives tests once a week and usually drops the two lowest grades workshops are hard but he is usually pretty easy. Homework is usually the odd ones so if u dont know how to do it then you can check in the book usually
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	3	16924	12/1/05	I had him for calc
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	3	16924	11/2/05	For a Calc class, it wasn't bad. He has a sense of humour, although strange, but he's a good guy. His accent isn't nearly so bad as other teachers here *cough* Bailey *cough* and one of his few faults is making mistakes doing sample problems on the board. HW is a fair amount and if you actually care about doing well in the class, you will.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	3	16924	10/13/05	This guy explains stuff ok, but he is quite confusing, his accent sucks, and he accidentally incorporated two different problems into one in an example on the board. He is a nice guy. His labs suck. They take forever, but we only get an hour. Basically, I'm going to try not to be in his class next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	3	16924	4/23/05	More likely to criticize you then help you, but tends to warm up to girls. Old bag is lonely.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	4	16924	2/2/05	He's teaching methods are a little dry, but he goes over everything well and does enough examples so that you understand the material. As long as you study before tests, you're fine. Although he doesn't like to help, he won't say no to you. And the grading is good, especially with the scale.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	16924	6/11/08	Bad professor and a bad person. Don't speak clearly, and chew gun while talking. makes fun of students, not in a good way. Tells student to quit the class, if they don't quit, he gets angry at you, and attack you on a personal level. messy hand writing, no one in the class understand him. More than half the class quit. He takes revenge on students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics	272	4	4	4	5	16924	2/8/07	good class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	16924	2/3/07	Engel has trouble meaning what he says and saying what he means, this creates problems on tests and during workshops. Avoid Engel if at all possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	16924	7/11/06	Dr. Engel is the man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	16924	2/25/06	Good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	16924	11/9/05	Good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	3	16924	10/25/05	I don't mind the guy. As long as you put a little time into looking at the nites after class, it's not bad. I like his dry humor too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	4	16924	10/13/05	I think this man is a ok instructor. He may not be the quickest of minds but he is a nice guy and a fair man. He makes alot of mistakes in his examples, which I think is his major fault. But he is very througho and makes sure his students understand what is going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	3	2	16924	2/23/05	The only good thing about his teaching is that he does important things in a clear, step-by-step manner. Unfortunately, his accent is hard to get past, especially when he's talking into the board, and his handwriting is messy. Good luck going for extra help, he's almost never available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics	512	3	1	1	4	16924	11/3/04	Terrible professor. I have him for numerical linear algebra, the grad students agree he's bad. Can hardly understand what he says and writes. Wouldn't be able to do well on his own tests. Ridiculously long tests considering time alotted. What's worse, he doesn't care at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	2	Mathematics		2	3	4	3	16924	11/1/04	C'mon, he's not that bad. His sneezing fits are the stuff of legend. He's a fair grader and a decent guy. He's a little dry, but he's thorough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	1	Mathematics	420	4	3	3	NULL	16924	5/4/04	Engel is boring. I hated his lectures, which usually consisted of him flipping through the text talking about the next subject. I don't think he ever made up a lesson plan in advance. He grades either really hard or easy, hard to tell which he will do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	16924	6/18/03	Terrible teacher

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	16924	11/11/03	Im amazed more students didn't drop DIffy Q with him. The man cannot teach, he mumbles, chews gum and gets examples wrong. He just gave a test last week which NOBODY finished and everyone was frustrated when time was up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alejandro Engel	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	16924	3/6/03	He is horrible. Don't even try to ask a question in his class....he'll shoot you down and make you feel like a moron. Drop his class while you can!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	2	Economics		4	5	5	2	1335907	2/8/13	In no means is class with this professor easy, but she gives you more than enough opportunities to get an A. She's very nice and actually funny and pretty relate-able. Her accent is not really an issue either. I do think she makes the class harder then it should be, but she's good at presenting the information. Exams on the other had are difficult
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	1	Economics		4	3	3	4	1335907	2/23/10	waste of time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	2	Economics	511	3	4	4	3	1335907	12/1/09	She is very helpful if your having trouble, always will see you after class if you make an appointment. Writes all the notes on the board so if you copy everthing and study her notes ou will do fine on her tests and quizes. very easy on grading will give a curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	1	Economics	211	2	3	2	2	1335907	10/27/09	I had the hardest time in this class. She makes learning economics more difficult that is actually is. She does not give back answers on quizes until after tests. Does not give helpful examples. You will get lost on the tests. I recommend not taking her if you have the choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	2	Economics		1	3	4	2	1335907	1/26/11	This class should be intended for only those with a deep history and interest in economics. There is too much information and history, and her tests cover such a broad spectrum of information that it is pretty hard to get through this class without studying for like an entire week before tests. Her teaching style is boring lectures, but it does hel
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	2	Economics	211	2	5	4	3	1335907	12/2/09	She is very willing to help you if you have any question. All the key points are on the board, copy and review them after class and you will do fine in the test. Also an easy grader, uses curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayse Erdogan	3.6	1	Economics		1	3	2	3	1335907	11/3/09	TEACHER is new ! is hard to understand sometimes and she does make the class alot harder than it should be ! gives out 3 quiz's and 3 test's THATS it no in class work nothing ! so attend class and be there for the quiz or you will not do good !
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	0	Philosophy	101	1	1	3	1	567834	2/16/12	Guidelines for assignments unclear, no tests or quizzes to check your progress, doesn't grade assignments until it's too late. When asked for clarification, he only offered a very rudimentary explanation. Would not recommend; avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	0	Philosophy	217	1	1	3	1	567834	5/11/10	Could be the worst teacher I've ever had. Didn't grade anything until after the last day to Add/Drop. He thinks he's way smarter then he is. Not recommended AT ALL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	1	Philosophy	219	4	2	3	1	567834	5/25/09	He was an okay teacher. He introduced a new version on how to do an argument and never went into explanation of it. A lot of people in my class had this trouble with him because they didnt no exactly what he was looking for. He also did not grade everything until the last day of finals week. I based my final on prior work(that wasnt graded)it hurt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy	217	3	5	5	5	567834	2/9/09	Ethics in the Info Age is an amazing class. Once you catch onto his format for Evals, Arguments and Discus Posts; youll have a blast. Only meet once a week for 2 hours. Only bad thing I have to say is this quarter he has been very slow grading stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	567834	5/22/07	This class was great. You only go to the classroom once a week the other day you meet online.Make sure you do your arguments on time. Read the material for the quizzes. Go to the discussions and label your responses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		5	3	5	3	567834	1/12/07	Ethics in the Information Age... not a bad class. Fabio isn't a terrible professor, but he's not very convincing. His bread & butter class focuses on getting students to respect digital rights, and become aware of them. He's an easy grader. Should be an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	0	Philosophy		3	2	2	1	567834	10/4/06	not that good of a prof honestly, way too picky about his arguments. First test the class average was in the 60's, hes kinda boring and doesnt usually give a break. lots of dry reading. the arguments you have to write each week are interesting but the way he grades and the format of the articles makes it really boring to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	567834	2/8/06	GREAT GUY! Funny as hell and lets great debates happen in class. Takes awhile to respond via email but otherwise, very easy class. Attendance is not required, all work is submitted online. You can fail both exams and easily get a 75 in the course. If you arn't happy with a grade you can revise it for a better grade. EXCELLENT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	567834	2/9/05	Great guy! Interesting, Not Hard class Ethics for the Info Age is cool stuff, Awsome class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	0	Philosophy	211	1	1	2	1	567834	1/26/12	Did not show any grades for assignments untill it was too late. I don't advise having him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	1	Philosophy	217	3	2	3	1	567834	10/27/09	not very lenient. spent a weekend in the hospital, wouldnt accept my late work. lectures are not mandatory, and are usually boring. does not go very far into the material, and expects you to figure out his expectations. is not very punctual when grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy	217	4	4	5	3	567834	4/21/09	I think he is a great teacher. If his lectures weren't as interesting as they were, I wouldn't wake up for this 8am. That said, all of the work he has you do is on myCourses, and the assignments are quick and dirty. Only makes you show up one day out of the week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy	217	3	3	5	3	567834	10/21/08	He is a Great teacher except he focuses mainly on Online work. You have to write and read alot. 90% of the work is on MyCourses
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy	217	4	4	4	2	567834	2/7/07	Good professor, but I personally found this class to be very boring. Only took it because its a requirement. Very easy though and should be an easy B at worst.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	5	567834	10/25/06	Easy class, does not require you to come to class assignments done online I was a little confused about the format he wanted at 1st and when he noticed that we had a very helpful workshop that raised all of our grades. Very fun guy however some of his lectures (when he has them) can be boring if you arent interested in the subject. A+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	0	Philosophy		3	2	2	3	567834	3/20/06	He was awful. He not only screwed up my grade during the course of the class he also incorrectly submitted my final grade. He is unclear with his assignments and turns the class basically into an independent study course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fabio Escobar	3.6	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	1	567834	3/8/05	VERY easy if you do everything he requires you to do.. I got an A in his class! all the work is done online, but you got to show up in class to score participation points in discussions held by him. has a south american accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science	485	2	1	1	3	126922	3/13/12	An old school professor that likes to combine many supplementary sources into lectures. Class exams were okay if you are able to learn the material on your own. Lectures are dry and disorganized. Expect a high work load. Spends way too much time on procedure. The syllabus was about 26 pages long...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	2	3	126922	11/15/09	Might as well not teach based on how much he uses the book. Unreasonable and has ridiculous amount of rules( will NOT take a paper if it isnt stapled 100% correctly and then -50% late penalty.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	126922	5/20/07	I don't see what the big deal is. I thought he was very straight forward and clear. I can see how some would say he's boring, but I don't see it. He's a fair grader, and gives partial credit. He is picky on little things, but that's him. He's a B+ to an A professor, only students who want a spoon fed grade complain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	2	126922	9/21/06	Just terrible. How did he get tenure?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	1	126922	7/26/06	Seriously, just avoid him...all he does is complain for hours, and put people to sleep. And, he's really anal about assignments being absolutely perfect the way he wanted them, or you'd pretty much barely pass. Just stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	2	1	2	126922	3/2/06	OH MY - it was a challenge not to fall asleep in class witht his guy rambling on and on. Terrible professor, doesn't teach very well. You'll do fine if you already know CS, but if you don't, don't bother taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	2	Computer Science		3	3	4	2	126922	10/14/05	Tough professor, good advisor.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	126922	1/27/05	The only thing this class was good for was catching up on my sleep. It was inevitable that half the class would be sleeping 15 minutes into class. Does not get the point across at all, rambles on and on about things that don't have to do with the class material at all. AVOID THIS MAN! Horrible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science	101	1	1	1	1	126922	9/4/10	Very Rude & Cold Personality! just hope that you don't get into trouble & have to go to his office - whether assignment issue or CS related issue, because he will not listen to you and will only tell you his opinion of you. My advise, avoid him at all costs! I have yet to hear from a CS student who is in good terms with him or remotely liked him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	2	126922	12/12/07	Hank is overall not a bad guy. He just has a strange personality. He likes to show off how much he knows, which makes him seem like an ass. He, however, isn't horrible at teaching and you can easily pass his class with a B or an A if you can handle boredom everyday.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	126922	11/12/07	I hate his presence and I have no idea how he became the head of the CS department. I almost left RIT because of this guy's rudeness and behavior. If you are unfortunate to be in CS department - just avoid him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	126922	3/18/07	Worst professor ever, this guy pissed me off so much that I dropped out of RIT in anger.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	3	126922	8/8/06	Terrible professor/teacher/lab instructor. He basically decided to do an experiment with us in terms of grading and lab work, and had us suffer for it's demise. I did my best to switch labs before he could ruin my grade too much. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	2	1	5	126922	4/27/06	I have nothing against him personally, but he's a terrible professor. Also had him for an advisor, and while he's better, he motivates by negative reinforcement. Do yourself a favor and AVOID HIS CLASSES!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	3	126922	11/29/05	Don't take him for any reason at all.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	2	126922	8/12/05	I've heard many CS class horror stories, but he wasn't too bad for Pro Comm. Yes, he is incredibly nit-picky and if you don't do exactly what he says, he'll get pissed and give you a lower grade, but if you do your best to stick to his "standards" and do the work, you'll be fine in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	2	1	4	126922	9/13/04	Totally dry and boring. Maybe he knows his stuff but he sure doesn't present it. He thinks that teaching involves handing out sample code and letting you decipher it while he rambles about the grading standards and coding standards. Awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	NULL	126922	8/23/04	I had him for CS1 & 3. I can't say I learned a great deal of material in his class, but I picked up stuff when I was programming in lab or by going online (java.sun.com). He tries to be funny, but you have to understand his humor. He's an easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	1	NULL	126922	3/6/04	dont take his class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	NULL	126922	11/11/03	before applying to rit i met with him. he told me i wasn't going to get into the school, that i wasn't special and more or less that i was going to fail at life. He's not the nicest person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	NULL	126922	7/15/03	Very good, knows his materials, and is always availiable to help students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		1	3	2	NULL	126922	5/21/03	I've heard he's been nicer since he had some mental breakdown, don't know if that's true or not. All I know is that his lectures are very hard to follow, he doesn't get the point across at all, although he does go into more detail then others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	2	Computer Science	351	4	4	3	NULL	126922	2/26/03	very boring but not funny at the same time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	NULL	126922	2/11/03	He is the rudest man I have ever met.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		3	2	1	NULL	126922	5/6/04	Etlinger should not be a professor. I'm sure if he had a job outside of academia, he'd be a perfectly normal, contributing member of society, but HE CAN NOT TEACH. Most of the material I learned from friends outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	NULL	126922	2/16/04	This guy is going to hell or something. If you have him, may god have mercy on your soul.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	NULL	126922	8/3/03	I will be honest with you. 100% honest. When I think about what I can relate this mans class to, I think about what it must be like to be rolling around in a DRY desert of chalk dust. Things I suggest bringing to his class: a pillow, nyquil.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	NULL	126922	6/19/03	This man is the reason I switched to IT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hank/henry Etlinger	2.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	NULL	126922	3/11/03	The rudest, most unhelpful teacher i have ever had. He started off the class by saying These are my office hours, but dont come, becasue i'm too busy to see you

Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	0	Biology		3	1	1	1	102778	11/12/11	Very unorganized and repeats the same information every lecture. Lab is chaotic and nothing ever works. Exams are difficult because you have no idea what is going to be on them. Probably the worst professor I've had in my 4 years.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	0	Biology		3	1	1	5	102778	8/7/10	Very difficult to work with. Was inconsistent and inconsiderate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology	333	4	5	3	4	102778	5/29/10	Super nice, super helpful, rather disorganized. Lets you take a one page "cheat sheet" into tests and work in pairs on quizzes. Easy A if you try at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		4	5	5	5	102778	10/12/05	GREAT PROF! She and Frederick are the best in the bio department!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	102778	9/7/05	Kinda goofy, but very nice, classes are a nice break from the rest of the horrible teachers they have in the bio dept
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		5	5	5	NULL	102778	5/27/04	Couldn't have made it through this school without her help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		4	5	4	5	102778	9/6/11	Dr. Evans is an amazing Researcher. Slightly disorganized and sometimes needs a push to get moving. Always helpful and always willing to listen. Loves her research and learning. She loves to share her knowledge. Honestly, she is the best professor I have had the privilege to meet in this school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	102778	7/18/10	Not very helpful during labs, had to mostly depend on the TA, not helpful when it came to reviewing material, only good thing is the subject matter wasn't too hard to begin with, otherwise the course would have been unbearable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology	314	3	4	4	4	102778	8/22/07	Best class I have taken so far, material wise. The lectures are kind of a joke but the labs are amazing. You really learn important lab techniques that you will use in the "real world" Easy grader!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		4	5	5	5	102778	10/2/05	Wonderful actually cares if you learn something
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irene Evans	3.7	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	102778	1/27/05	Definately makes being a biotech student worth it. Her course is something you can actually look forward to; and she's incredibly helpful.

Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	4	4	4	2	820801	10/31/12	Great guy. Makes a very boring subject somewhat interesting. Pretty sure the guy is CRAZY, but he's a great professor none the less, loves students and gives you many Extra credit opportunities. Definitely recommend you take is class for any business subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	2	4	4	2	820801	10/25/11	He knows financial accounting is difficult for students to grasp so he tries to make things clear. Hes got jokes. He tells mostly relevant stories and teaches life lessons that will be useful in the future. MC tests that are easy if you understand the material. If not, the practice tests can earn you xtra credit. He knows his stuff. Good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	101	3	5	5	4	820801	4/23/11	Bill Evans is a great guy and teacher. He realizes that the material he is teaching is somewhat bland and does his best to make it entertaining while also teaching you all you would need to know. Whether you are looking to learn in the class or get goods grades with minimal studying the extra credit offered allows for either. Very fair class
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		2	4	3	3	820801	11/30/10	Took him for financial accounting. I thought he was clear on his presentations, though he does try to make corny jokes. The best thing is that you can take practice exams for extra credit and homework are easy A if you do it. The only thing I didn't like was that the practice tests didn't really have the same questions as the real tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	302	5	5	5	4	820801	11/3/10	He is an awesome Professor. Extremely funny and corny. always engaging the class with his kookiness but always keeping the class focused on work. Very helpful and sweet. I want to take him for all my Accounting classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	350	2	4	5	3	820801	7/26/10	great Professor, Corp. Finance very hard class but if you work hard you will be ok gives tons of bonus points and makes class fun and interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	3	4	4	4	820801	3/5/09	Evans is the man! He's a great person and helps you try to understand in any way he can. I took him for Management Acct., Financial Acct., and Corporate Finance and wouldn't change that! Helps if you read to fully/better understand but he's a great professor. He also gives a lot of bonus point opportunities (or money!). Take him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	401	3	4	5	4	820801	5/14/08	Great professor, highly recommended!!! Not only is he rather easy, he is nice, not boring, fun, and very helpful. 99% chance you will like him no matter what!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	5	5	5	5	820801	2/11/07	He's the best! Interesting guy; very energetic, organized, and lovess what he teaches! Not only will he get you through the class awake, but if you pay attention, you'll know what you're doing and end up with a great grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		4	5	5	5	820801	9/6/06	He was the best professor I've ever had. He kept the class motivated. He definately knew his stuff and would always help you with problems. I used to hate finance alot but now he inspired me to take it as a minor. Take his class if you really wanna learn. He can really teach you alot of stuff. You just gotta work hard..
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	4	5	5	3	820801	5/21/12	Takes a dry subject and tries to make it interesting. He's a nice guy, has a fun sense of humor and tries to connect with his students. His tests are fair, a lot of extra credit opportunities, and he's pretty lenient. Taking him is a very wise choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	3	5	3	3	820801	8/21/11	Love teaching, yes. Love making joke, yes. Love making sure everything's clear for a student who asks for clarification, yes. But for me, as a deaf student with interpreters relaying all his lectures, his jokes are very interrupting, making me confused if that's part of his teaching in FIN ACC.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	301	4	4	5	4	820801	1/25/11	Book chapters are long, but have weekend to do homework (2 chapters a week). Good guy, corny jokes. Engaging and makes sure you learn something. Good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	101	3	4	5	4	820801	11/22/10	Loved Professor Evans! Very nice guy, great teacher, fair amount of work for the course. Be prepared for his exams, they aren't identical to the pre-tests! Definitely recommended for accounting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		5	5	5	4	820801	8/27/10	If you need to take finance, make sure you take it with this guy. With the HW credit and a lot of extra credit opportunities, you can score high Cs on all 3 tests and still get an A in the course. When you take the class, he tells you to read the book 3 times, but it really doesn't help you. You really need to know how to do the problems to do well
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		4	5	5	4	820801	5/11/09	Prof. Evans is an AWESOME teacher! I took his class at 8am and I actually enjoyed going. His tests are fair and his homework is helpful. He motivated me and got me interested in Managerial Accounting. It's impossible NOT to learn with him (as long as you go to class). He's an understanding guy and he's worth taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		4	5	5	2	820801	2/4/09	Collects homework which need not be correct. Loves teaching and actually knows how to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		2	4	3	2	820801	2/27/07	doing homework doesn't help you much on the tests. however, he collects them so you are required to do them. doing his sample tests over and over again will help you be prepared for his tests. he's a nice guy, knows his accounting, and finds ways to entertain his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting	350	3	4	5	5	820801	2/9/07	If you have to take Corporate Finance, take it with Evans! He's GREAT! Really takes interest in his students and cares if you learn. May seem hard at first, but hang in there - gets easier! GREAT guy and professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		4	5	5	4	820801	4/28/06	great professor! he kept everyone awake and interested in accounting at 8am, which is a feat in itself. tests were not surprising since he gave ridiculous amounts of practice problems. he definitely wants his students to do well and it isn't hard to be successful in his class as long as you put in the effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Evans	4.6	2	Accounting		3	5	5	3	820801	3/15/06	very helpful.. he wants you to learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing	101	4	5	4	2	914760	2/20/13	Maggie is awesome, she encourages you to do your best and doesnt heavily criticize you for making mistakes. Take writing sem. with MAGGIE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	4	4	4	914760	11/20/11	Very easy class and a very easy going teacher. Grades is based on 2 essays, 2/3 page response to some sort of question and then the final is a research paper she gives you 3+ weeks to do. Only thing is she gives grades on attendance so you must go. But overall a very easy and nice teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	4	5	2	914760	10/21/11	Had her for writing seminar, class is not over yet. But she made it easy. I'm an Engineering major, writing is not my best area but it is hard to not earn an A. Show up, do you paper, and fix your mistakes (she lets you hand it in again if you did not get a high enough grade)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	5	5	3	914760	4/22/09	Great teacher. She knows that most people in the class are not liberal arts majors and she adjusts her teaching style to it. As long as you show up to class (attendance was 20%) and bring in a rough draft when she asks, it is almost impossible to not get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	1	Writing		5	3	3	1	914760	10/6/08	She just talks forever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		4	5	4	3	914760	10/24/07	Good teacher. Class is kept interesting for the most part. She knows what she is talking about. If you do your work and show up, you will be fine. Grading of essays is strict.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		4	5	5	3	914760	1/19/07	I absolutely love this woman. She genuinely cares about each of her students and is very accessible. If you get the chance to choose, take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	3	5	5	914760	5/21/12	Your grade will drop if you miss class.. But other than that she is a very easy going teacher. She gives you lots of opportunities to improve your grade. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	5	5	3	914760	11/10/11	Professor Everhart is Awesome! I'm a business major and i had to take her class. Writing isn't my strong suit, but she teaches you how to become a better writer. i learned a lot. class is 2 hours but usually only goes for about an hour. the book is useful, it will help you get good grades on all your papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing	100	2	4	5	3	914760	10/25/10	Amazing teacher, she basically says, get this this and this done and your set to go. Makes the class enjoyable and gives you the hardest stuff in the beginning of the course highly recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		5	5	5	4	914760	2/26/09	Best professor I have had so far. I would strongly recommend taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing		4	5	4	2	914760	11/6/07	An excellent professor in every respect! She is a truly caring individual and is very down-to-earth. If you have a choice, take one of her classes- you will not regret it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing	227	5	4	5	2	914760	2/5/07	easy, kinda boring but she is interested and good at teaching, she is easy to get off track and she will do it on her own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Everhart	4.4	2	Writing	502	5	3	5	1	914760	11/10/06	She was a pretty chill teacher. I really liked her and i would suggest takin her when your workload is bogus because she gives a light load
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	1203729	11/14/12	Great Professor, very helpful, in class and when you stop by his office as well. Uses WebWork which is easy to do homework with, do all works and homework and you will receive a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	5	5	1203729	5/17/12	Professor Faber is definitely one of the best professors in the math department. He has a good sense of humor and likes to throw some jokes into lecture. He teaches the material very well and his tests are actually not too bad at all since he gives a practice exam that is almost identical. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	282	1	5	3	5	1203729	10/29/10	Project Based Calc II: Great Guy; not a bad teacher, but very difficult class. I also didn't have a good teacher for calc I, but this has been my only non-A at RIT. He is better than most professors at our school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	282	5	4	4	3	1203729	2/21/10	Very nice guy. Not the easiest, but does curve the tests. Assigns a group project for 10% of the grade, which is nice padding. Always happy to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	281	5	4	4	5	1203729	10/25/09	Good guy. Big Giants and Yankees fan. Teaches the material well. Homework every week from textbook.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	1203729	2/2/09	Great teacher who is always improving (he's new this year). Challenging but give's good curves.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	281	3	5	3	3	1203729	10/23/12	Overall great professor. Very helpful if you go to his office. Could be a bit clearer on the subject matter. Quirky sense of humor. Book not really required. Borrow it from a friend or the library to do the paper homework. Uses WebWork so you don't have to pay do do the online homework. Definitely utilize his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	5	1203729	11/18/11	Such a great and intelligent teacher. Classes are never boring, make topics very clear, and very helpful!! If you can get a chance take him as your professor, you better take it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	1203729	5/19/10	This guy is the best calc professor that I have had through the project based sequence.

I will always recommend him as a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Faber	4.4	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	3	1203729	1/28/10	This is the best calc professor I've had.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	351	5	5	5	4	67400	11/15/12	By far the best Prob/Stats prof. Gives handouts for each class with examples and explanations. Daily quizzes but lowest 3 are dropped. Quizzes help you understand the material. Tests were somewhat long but he gives you a lengthy equation sheet. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	1	67400	2/8/12	Nicest prof I've met so far at RIT. He is genuinely excited about statistics and insanely smart, as he commonly points out the maker of the book is wrong,and likes to disagree with famous stats people
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	351	5	5	5	5	67400	10/22/11	He is a good professor. He explain really clearly and every day you will have a quiz but those quiz form whatever he cover and he will let let you know which one will cover. Easy and nice professor. He loves to help student. Take with him...
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	67400	11/22/10	Very nice guy. The first two exams are easy, but the final is very hard if you don't actually understand the concepts, so make sure you keep your grade as high as possible going into the final. Requires no homework, but does suggest problems to work on for better understanding. Did a pretty good job of explaining the material in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	352	5	5	4	3	67400	5/28/08	Farnsworth is the best professor in the math department. He obviously cares that his students learn and he puts in a lot of effort to help you out. He makes all old quizzes and exams going back years available online. All tests and quizzes were open book, and you can write in the book. As long as you make it to class, you will do well with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67400	1/28/07	I didn't know how to do any of this stuff before and I still don't.

Now I have to suffer through DA2
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	67400	11/20/05	nicest man you could ever meet in your life, but honestly i cant analyze data after taking his data analysis class. i memorized how to do the problems and had no idea what they mean so the final screwed me
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	5	67400	10/24/05	Great teacher! Easy to learn from and tests are simple with a little studying and effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	67400	8/12/05	Nice guy. Easy class. He hands you an A. But not in the sense that you didn't learn anything. He teaches you too...
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	NULL	67400	1/27/03	GREAT prof!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	351	5	5	2	1	67400	10/16/12	Super sweet man. Had a tough time following his lectures, very dull. Quizzes are easy if you follow the hints he gives on syllabus. Exams were long, but very easy if you did well on the quizzes. Don't be alarmed at first, he's very soft spoken, but willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	351	5	5	5	5	67400	11/29/11	He is really good teacher. I really enjoyed his class....he will help you whenever you have the question. he gives exam and quiz whatever he cover in class. good teacher....take with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	0	Mathematics	101	4	2	2	3	67400	2/15/11	His tests and quizzes are very easy, HOWEVER, he is not clear at all and you literally feel like you are learning nothing. He tells you useless information that takes away from the lesson and at times makes no sense. After the first 3 weeks I felt like I was going to die. DO NOT TAKE HIM BECAUSE HE IS EASY, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	3	67400	12/1/09	Extremely easy class but you'll learn something too. Quizzes and exams are open book and lots of review problems are given to make grades a piece of cake. If you miss a class, Farnsworth will make sure you get caught up and is willing to help you succeed. Definitely the best professor for Engineering Statistics!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics	331	5	4	3	2	67400	3/7/08	Quizzes are in nearly every class. Posts old quizzes and tests which help with the current one. Speaks softly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	67400	2/28/06	So easy...didn't do any work! DEF highly recommended!!!! Posts online tons of old quizzes and tests to help out as well. Easy easy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67400	11/16/05	Nice guy but not a good teacher at all, i know i could have done a lot better under a different teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	67400	8/12/05	He's a really nice professor, and teaches well too. Always available for help. Homework was optional and quizzes were easy, but tests were tricky...especially because he chose certain questions to be worth about half the test, and if you didn't know how to do it, you'd basically be screwed. Plus, the final was a beast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Farnsworth	4.0	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	5	67400	4/6/05	Very Easy class. He makes the quizzes just like the priactice ones on the web, just with differant numbers. Skips the Method of Moments in favor of mor Hypthosis testing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abdullah Faruque	4.5	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1445363	2/11/12	Hydraulics: clear, easy, nice, great professor. take him if you can :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abdullah Faruque	4.5	2	Engineering	220	5	5	3	4	1445363	9/7/10	A little hard to understand at first, but a great teacher. Very helpful and a nice guy. Civil Graphics class was pretty easy. Drawings can be tedious though. Go to class and stay on top of the work. Highly recommend Faruque.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abdullah Faruque	4.5	2	Engineering	404	4	5	4	5	1445363	10/8/10	Very nice guy, extremely helpful !! Took few classes with him. Power point type of lecture kind of boring, however you learn a lot. Test or quizzes are hard, tons of homework but he will do everything to just give you A. I try to take all classes with dr.Faruque.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	3	52258	2/5/08	Wonderful Teacher! Very helpful and sweet. You will learn alot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	3	52258	9/8/05	She likes to teach, which is more than can be said for many professors. She will help you out whenever she can, but assignments tend to be hit or miss; the only way to make sure to get a good grade is to put as much time into a piece as you can afford to spend, and sometimes small mistakes will lose you big points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	0	Fine Arts		5	1	1	NULL	52258	7/2/04	Only shows you one kind of art, crap. Very tedious and very boring. If it wasn't required, I wouldn't be there and neither would 90% of the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	NULL	52258	8/5/03	i dont think i remember her name.. what was it again? haha. shes got a weird way of grading too.. the less time you put into it, the better grade you get. oh and "can u please adjust the damn slides???"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	NULL	52258	2/19/03	You always know who she is, because she will tell you...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	52258	2/3/06	I absolutely loved 2D design. Eileen was one of those teachers who just makes the class awesome. She works great with students who have disabilities. I found her easy to follow and to work with. It's not easy, you will have to work your butt off, but my experience in that class makes me wish I could take 2D all over again, just to have her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	3	52258	1/24/05	she knows her stuff and explains things very clearly. very helpful critiques. i loved the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	52258	9/9/03	One of the best teachers that I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	3	4	NULL	52258	4/21/03	Don't (or do) sing C'mon Eileen to her..she hates that song.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eileen Feeney-Bushnell	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	52258	5/14/02	AWESOME teacher! One of the best I've ever had in my life! She is the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	0	Physics	213	4	1	1	4	66043	2/16/12	Not a fan of this guy at all. He tends to ramble on and on about a topic, and don't you dare ask a question. If you do, he'll misunderstand you and answer a completely different question than the one you asked. If you have any prior knowledge, the mistakes he makes in his study guides will be painful. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	2	Physics		2	4	3	2	66043	12/8/08	His study guides are his test! There is no raeson you can't get 100 on all the exams, fair amount of reviewing the study guided but does a great job of making sure the whole test is covered. He's cool with overall grading, willing to talk to you and help you get an A. I got like all 100's on the exams and never did the HW and got an A. Nice Guy too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	66043	8/19/05	hes a great teacher i love his class it was so easy i dont know how anyone said he was boring i got an a on all his test
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	2	Physics	313	2	4	5	NULL	66043	2/25/03	Great Lecture Prof, but grades like a badass
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	0	Physics		4	2	2	1	66043	10/24/11	He's a really nice old man, but he has no idea how to teach. Don't ask questions or he will confuse you more, don't let him know your name or you will get picked on. Unless you already have a strong concept of the course material before you start or a friend who can get you old exams, don't take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	2	Physics	211	3	4	3	3	66043	2/1/07	he's a really nice guy, but he does stutter and is sometimes hard to follow, i got a high B in the class for physics I, and have about the same in physics II. If he makes a mistake and you catch it, he gives you a bonus point, he's also really easy to talk to about negotiating grades, gives partial credit, super sweet guy, but not the best teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	0	Physics	312	3	2	2	NULL	66043	5/18/04	I expected a lot better, he is unclear and not very helpful. Tests are graded inconsistantly and unfairly. Also a very lazy grader, used webassign way too much, including for labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Entenberg	3.1	1	Physics		2	3	3	NULL	66043	12/10/02	Difficult and amazingly dry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Erickson	2.0	0	English		3	2	2	2	1410555	5/11/11	Took her for Career English 2 and I don't really like her. She keeps canceling classes and waste my time THEN she complains that we're behind. Maybe if she didn't cancel so many classes in the first place, we wouldn't be behind. Sometimes she doesn't grade fair and takes off too many points on little insignificant things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brooke Erickson	2.0	0	English	200	5	2	2	2	1410555	10/13/10	She canceled her class as always. She wasted my time for that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	1	Economics	101	1	2	3	3	1111364	4/28/11	I am a straight A student, after taking this class not only did my frustrations rise but i really didnt like his grading. He seems to just take points away wherever he can even if your answers are explained. I dont get this guy...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	0	Economics		2	2	2	1	1111364	4/21/11	He really is not my favorite teacher, our grade is based on 2 exams, a paper, and a final. He makes the material more confusing than it needs to be, and often stumbles over his own examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	2	Economics	211	3	4	4	4	1111364	7/14/10	I liked him. You have to learn a lot and study hard but if you do that you'll get a good grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	2	Economics		3	5	5	5	1111364	4/26/11	Great guy. Great teacher. The class was not the easiest but he is worth the extra work. 3 Tests no HW besides a small paper. He is really passionate about what he is teaching and his class got me interested in the Econ minor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	2	Economics	101	1	5	5	5	1111364	7/19/10	Dr. Espinosa's hotness is an eternity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Javier Espinosa	3.8	2	Economics	211	3	5	4	4	1111364	3/18/08	Great Professor who really knows the material. His tests are very difficult, but if you know the material you will do fine. He is also very helpful if you go to see him during his office hours. I learned a ton from is class and would take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	735	2	1	1	4	808248	11/23/10	Poor use of expensive textbook and class time. Syllabus designed to keep him up to date on industry research and case studies. Students teach the class through presentations and peer question sessions, feedback is ineligible, grades are non-numeric and purposely ambiguous (A/B) so the final grade is a matter of subjectivity and his personal bias.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	735	2	1	1	4	808248	8/18/10	Professor seemed unprepared to teach online section - did not post required readings or videos until 3-4 days prior to due date. I wrote emails asking for clarification of assignments, got 1-2 word answers back that didn't even address the issue. Couldn't read his handwritten comments on papers or exams. Learned very little. Disappointing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	102	1	1	1	3	808248	6/2/09	Avoid at all costs!! First, he discriminates against women. Second, he gives no clear direction whatsoever. After multiple emails asking for clairification on items, he proceeded with one word 'responses' that didn't even address my questions. He doesn't take the time and doesn't seem to really care at all about the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	1	Business	102	2	3	2	4	808248	12/4/08	This was part of the Executive MBA program. Dr. Ettlie is an authority in his field; however he has little skill in transmitting his ideas in a manner that is simple, clear and understandable. His teaching method is confusing and his feedback on assignments is illegible, laconic and has no added value. Overall, I was disappointed by this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	742	1	1	1	4	808248	11/15/07	I would not recommend his class. I came into class wanting to try hard, but by the end of the quarter, I just resigned myself to the realization that I will never know what he expected of me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	735	1	1	1	1	808248	10/19/10	Ettlie was awful. He provided no direction to the class and never lectured on concepts or theories. Never knew what he expected and never knew his feedback due to his awful handwriting skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	744	1	1	1	1	808248	11/8/09	As everyone here has said, avoid at all costs! Instead of teaching anything, he expects you to know everything he already knows. Extremely rude, extremely unhelpful, extremely disorganized as far as keeping track of student's grades and assignments. Smart guy, but a terrible professor. You will learn nothing in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business	102	1	1	1	3	808248	6/2/09	As mentioned by previous comments, Ettlie gives no direction and the direction that he attempts to give is useless and only causes further confusion. After multiple emails asking him for clarification on items, he still proceeded to send back one word responses that didn't even answer my questions. Avoid at all costs!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	2	Business	102	1	4	4	4	808248	8/1/08	Part of EMBA Program. Great insight on disruptive technologies. I use the theories learned often in my business.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ettlie	1.5	0	Business		2	1	2	5	808248	2/6/06	He wrote the book, but has a citation after every sentence and it's impossible to read. Expects you to do case write-ups based on his book and you can't figure out what he wants. Tough grader. His class is somewhat entertaining, but his book, assignments, and grading are not. Felt like I did not learn anything the whole quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Ann Evans	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	4	563921	11/10/05	One of my favorite professors in SPM - very clear and helpful, well-organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Ann Evans	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	5	563921	8/31/05	A fantastic professor! Knows the ins and outs of the print industry business. Lectures are funny, interesting, and always prepared. I love the british accent and the fabulous sense of wit!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Ann Evans	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	563921	8/31/05	Wonderful professor. Very effective teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Ann Evans	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	5	563921	1/31/05	Easy to listen to, doesn't make the class boring and dull. Explains everything on a level we'll understand and how it applies to our intended careers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Evenstad	5.0	2	Languages	101	2	5	5	5	1203666	11/12/08	COLLEEN IS CHAMP TEACH!! SHE IMPRESSED MY SKILLS TOO MUCH!! THAT IS MY FAVORITE ONE!! PLEASE TAKE UP THIS ONE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	2	Engineering	666	2	5	5	5	687146	5/20/11	Dr. Ewbank is one of the best professors I have ever had. In his classes you will work hard on some difficult stuff, but if you ask for help when you need it he is there to help you. In addition to being an excellent professor he is a great human being. He also raises Lammas! ask about it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	1	Engineering	221	2	2	3	2	687146	5/19/09	Homework and labs have absolutely not directions, its all a toss up. Tests have 5 questions, no partial credit and he just writes "NO" if you get something wrong and never explains why. Tends to ramble on and excepts that you know a lot of things that you don't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	687146	1/27/09	DOE is probably one of the most useful classes for your first co-op and I couldn't have asked for a better professor. The course was very well organized and tests were straight forward if you did all the homework. Ask him about his llamas.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	0	Engineering	221	3	1	1	5	687146	4/30/07	Horrible teacher, doesnt explain the class at all just hands out packets with useless info, and expects you to plug numbers into excel, dont learn a thing, and his tests are random, AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	2	Engineering	666	3	4	4	3	687146	10/2/09	You can learn a lot from this guy and it seems he enjoys helping you to learn. Labs are fun and interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	1	Engineering	221	1	3	2	2	687146	5/7/09	Assumes you know things that you really don't in lectures. Grades like a truck (very hard). Don't take it 1st year, as some things that you need to know for the class aren't learned till spring quarter of 1st year (ex: optics in physII). test questions come from left field but are easy if you actually know them. Nice guy-- apparently he has llamas.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	2	Engineering		3	5	4	5	687146	10/16/08	Professor Ewbank will teach you what you need to know and do it in style. His classes will prepare you well for industry. Plus when he grows his quarterly beard he looks just like a sea captain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Ewbank	3.4	1	Engineering	320	3	3	2	1	687146	1/19/06	The class was a lot of statistics mumbo jumbo, so it's already slightly difficult to grasp. Professor Ewbank doesn't do a very good job of clearing up what it all means, so you find yourself just plugging numbers into equations without knowing WHY you're doing it. I would certainly take the class with someone else, but he's the only only one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Farkas	2.3	2	Fine Arts	101	3	5	4	5	1065058	3/18/08	Alan is a great teacher. His classes are fun and while the assignments can be "boring" as suggested, they're the same assignments the rest of the classes are required to do. He is also very willing to meet with you through scheduled appointments via e-mail and during the 5 hour studio time assigned. He really cares for his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Farkas	2.3	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	3	1065058	10/23/07	He assumes students have plenty of money to spend. There is no having an intelligent discussion with him because he won't listen to your reasoning because you're "not as good as he is at this". He sends out important emails very late the night before class, so there's very little chance of finding out something important before class. I didn't lea
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Farkas	2.3	0	Fine Arts		4	1	2	1	1065058	12/1/07	He is only available through email and views offices hours as a waste of his time. His "lectures" are boring and uninformative. His grading is extremely biased. I'm not exaggerating at all when I say that if you don't suck up and take over conversation during crit, you will not get a fair grade. His assignments are completely disorganized and he's
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Farrar	2.0	0	Business		3	2	2	1	764941	2/12/07	There is a ton of work for this class, expect to be spending at least 10 hours a week out of class just doing the homework. The only good thing was that he allowed you to take the exams open book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena A Fedorovskaya	1.5	0	Psychology	101	1	2	1	4	1768573	4/6/13	Took her my first quarter at college, read the textbook, made 1000 flashcards (no joke) and put in way more effort that I should have had to for a 101 class. Got one of 3 A's in the class. Class average was a C.. Would not recommend taking her class. Her accent and her useless PP slides just makes it impossible to focus and excell in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena A Fedorovskaya	1.5	0	Psychology	445	2	2	2	2	1768573	2/13/13	Her psychology of perception class was the worst. Tests are hard if you do not read the book. Almost half the time the exams have nothing to do with her power points. Sometimes she doesn't really know how to explain herself well. I would not recommend this class wit her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena A Fedorovskaya	1.5	0	Psychology	445	2	1	1	4	1768573	2/18/13	I'm a a graduating biomed major and her class is like an upper level neuro-science course. She has a very heavy accent and I couldn't focus much in class because of it. Class could be interesting if you're willing to put in A LOT of time reading the book. 3 major tests no cumulative final. Some random assign. In between.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale Fennie	3.9	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	1	73694	3/11/06	She was mad cool and fun. She made the class interesting. YOu could tell she really cared about here students understanding AND mastering the material. Even tho java is a boring langugae she kinda made it fun.....great professor

Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	1	Biology		1	2	4	3	851579	5/29/12	Good teacher, but the tests are too hard. I did study for hours and hours and couldn't get up to an A, first class where that ever happened.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		5	5	5	4	851579	4/15/11	Infectious Disease: Impact on Society and Culture. My favorite course to date. Exciting and interesting. Lots of readying. Dr. Ferran is insightful and interesting. Lots of knowledge. Loves her field. So far the course is great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		3	4	5	4	851579	4/15/11	Overall course is excellent. Teacher is fantastic. I had a personal problem and she met with me several times and really helped. Compassionate and loves viruses. Study notes and keep up and you will do well. Don't study and you will have problems. After taking this class I decided to go to graduate school in infectious disease
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology	406	2	5	4	3	851579	4/15/11	Totally awesome course. Dr. Ferran goes above and beyond to help students. She really cares about us and knows her stuff. Make the material relevant and very current. Not an easy A, but you will leave a lot. I will take every class she teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	0	Biology		3	1	1	3	851579	4/4/07	According to Dr Ferran, on the first day of class, supposedly virus exits the cell from the exact spot that it entered from..sounds illogical right? looked it up, and found out she is wrong!and virology is supposed to be her expertise. she's a joke
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		2	4	5	2	851579	4/1/07	Dr. Ferran takes a great interest in what she teaches. Her lectures are very clear and concise, and she enourages questions and makes sure nobody is left behind. Her tests are moderately hard, however if you study you can get great grades in her class. Highly knowledgeable and I'd highly recommend her.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	851579	10/24/11	She's the best prof in RIT.Study hard and then you will get good grades.Students who don't study must blame Dr Ferran.her notes are highly organized and she is a great presenter of materials.I will take every class that she teaches.Plus she's a very nice person.You will leave a lot after taking her class.Take her class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	851579	4/15/11	Excellent course and professor. Exciting area and course is clear. Study all along and you will be fine. Students who don't study must have rated Dr. Ferran low. Really cares about topic and students. Kind and smart.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology		2	5	4	4	851579	4/15/11	Amazing course. So be required for all biotech majors at RIT. Incorporated almost all the courses I have taken into one. Lectures based on research articles, not textbook. Professor is excellent, cares a lot. Difficult material but students learn so much. Group work is great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	1	Biology		1	2	3	1	851579	11/19/09	Total waste of a quarter! Three tests make up your whole grade and each test has only 30 questions on it. Never able to answer questions and you are forced to schedule time with her to even look at your graded tests since she won't hand them back. Awful test questions, awful class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	2	Biology	559	3	4	5	5	851579	4/3/07	She is a very nice person and answers all questions pretty clearly. Class is very interesting and attending the lectures is a must. Exams are pretty tough, really have to study hard for them. But if you study from the beginning, then it shouldn't be that bad. Projects, posters and presentations you have to do are moderately easy. Good class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maureen Ferran	3.5	0	Biology		3	1	1	3	851579	3/25/07	She teaches virology and she will admit that she's "weak" in immunology, which i think is ridiculuos! she also does some research that deserves the golden fleece award,( meaning it's bogus). students constantly have to correct her coz she doesn't what seh is talking about half the time. she is also extremely hormonal, some times she's giddy and on
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Ferrara	2.5	1	Management		3	2	3	1	1689429	1/26/12	Got an A in her class, easy busy work. Nice lady, terrible professor. She took a class that could have been really useful and ruined it. Focuses more on teaching definitions instead of preparing students for working in corporate / business environment. HUGE disappointment and waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics	262	3	5	4	4	1252577	4/27/11	A really great Teacher. I had her in the winter and had some trouble with the material. After I started going to office hours I went from an F to a B in 5 weeks. Really approachable great with 1 on 1 always willing to make time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	4	5	5	4	1252577	2/10/11	Probably one of the best math professors at RIT. She is very helpful in class and in office hours. She doesn't collect the homework but she offers extra credit to anyone that does hand it in. The tests are based off of the homework and workshops so it is important that you do both. Take her if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1252577	11/9/10	She is the best teacher ever. Test are easy if you go over her material. A lot of opportunity to increase your grade. She is nice and always available to help you with questions. Strongly recommend for calculus for science management class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics	215	4	5	5	4	1252577	5/11/10	I had her for Calc 2 and she is a really good teacher. The material is dry, but she makes it clear for you to understand. She's also very available to talk to you about any questions. She will put in that extra effort to help you understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics	231	5	5	5	2	1252577	9/8/09	Wow, so helpful and nice to look at while I took the class. So friendly, so nice. she is willing to help if you ask and is quite availible. Prepares you quite well for tests and homeworks werent to bad, somewhat long but worth it. Prefect intro to Calc teacher.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1252577	4/19/11	Amazing teacher. Very helpful, flexible office hours. Optional homework, but test questions are straight from the homework/workshops. Very open to questions. Explains the theory, does many examples and actually lets you work them out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1252577	11/17/10	Extremely helpful, kind, and always willing to give more examples. An awesome professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	3	3	1252577	5/18/10	Easy class. I failed the first exam but then she gave so much extra credit that I somehow got an A without taking the final (Final will replace lowest grade). Very friendly teacher and very helpful. Only downside is the textbook was extremely expensive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1252577	11/3/09	Great teacher highly recommended! i feel that if she was my teacher for any class i would understand it ! Easy testing and easy lab's ! she is also easy to talk to if you need help with the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Racheal Feustel	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	4	5	4	3	1252577	5/15/09	She is a nice professor and really gets the material to stick.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ricardo Figueroa	4.7	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	4	1436763	1/30/12	Insanely nice guy, he's really clear about what you're going to be tested on/what's important. Powerpoints are up on mycourses. It's not always the most interesting class in the world, however it's painfully obvious he loves what he's doing, and that makes him awesome/more interesting. Just do the work and put some effort into it and you'll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ricardo Figueroa	4.7	2	Imaging Science		2	5	5	3	1436763	5/18/10	Fantastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ricardo Figueroa	4.7	2	Imaging Science		5	4	4	5	1436763	8/16/10	He's a pretty good teacher and his class is pretty easy if you just do the work and study for the few quizzes and exams he gives. He does like to ramble about things that aren't going to be on the test but he always makes what is going to be on the test very clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol  Fillip	4.5	2	Design		2	5	4	5	1794619	1/25/13	Carol is a dream, very willing to work with new ideas or concepts. Can appear spacey in critiques, but is so helpful in and out of class. Answers emails even at 2 am at night! Very nice, if you talk in class and make yourself known, she grades you higher. Forge a relationship, and you will reap the benefits, of her skills and her RIT contacts
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	2	403327	2/28/12	Bill is a great guy who really cares about his students that ask for help. However, he does drag out the time of the studio class and requires you to email him projects and color comps later in the quarter instead of just bringing them into class - this can get very annoying with conflicting due dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	3	403327	12/28/10	Bill is a very honest and no-nonsense professor. If he knows you're a slacker, he'll give you a hard time. (I'm sure everyone here who posted bad feedback fits in this category.) If you simply listen to him, and do what you're supposed to do, you will learn a lot. Extra points if you ask him for help outside of class; he loves that!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	1	403327	7/24/08	I still remember the first day of INTRO. to digital illustration. He said and I quote, "This is not a class to learn new programs in." A prof. saying this now might not get the same reaction now but when I took his class, students didn't come out of HS equipped with basic vector program knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	403327	3/16/07	Bill is a great guy, maybe his teaching style has changed since these posts. I had him for dimensional 1 and 2. His main goal is to help you get better, he's had tons of experience so he has all kinds of tips. He is strict about keeping things as you sketched, and he makes sure you know that it's because that's how the real world is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	4	403327	1/19/06	Never really taught any digital techniques, he showed us a few projects he was working on. But that was it. We never did anything in the class! just crit, and going over sketches. He never would give and Constructive advice. just that ur idea had 'potential' or 'thats interesting'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	2	403327	5/22/05	he plays favorism - you have to kiss his butt to get an A, otherwise the best you'll get is a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	1	Fine Arts		4	3	3	NULL	403327	5/6/04	Boring. Reads from a book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	3	403327	11/20/11	I thought he was a great teacher and you can tell he has a passion for what he does. Class requires a significant amount of time though but it is worth it. I had 30-45hrs in each dimensional project but I received all A's so just try and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	0	Fine Arts		4	2	2	4	403327	5/20/10	This shouldn't be a full class. Bill frequently runs out of things to say, and then makes uncomfortable chitchat for hours rather than letting the class go early. The content in both is so limited you wonder how 10 weeks of class are filled. Bill comes off as a desperate salesman with frequency, so afraid of not being taken seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	0	Fine Arts	222	2	1	1	1	403327	2/21/08	Bill is absolutely horrible at composing sentences,his bumbling repitition clearly shows his lack of knowledge in the illustration world.If you try asking him a specific question all you will hear is "well uh...ya know, uh, fur, uh play with it." Isn't creative, doesnt respond to individuality, has no aesthetic sensibility. Just go to his website.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	403327	4/30/06	He is very conservative and tight. Everything needs a tight line drawing first even when its pointless. He likes to say "contrasty", which is not a word, but all that aside; you'll have some worthwhile experiences. The more time you spend on his projects the better, very time consuming.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	403327	10/8/05	Bill was an awesome instructor, his crits were helpful and strict. Kept his class proffessional and the way it should be. His teaching method was something that helped me progress to where I am now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Finewood	3.3	1	Fine Arts		3	3	3	4	403327	3/6/05	Finewood is very critical..pays attention to every single detail involved on projects, from the sketch phase to the final piece. (which could be good or bad in your opinion) He tends to expect a strict, professional level and is not very friendly or flexible in terms of critique and grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Fisher	5.0	2	Athletics		5	5	5	3	1105416	2/24/08	I took both salsa/swing and ballroom dance with Fisher and she really knows her stuff and how to shake that butt. You will definitely have a fun time in either class. She had a special activity planned for week 10 which was also a great time. Recommended professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	2	Film		1	5	5	5	959261	2/8/10	I took this professor class last fall and it was the best animation class I ever took. This professor knows really well animation and Maya. I strong recommend this professor classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	2	Film		4	5	4	4	959261	6/16/09	I took this class and love it. It changed my life. I developed a strong interest in animation and I hope to become an animator. The professor has a passion for animation and pass it to the students. She teaches in a very professional way. I had a great experience taking this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	0	Film		5	1	1	4	959261	3/24/08	Pretty useless as a teacher. You'll need to learn on your own but nice enough and fairly easy grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	2	Film		1	5	5	5	959261	6/20/09	I took a class with this professor last semester and loved it. She is really cool, knows a lot about production and animation. Her book is very good too. It is the best book about animation. I strong recommend her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	2	Film		2	5	5	4	959261	9/12/08	Tereza is a great teacher. She knows animation really well. Her teaching style is like in a professional environment. She helps us to develop problem solving and critical thinking. Lazy students sometimes don?t like her classes, but the good ones love her. I strong recommend her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tereza Flaxman	3.6	0	Film	478	4	1	1	4	959261	2/17/07	I found the Character animation class to be a step back from what I learned in 3D Animation I and I found the assignments to be extremely unmotivating. She wrote the textbook we used, so it was required, but not really usefull for the class. The grading process also seemed inconsistant and sometimes unfair. Her expectations were very unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	320	4	5	4	3	402780	2/21/13	Good teacher, attendance was required for the in class exercises. Explained code and other class content well, and made sure everyone in the class was keeping up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	219	2	4	3	2	402780	11/20/11	Had a very hard time getting in contact with Floeser over email this quarter, he just didn't respond. He seems like he has way too much on his plate and cannot juggle everything. Lectures generally were pretty boring, but if you seek one on one help it is beneficial. The guy knows what he is talking about, but his delivery just isn't good enough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	219	5	4	4	2	402780	2/3/11	He's very organized, an easy grader, but gives a lot of work. However it helps you learn the material. He's very willing to help students and to go into further detail with anything you ask. If you make jokes or make your hw humorous he will be forever grateful. Overall he's a nice guy and you should absolutely take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	219	4	5	3	2	402780	5/5/10	Hes a very nice teacher. Easy grader, easy exams, but gives hard homeworks that make you learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	3	5	4	4	402780	12/3/07	Excellent teacher. Office hours are limited, but if you need to speak w/ him all you have to do is ask. Very Helpful, always stopping to ask if everyone understands before moving on with a topic. my favorite teacher so far here at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	4	5	5	4	402780	10/17/07	Best Java teacher I've ever had. Very organized and helpful. He lays everything down so you know what you need to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	4	5	5	5	402780	11/11/06	Amazing professor! Very clear and helpful. Could always come to his office with questions and get them very well answered. Homeworks are once a week and not that though. Practicals aren't to bad either. Some of the later stuff is a bit worse. As long as you pay attention during class you'll be fine. Prof. Floeser is the best professor in IT!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	NULL	402780	5/5/04	Very helpful. Explains everything well. Great teacher. Easy grading, and very fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	402780	8/22/12	Good professor, knows his stuff, different from other traditional slideshow lecturers. He doesn't read of lectures and instead actually codes, explains, and demonstrates. Does not reply back to emails fast but he does eventually, give a few days or two. Willing to work with students independently. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	5	5	5	2	402780	11/9/11	Amazing teacher. Will take him at any opportunity. Very nice, and very clear in explanations. Knows how to prioritize grades, so projects are worth a lot and dailies aren't worth much. Also, he sounds like Robin Williams. He knows what he's talking about. By far my favorite professor so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	425	4	5	5	3	402780	5/15/10	A great professor. His lectures are focused, and he has a good sense of humor. I learned a lot about the field of HCI with his teaching. Readings were understandable, and projects were graded fairly. Overall, a very organized class. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	402780	1/20/10	Prof. Floeser makes sure that everybody knows the topic. I had prior knowledge of the subjects coming into the class, so it was a bit easier for me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	1	Computer Science		1	3	3	1	402780	11/12/07	I hated this class. It was too fast paced and I felt like I was never done...in fact, its finals week, and i have a PE to do and an HW...even though our final is tonight. Its ridiculous, he can also be extremely rude at times answering questions with sarcastic remarks. He was extremely rude to a grad during a presentation, absolutely unnecessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science	414	4	5	5	5	402780	12/6/06	Good professor overall, very helpful, knows his material. Can be a bit disorganized and forgetful at times, but that's probably due to all the work on his plate. I've heard he's difficult for the earlier programming classes, but as long as you pay attention and do your work, you'll be fine. Final project was a bit rushed, get to know your mates.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Floeser	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	NULL	402780	5/5/04	Best professor in IT so far
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	3	571338	8/3/10	Moves really fast and is kind of hard to understand, but if you can keep up you learn a lot. She is kind of cold in office hours but seems really helpful nonetheless. Tests are moderately hard and homework is long but you can tell Felea really knows her math and I learned a lot from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	571338	3/1/10	Workshops are automatic 100%. HW due every friday. both are difficult but not overwhelming. tests are moderate. expect high b's or a's. prof sometimes dives into material but it all makes sense eventually
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	571338	1/25/10	Knows her stuff, moves quickly. Somewhat hard to understand, but you get over it pretty quick. She tends to be late (not a bad thing). Explains the concepts, and not just the step-by-step. Overall, I would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	571338	11/7/08	Do not take this teacher. I had her for Multivariable calculus. She taught straight from the book and didn't add anything to her lectures. Very fast teacher. Would have been easier to skip every class and study the textbook for two hours than go to class and learn nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	571338	3/7/08	DO NOT TAKE!!! She was a horrible teacher. Her lectures were fast and her writing was hard to read. When someone would ask a question during lecture she would just repeat what she had just said and move on. If you have a question during workshop or about homework she always tells you "It's in your notes"...that's if you understand the notes. You pr
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics		1	3	2	3	571338	1/5/08	Hard to understand. Accent is harsh. Tests are unreasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	571338	2/6/06	Excellent Teacher. Notes were great. The only problem is keeping up with her. She teaches VERY fast, but the the way she gives the material makes it very easy to understand. Quizzes and Tests were not easy, but nowhere near hard. On top of that, she gives a review before tests. Grading was very lienient.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	571338	12/6/05	Great professor, very thorough. Might move a little too quickly for some people.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	4	571338	10/31/05	Pretty much takes the material from the book and puts it on the board, explains it pretty well, doesn't answer questions very well, I spent the first half of the class trying to understand her and keep up since she talks VERY fast after that it wasn't too bad though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	571338	9/19/05	What kind of comment is the one about being hot or not... lol... anyway, she's an awesome teacher. The best part of it is that she knows what she is talking about and that's very important.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	0	Mathematics	282	2	2	2	2	571338	5/2/10	She has an accent, which wouldn't be so bad if she would speak up and slow down a little bit. She teaches at about a hundred miles and hour, by the time you finish copying down the example she is done and has moved on. Tests are very difficult, and she talks down and makes you feel stupid when you ask a question.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	571338	2/4/10	She has a very fast style of teaching. This is good for review and simple concepts. But whenever she gets into more complex problems she just goes over examples, never explaining what's actually going on and helping you understand things. Her accent and two foot voice don't make things much better. In Calc III, You might as well just read the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	3	3	571338	12/15/08	Felea is awesome. Nuff said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics	283	2	3	3	5	571338	8/20/08	Professor Felea's class has hard tests, easy quizzes, and lots of homework. She goes through material quickly and sometimes gets irritated if you ask frequent/stupid questions--she is no-nonsense and is here to teach, not to waste time--but she is very smart, and will effectively help you learn the material if you work hard. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	3	571338	2/4/08	Gets frustrated when trying to explain things. Good if you are good at math, but if math isn't your strong point not recommended. Tests are hard, be sure to get all points possible on homework, workshops and quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	2	571338	3/13/06	Didn't get anything out of class, so I didn't go. Was going to teach myself the material, but didn't, but since she grades so easily ( A - 85-100, B - 70-84...) I got a C.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	5	571338	11/3/05	Fun teacher, but goes through material VERY quickly. I have a hard time keeping up when I take notes, but if you look over examples later it'll make sense. Always willing to answer questions in or out of the classroom. Quizzes were extremely easy and are multiple choice. Tests are pretty easy too, just study the review questions she goes over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	571338	10/18/05	Very well structured and organized teacher who is willing to take time out of her schedule to help you. The class is a lot of work but is well worth it and she helps you every step of the way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	3	571338	5/28/05	Very good teacher. Though at first it was a little hard to understand her, but after crossing that barrier I did not have any trouble in the class. She was always helpful and available for extra assistance after class. Her tests are easy if you study and go over all the material she gives to review.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raluca Felea	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	571338	2/18/05	Pretty good teacher. Explains concepts well. A lot of assignments, but they usually aren't that hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science	316	4	4	5	5	362125	11/8/12	Politics through film. Better or worse, has low expectations for student's political knowledge. Lectures provide useful background to films, but are not intellectually stimulating. Likes to talk way more than necessary. Great choice of films, fair quizzes and papers. A good but not outstanding professor for this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science	222	4	3	4	2	362125	5/28/09	I had him last quarter. Eh he was boring, and the class was boring. Make corny jokes that had the nerds in front of me laughing their butts off, and his essay questions were ridicoulously stupid. Also, some of his attempted humor on the tests = epic fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	362125	1/12/07	Great teacher. Sounds like Tom Bro kaw. Material is a bit dry, but he gets through it well enough. Not too boring unless you hate politics. This guy grades fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	362125	1/25/06	Great class. Very interactive. Pro. Ferber knows his stuff and is excited to teach it. No bias that I've picked up on [although.. there are 3 Army ROTC kids]. Usually one overhead slide per class, ~1 hour lecture, not a bad time. If you're looking to fill a liberal arts requirement or are interested in the subject, I recommend taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science	450	4	4	4	3	362125	12/22/11	State and Local Government class, had 3 exams and he took the average of them. Posts essay questions ahead of time, but they're usually strange questions. Fair grading and non-mandatory attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science	102	4	4	4	4	362125	4/13/09	Paul Gerber is the best teacher I've ever had. Every class we would work a bomb of peach, s a b, and play zombies. Great teacher and pulled a lot of life lessons away from his lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science		5	5	5	5	362125	10/25/06	Ferber is a great professor, as long as you take notes, review them before a quiz, and actually read the essay question he hands out to you the week before the test, and think about it, its a nice and easy A, B. Highly reccomend to anyone for american politics
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Ferber	4.5	2	Political Science		5	5	5	4	362125	11/9/05	This professore is freaking amazing. You have 3 exams in the class, he averages those out and that's your grade for the class. Also, he only thought for an hour. We only did a two hour class when he canceled one class. Take this man, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ferran	4.4	2	Theater	216	3	5	5	3	1474697	9/1/11	To this day (5 years after graduating from RIT) he is still a mentor and inspiration.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ferran	4.4	2	Theater	216	3	4	4	4	1474697	2/11/11	He knows his material very well. Very flexible, lets you to use notes for quizzes. He is very encouraging and can answers to all questions pretty well. Don't ever forget to bring your books to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ferran	4.4	2	Theater		2	4	4	4	1474697	8/21/11	One of the toughest, but most inspiring professors at RIT. He pushes you to your absolute best - which is honestly fairly rare on this campus. I highly recommend his classes - but be prepared, it is not a cakewalk.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ferran	4.4	2	Theater	101	2	5	4	2	1474697	9/5/10	awesome professor. take his classes!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	2	809221	3/6/13	Very helpful. Gives constructive criticism and likes when you ask her opinion or for help. It is easy to get an A in this class as long as Gina notices you are improving.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	809221	4/27/12	Has a lot to teach about self editing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	4	809221	4/11/11	Such a great professor, that really helps students understand how to create concepts. Her class is not hard to pass as long as you follow up with the work, which is actually fun to do
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	3	809221	3/9/11	Just amazing! Great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts	101	3	5	4	4	809221	11/12/09	Projects are vague but it forces you to think critically. She will help you along the way to explore not only ideas but a variety of mediums. if your stubborn you will hate her because your first idea will never be enough. Take this class if you actually want to learn how to create art and concepts not just execute craft projects like other teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	809221	11/16/07	She makes you think about the process of a project. She's very honest about peoples work, she'll tell you it looks like high school work if its not good enough. If you don't understand what she wants you'll think the class is hard, its alot of work but worth it. Sometimes she'll push her ideas on you but in the end her motto is "prove me wrong"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	1	Fine Arts		3	4	1	3	809221	10/23/06	shes pretty cool. she makes you work REAL hard on your projects. she wont let you get off easy. while ur in the class, you hate her and dont understand it, but once you're gone, you see how much she helped you by pushing you. she's really not THAT bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	3	809221	4/30/06	She's mean, and if she does't like your work (she usually doesn't) she doesn't hide it, at all. She's an LA girl who really never grew out of it. She says fabulous alot. And I dislike her... alot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	3	1	4	809221	2/14/06	I like her as a person, however she is extremely unclear... But one AWESOME thing about her is that you can redo your project over and over until you get a good grade. She really does want you to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	809221	1/2/13	Gina was my favorite foundations professor. She really helps you find yourself as an artist. The most helpful thing she taught me was to edit, edit, edit--how to refine my work. Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	5	809221	4/27/12	I learned a lot from her. She is 100% focused on process and really pushes you to refine your ability to self edit. She is a lot of fun too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	809221	4/11/11	Loved her, favorite foundations teacher. Projects are interesting and usually very open. She is extremely helpful too, so you will never feel lost. Miss her class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	4	809221	2/1/10	She is a nice professor, she wants you to learn. It's really not that hard for you to pass her class as long as you are willing to experiment with various ideas, mediums in her projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	809221	2/3/09	I love this class, she is the best teacher I have had so far. She made me redo a project 3 times and I still like her so you know she is good! she is honest and nice and actually cares about you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	5	809221	11/21/06	You never really know what she wants. Her opinions about your work will change in a matter of second, so don't take what she says as absolute fact. Also says peoples work has "A niiiiice sensibility" , but no one ever understands what that means.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	3	2	809221	8/7/06	gina is great if you ask for help she gives it to you shes very understanding and makes you rethink all of your reasonings for doing something instead of letting you do something because you want to. shes always there to look over any work for your classes and takes an interest in you outside of 2d it takes a personal effort to reach a higher lev
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	3	809221	3/8/06	She's hard, it's as simple as that. She's unclear on projects, then when you don't do what she wants, she's unclear about what she wants you to change. She says things like "This just doesn't work" to justify something being bad (in her eyes.) And has, more than once, asked a student durring a crit if they actually even like their work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Regina Ferrari	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	3	809221	2/8/06	She is often extremely unclear and always makes students redo projects endlessly... she is a nice person though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neeti  Fidurko	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	4	1797153	2/16/13	She's so fun and alive. Sees things through a different perspective and helps her students see the world through different eyes. Very helpful and uses examples that really help learn Flash. She also has a very unique method of teaching and it's made me love Flash!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Filip	4.7	2	Design		4	5	5	5	818074	1/29/09	Amazing Professor, one of the best at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Filip	4.7	2	Design	213	5	5	5	5	818074	1/29/07	Carol is an amazing teacher. I'd have to say she's my favorite teacher here at RIT. Carol is very nice - she almost gets down to you on a personal level, which makes the class much more laid back. She knows what she's talking about and she'll teach you so much. She'll teach you how to look deeper into design work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Filip	4.7	2	Design		3	4	4	4	818074	3/7/06	Carol is a good prof. and always willing to review and provide suggestions on work while not harshly criticizing. She's not a bad person, but for some reason I didn't care too much for her but could never pinpoint what it was. Im pretty sure it wasn't that she made me feel uncomfortable either. She grades fairly and allows re-dos. Not a bad choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Filip	4.7	2	Design	301	3	5	4	4	818074	5/13/08	Great teacher.. she loves teaching and loves helping her students do the best they can and tries to help students with things other than straight classwork as well. I learned a lot about design from her, and she's super nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Filip	4.7	2	Design		4	5	5	5	818074	4/25/06	Carol is a great choice. She can be a bit hard to pull critique out of, but if you talk to her and come to class, you should get the info you need to do well. She will never tear you apart, but she will always have a suggestion for you, so be prepared to keep working on things. Very accessible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Finch	3.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	986483	2/13/08	She's a bit motherly, but gives you clear and constructive feedback. Warning: She is more of a transliterator so if you are unsure of your ASL grammar, go to someone else.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Finton	5.0	2	Sign Language		3	5	5	5	139868	7/18/11	A great teacher! She is always available to help you and wants you to succeed. Grades fairly and gives you plenty of time to finish assignments and projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Finton	5.0	2	Sign Language		2	5	5	NULL	139868	2/19/03	One of the sweetest and most understanding teachers I have had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Finton	5.0	2	Sign Language		4	5	5	5	139868	10/31/06	She's very sweet and understanding. She is very thorough, and shes very helpful. You really learn a lot too. Prolly one of the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Fisher	5.0	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	1145096	7/21/08	I can't believe he decided to leave. One of the best I have had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		5	5	5	5	72685	10/26/05	Lowi runs the class, yes he is a good teacher, but he seems a bit preoccupied with the guy who writes our textbook
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		4	4	4	3	72685	10/20/04	cool guy, goes easy with the grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		3	5	4	NULL	72685	5/16/03	nice guy interesting classes very positive person
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		3	5	4	NULL	72685	1/6/03	lots of discussions, great class
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	4	3	72685	3/8/05	Pretty cool. Makes you subscribe to CSM, but you can get around it... Very willing to help if you fall behind or whatnot. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		3	4	4	NULL	72685	10/31/03	A bit boring
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Flemming	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	NULL	72685	2/23/03	Cool dude, I liked his class but he makes you subscribe to the CSM
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ernest  Fokoue	3.0	0	Statistics		2	2	1	4	1798935	4/6/13	Cancelled classes for personal reasons and re-scheduled on different days without more than just a few hours notice. Quiz/exam dates were unknown until the last minute. He left town during finals week and attempted to re-schedule the exam just hours before we were expected to take it. His priority is on his personal research and less on teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ernest  Fokoue	3.0	1	Statistics		1	1	4	3	1798935	2/22/13	Extremely intelligent and friendly man in life. But horrendous as a prof! Cancels 3-hour classes because of personal reasons, then schedules make-up classes at bad times. Homework was never graded or returned. No organization. Confusing lectures full of R code which is irrelevant to the tests. Final exam was on same material as the midterm. Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ernest  Fokoue	3.0	2	Statistics		5	5	5	5	1798935	3/22/13	he is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He uses R a lot, for such a graduate class, I believe R somehow is mandatory and required level of skills. He usually starts with the theoretical concepts and then R examples, which is great. The only thing that I still confused with is the Exams, they usually hard or irrelevant. Recommended:)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science		4	4	4	2	9109	3/8/11	Easy grader. Backloads his courses so you have weekly quizzes the last 3 weeks after having one every 2-3 weeks earlier on. Movies in class are interesting, tries to liven up dull lecture topics with insightful stories, quiz questions come straight from lectures/movies so there are no tricks, drops low quiz/essay anyway. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science		5	5	5	2	9109	10/11/10	Great teacher. Made the lectures interesting and was a very easy grader on essays.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science		3	4	4	3	9109	10/18/04	Awesome professor, makes the class interesting, great discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science		5	5	2	NULL	9109	5/27/01	Beware-his classes are full of computer and tech geeks.Nice professor though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science	700	4	4	3	4	9109	1/10/11	Really nice guy. Somewhat ambiguous about assignments. He cares more about your learning than the details in the syllabus. Enjoyed his class. Relax and do the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science	211	5	5	5	5	9109	10/17/06	Awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Foltz	4.2	2	Science		5	5	4	NULL	9109	7/24/01	kickass professor, great classes, very interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diane Forbes	4.2	2	Languages		3	4	4	5	1437409	12/22/11	Really knows her stuff, but demands a lot from the students. Homework every class as well as weekly online recordings with an in-class partner. Quizzes and tests aren't terribly difficult if you prepare for them. Does not respond well to joking around in dialogues, she prefers boring and professional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diane Forbes	4.2	2	Languages	101	3	4	5	3	1437409	5/3/10	Had for Beg. Spanish I. Keeps things pretty fun and easy. If you have no interest in the subject she has a little less patience. Remember to do your online Quia work, it's easy to forget but extremely easy to complete. Quizzes are a little tougher than tests. The midterm and final sound a lot harder than they really are
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	1	Political Science		1	3	3	4	72686	3/11/13	Lots of work. Huge amounts of reading. Do all the readings and study hard... Maybe you will get a B. He isnt that helpful and never explains what he wants you to know from the readings and usually doesnt test on most of the readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		2	5	5	4	72686	9/24/12	First class I ever took in political science was with him. I have since taken three more classes with Dr F. as the instructor. Great knowledge, insight, depth and able to relate past to present within the political arena. Assignments are not easy, but in the end, you feel as though you really learned something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	460	1	5	4	3	72686	3/4/10	Constitutional Rights and Liberties had to be one of the hardest classes i've taken in the Liberal Arts Department, but one of the most beneficial. Tests/(Pop) Quizzes are challenging, attendance is required, but Dr. F knows his stuff! I went to his office several times for extra help and he more than helpful! Put in the work and you'll love it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		2	5	5	2	72686	11/6/09	Just an incredible instructor. I took his class just for the credit but became interested in the material from Day 1. His discussions help you understand real world issues and he always manages to keep you interested throughout the class. Don't take this class thinking that it will be an easy A. You will work hard for a B,but its a great experience
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		1	5	5	5	72686	4/15/09	I took Political Theory with him. Incredible teacher. His lectures were riveting. Explained political philosophy with the ease of a master. Having said that, I must say I've never worked so hard for an A in my life. Very challenging- because he cares so much. Be prepared to write essays. Very rewarding teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	101	3	5	5	2	72686	1/22/09	Simply the most concerned wonderful teacher in I have ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	513	2	5	4	4	72686	10/22/08	Dr. Fornieri is one of my favorite professors at RIT. I highly recommend taking one of his classes. You can really tell that he loves his job. Lectures were always interesting, and he really wants to see you succeed. He definitely made you think but his classes weren't overly difficult. Do your reading if taking one of his upper level classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		2	4	4	4	72686	4/14/08	Fornieri is a nice professor and likes to get to know his students. talks a lot, his upper level courses are harder than american politics. Need to study for his tests, need to participate in class, need to read the books. Get a better grade if make effort to participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	4	4	72686	11/9/05	Very intelligent. Lectures are rather intriguing even though sometimes he goes beyond the scope of the class. Tests are all multiple choice and he uses the same questions again on most of them. Quizzes are partially current events; I watched the Daily Show and did great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	4	3	72686	6/23/05	Awesome professor, so awesome I get to take the class again. My fault for not going to class, however the few interactions I did have with him were awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	458	1	5	5	5	72686	10/23/12	Dr. Fornieri is one of the most passionate professors about politics at RIT. He truly appreciates the combination of allowing his students to learn, voice their opinions, and enjoy the material. Quizzes, Exams, and Writings are always fair in that as long as you take meticulous notes and analyze the texts of the course, you should do quite well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	211	3	5	5	4	72686	2/10/11	Awesome Professor! He makes any dry topic more interesting and always throws in some jokes. There is quite a bit of reading to do in the class but very manageable. You will have to put in effort for an A but in the end it's worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	1	Political Science	211	3	3	2	4	72686	2/10/10	Dr Fornieri is a smart guy; he knows his stuff. He even wrote a book (he will let you know it, too). That being said, he is fun to have in class, but only because he goes off on comical tangents every 30 seconds. He is not organized, and you are forced to teach yourself out of the book and then sit through his pointless lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	72686	10/26/09	this guy is the****, pretty much. actually makes you want to learn, has a bunch of antics that keep you awake. i had history of american politics with him, maybe my favorite class so far. so, yeah, you won't regret him as a professor, and if you do then there might be something wrong with you...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	1	Political Science		1	2	3	2	72686	2/14/09	Teaches too much information. Expect to be tested on material from 2 texts and his own lectures. Rambles forever, and expects you to remember details on about 50+ court cases. Tests are pretty hard, but not impossible to pass on. He's sympathetic though, and is extremely well-versed in Politics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		5	5	5	3	72686	11/12/08	Dr Fornieri is an excellent professor, and has a passion for politics which helps you better understand the material. Lectures are always interesting, and draw more from current events rather than readings. He is the essence of a good professor because he can get you to understand fully the real world implications of our political system.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	211	4	5	5	5	72686	4/14/08	This guy LOVES what he does and it definitely shows. His lectures are always interesting. The American Politics tests are multiple choice and a few short essays. Decent amount of readings from the book but they are fascinating and lead to interesting class discussion. Hilarious Nixon impression.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science	513	2	5	5	3	72686	12/8/06	I supposed to be failed in that class so bad but teacher gave me D and let me retake this course for a better grade! Many Thanks to that teacher :)

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	NULL	72686	5/5/04	Awesome teacher...Definitely knows his stuff and does a good job of conveying it to students. Tests and quizzes are almost rediculously easy, and all multiple choice. Didn't go to half the classes and still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		2	5	5	NULL	72686	11/9/03	EXTREMELY intellegent. . knows his stuff! Sometimes he goes above student's heads, but you would be hard pressed to find a more knowledgable teacher or a better person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		2	3	4	NULL	72686	6/24/03	Very biased. Knows alot, and expects you to "spoon feed" his lectures back to him on his essay tests. Overall, very nice guy, just very demanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		4	5	5	NULL	72686	2/23/03	Fornieri is an excellent prof, though a little bias towards the right
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		3	5	5	NULL	72686	2/19/03	Aesthetically pleasing!! Nicest teacher I have ever met!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		3	5	5	NULL	72686	2/20/03	Thumbs up
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Fornieri	4.5	2	Political Science		3	3	5	NULL	72686	2/18/03	Prof. Fornieri is a good teacher but is highly biased towards the left wing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shaun Foster	4.5	2	Graphic Arts	101	4	5	4	5	1093883	10/6/08	Awesome professor. Delivers material well, and really wants you to learn. I switched from IT to CIAS, and he is better than ANY of the IT professors IMHO. I will definitely be taking classes with him in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shaun Foster	4.5	2	Graphic Arts	732	5	5	4	4	1093883	1/16/08	Shaun's a very good professor. He's very down to Earth and very supportive. He will stop the class to answer any questions you might have and will probably have a good answer for each one. My only concern is at times, his class may be a little boring at times, but it's fun for the most part.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shaun Foster	4.5	2	Graphic Arts	731	4	5	4	4	1093883	9/3/08	Shaun is a great professor, he is always there to help and you could definitely learn a lot form him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Frank	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	4	922128	2/11/08	He's a great teacher and really willing to help out his students. But the open ended assignments can leave you a bit up in the air when you are just learning about stuff like lighting. Well versed in all photo mediums for the most part but does tend to favor a fine art style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Frank	3.7	1	Fine Arts	252	4	4	2	4	922128	11/27/06	Knows photography. Assignments are very open, which allows for creativity or confusion. Assignment details often change frequently and at the last minute.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Frank	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	922128	12/1/07	VERY fine art, which at the time wasn't for me, but I appreciate it more now and go back to him often for advice. Knows his stuff, digital and otherwise. Very helpful and approachable. Class was always fun and I'm sad he doesn't teach the upper level courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Fraser	3.8	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	2	1054311	7/9/08	He seems quiet and nice when you first meet him. Spends class teaching what he's supposed to teach and makes sure everyone understands. Quizzes, tests, and homework were all understandable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Fraser	3.8	2	Mathematics	205	3	4	4	2	1054311	11/13/07	Fraser is a nice guy, but can be hard to understand. He moves really quickly through the material, and his office hours are limited if you need more help. The homework and quizzes are weekly (which doesn't give you much time to learn the material outside of class) and he doesn't really do any review in-class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Fraser	3.8	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	4	3	1054311	3/30/08	Fraser is a fun guy, you just gotta push him a little and he responds and keeps going. Did a good job covering the topics, and if you can catch him for office hours he is really helpful. I would not have passed without the office hour help the hour before class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorrie Frear	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	4	468877	11/21/12	Having to take the same professor for more than one class in a quarter could be scary...but I took two classes with Lorrie this quarter (Calligraphy + Editorial Design) and was so thankful for the humor, experience, and attention to detail she brings. She has a friendly vibe and made me feel comfortable during critique or asking questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorrie Frear	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	5	5	468877	2/29/12	Lorrie is an amazing professor. She knows so much about Typography, and she loves talking about it. She knows when to push a student and when to let the student go on his own. She doesn't hand out A's. Instead she will help you get the skills you need as a designer. lorrie is hilarious and creative. If you want to learn about type, take Lorrie.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorrie Frear	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	4	468877	10/6/04	Definitely knows her stuff, very nice and willing to help out, though she doesn't like to linger on something for too long. Moderate amount of work, a very worthwhile class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	359029	5/27/12	For Biocompatibility and the Immune system, he was awesome. Very knowledgeable and easy to pay attention to, will gladly elaborate on confusing parts, has a study session where he tells you exactly what you need to know for the test, and will remove a question from the test if most of the class got it wrong-explaining it and giving everyone points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		5	5	5	5	359029	1/25/11	the best teacher ever in RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	4	2	359029	1/22/10	Best teacher ever for an upper level bio class! He's so passionate about immunology that he makes you want to learn. Lets you use double sided PRINTED cheat sheet on exams. Def take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	5	5	359029	2/8/09	I LOVED THIS CLASS! I love immunology but he made everything SO CLEAR and he was EXTREMELY organized! Unbelievable! He gave tons of bonus points. Buy the CLICKER! I have more than 20 raw bonus points because of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	359029	2/1/06	Very interested in what his students want. Many oppurtunities to do well in the class. If a test is even the slightest bit ambiguous, he'll give the whole class the points for it. If you argue a question, he'll most likely give you credit for you. Very interesting, kept me awake at 8 am.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	5	3	359029	12/9/05	Simply the best professor in this field. Take him and you'll see why. He's usually eccentric, but that makes it all much more interesting. Exams are perfectly reasonable and he's willing to reason when it comes to grades. TAKE HIM!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		5	4	5	5	359029	2/7/12	Very understanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology	312	4	5	5	4	359029	1/26/10	He is AWESOME. Sometimes I am listening to him during the lecture and I just want to come up to him and tell him that. He knows how to motivate his students by rewarding them and giving them an opportunity to improve. Clear,organized, passionate, great communication skills, experienced. Simply the best of the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology	312	5	5	5	5	359029	5/25/09	Seriously the Best teacher at RIT, extremely helpful and wants all his students to succeed if you ever have a chance take a class with him, you will not regret it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology	312	3	5	5	4	359029	8/22/07	BEST teacher I've had in the Bio department yet! Portrays information in a very clear and easy to understand way. Go to lecture and take good notes. Grading is very fair and he loves to give away extra pts/pts for ambiguous questions on tests so question everything!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	0	Biology		5	1	3	5	359029	12/15/05	The man loves to hear himself talk TOO much. Mostly redundant drivel - and also one of the most unhelpful and pompous college instructor I ever had the misfortune of coming across.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	1	Biology		2	3	3	1	359029	9/7/05	I really did not enjoy his classes at all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Frederick	4.6	2	Biology		5	5	5	NULL	359029	2/27/04	This professor is simply put, the BEST professor I've had in RIT in the past two years I've been here. His lectures are crystal clear, he provides his students plentiful opportunities to ace the course! Take his class and you won't regret it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	5	136826	2/2/06	I thought that he was a bad teacher...didn't like his test or his attitude towards the theatre...Major of class felt the same way!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	136826	6/20/05	no study guide ... boring quizzes ...presentation is too long...dont take this 5 weeks course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	136826	5/8/04	His course takes a bit of work(lots of reading). he is a great teacher though, makes theatre somewhat interesting(which isn't easy), definately recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	136826	2/19/03	Awsome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	136826	7/13/05	He appreciates everyone who isn't clearly an idiot, which you'd have to be to do poorly in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Freeman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	3	136826	11/20/04	never thought theatre could be so cool! and i'm a republican! if i were strapped to this guy's back for like a year, i'd never get bored! interestingest guy ever

Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	1362541	11/16/12	Fluet is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. What's more, his evident enjoyment of teaching the material makes him a pleasure to learn from. The programming assignments are very helpful and modular, and he's nice enough to provide pre-authored test cases for each required function, which turns otherwise time-consuming debugging into a breeze.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	1	Computer Science		1	3	2	4	1362541	3/1/12	IF you are new to programming , you will be left when you are taking CS2 with him.Recommend to get a private tutor for CS242 if you are new to programming . He is very helpful and approach him for lab questions in office hour
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	1362541	1/23/11	Professor Fluet is a relatively new teacher who is still improving his teaching method and material. He is receptive to criticism, especially when he can use it to improve the course and is willing to provide clues via e-mail. His late system lets you have some slack if you get stuck and he is an overall great professor to have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science	450	2	5	4	3	1362541	11/6/10	Professor Fluet is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. Extremely intelligent, extremely helpful, and an all-around interesting person to talk to. There is no one better for PLC -- Professor Fluet eats, sleeps, and breathes programming languages. There is a decent amount of work, but you *will* learn a ton. Highly, highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science	450	3	5	5	2	1362541	11/22/09	A little dry during lecture, but puts in a tremendous amount of effort. I've never had a professor be so responsive to email and out-of-lecture questions. Very fair, very knowledgeable, and curved exam grades whenever the class did poorly as a whole. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	5	3	3	1362541	5/17/12	He's a pretty good teacher. He knows a LOT of information and expects that you know it as well. Some of the info went right over my head, but he is an awesome teacher. Office hours are very helpful, loves partial credit. You will learn a lot in this class if you pay attention and stay on top of your homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	3	4	2	1362541	10/23/11	Fluet is a pretty decent professor but I feel as if he doesn't explain thoroughly or he leaves things out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science	333	4	5	5	5	1362541	1/12/11	A very animated professor that is full of energy. He knows the things he teaches well. Tests are moderate, but sometimes the questions can be tricky. One more thing: I've had him for two classes and in both I never touched the books required for the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Fluet	4.2	2	Computer Science	450	2	5	4	4	1362541	12/1/09	Lecture can be boring. However the notes are posted online, which is a good thing because there are TONS of them. Tests are open-notes, so they are very long and very hard; however he is a fair grader. Projects are very difficult or time consuming, START EARLY! Very helpful, very approachable: a very rewarding experience. Would take again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Foley	2.6	2	Writing	227	3	4	3	1	1628714	11/7/12	She seemed genuinely interested in making us better writers. I don't understand why the other commenters struggled so much, I had harder writing assignments in high school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Foley	2.6	0	Writing		1	1	2	1	1628714	1/23/12	Stay away from this professor. I'm an engineering major and I was spending more time on this class than math & science combined. She expects way too much and the papers we had to write were irrelevant, confusing and pointless. I feel like I wasted all of my nights staying up till 4am writing because I have to retake the class now anyway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Foley	2.6	1	Writing		3	2	4	2	1628714	10/19/11	She really knows her stuff and loves english/writing, but she is not set out for teaching. Her lectures are boring and confusing, and she is a tough grader. She definitely favors some students and isn't nice to others. All of the topics that we had to write about for our essays were dumb. I was so bored the whole time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Foley	2.6	1	Writing		2	4	2	1	1628714	2/27/12	If you're not already good at writing essays, don't take this class. Her essay prompts are confusing and boring and rely on equally confusing and boring essays that she assigns to read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Foley	2.6	0	Writing		2	1	3	1	1628714	12/14/11	Completely ridiculous. Don't take her because there are about 20 other professors most of which will make the class an easy A. I took her freshman year and after 4 quarters that class is still my only B. Expects way too much dedication from a class that is required and no one takes by choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diane Forbes	5.0	2	Spanish		5	5	5	5	1752457	12/11/12	awesome professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Allen Ford	2.2	1	Accounting	222	4	2	3	2	869202	5/13/08	He is a good teacher but did not communicate with us very well. He only gave us homework but he went over as gave us answers. Also, the take-home tests helped us a lot to learn and work challenging questions, however he taught us only one chapter in 4 weeks. Just a basis teaching with his teacher booklet and we learned almost nothing from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Allen Ford	2.2	0	Accounting		2	3	1	4	869202	7/26/06	This course was online - he was great for the first 3 weeks, even working with vacation schedules; then all of a sudden he disappeared until around week 8 when a few students started getting replies to some of the many e-mails sent trying to contact him. Also, no tests or project work was graded during that time, which was really frustrating.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecil Foster	2.5	1	Sociology		5	3	3	1	1487671	10/17/11	Blended course. Half class Half online. He's nice. Sometimes boring. But easy.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Frankiln	4.7	2	Physics	318	3	5	5	3	1345301	1/26/11	This is the hottest teacher I have ever had. All class long I just sit there fantasizing about him. That long curly hair really lights my fire. Scott, if you read this find me!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Frankiln	4.7	2	Physics	311	4	5	3	5	1345301	2/27/10	He's a nice and very funny guy. He does take the time, especially out of class to help those who need it. He does what's called "invent and tell" which means, here you have no clue what this is but do it and I'll tell you how you're stupid afterwards which is a clever idea, unless you already aced this course in highschool!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Frankiln	4.7	2	Physics	311	2	5	5	4	1345301	11/2/09	He teaches using "invent and tell" which is tough, but you learn a lot and, if you actually try, you do very well on exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Frankiln	4.7	2	Physics	318	2	5	5	5	1345301	5/22/10	Had for Vibrations and Waves. Did a really good job at explaining things. Lectures definitely are extremely important. Tons of homework makes the class hard. Worksheets warp your mind, but reinforce the material very well. Tests are very good at separating those who know the material at each grade level. Wears funny "naked" running shoes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Frankiln	4.7	2	Physics		3	5	4	4	1345301	1/26/10	Great teacher, very helpful when asked questions. Tests and grading were fair. He will make sure you understand the material if your having trouble so long as you ask. Good sense of humor and awesome rubber toe shoes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	0	Business	101	3	1	1	2	1422037	1/17/13	avoid at costs. His lectures are direct from slideshows he provides, but attendance is mandatory. His monotone voice will bore you to death and he has an uncanny ability to know precisely when you're not paying attention for a gotcha moment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	0	Business	112	2	1	1	1	1422037	5/11/11	John Frater is one of the most inconsiderate professors I have ever meet. He does not explain properly the material. He is very dry in his teaching methods and lacks the ability to engage students. Furthermore, He also is not helpful to students when they ask questions but rather talks down to them and is not approachable at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	0	Business		5	1	3	2	1422037	11/29/10	i had him for a first year enrichment teacher. One day he told our whole class that our opinions were plain out wrong. He almost made one girl cry be telling her that he was going to cut her off because she was wrong. He judges before getting to know you. He knows very little about the school. He tried to get us to tell him what we put on his eval.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	0	Business	101	2	1	2	3	1422037	1/17/13	I would rather drop out of school or sit through Chinese water torture than sit through this man's class. He is a terrible teacher and only teaches what the teachers edition of the book provides him with. If you have the opportunity to take one of his classes, RUN!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	0	Business		1	2	2	1	1422037	4/5/11	horrible teacher. extremely condescening and rude. does not let students explain ideas just shuts them down. does not know how to teach a class well. DO NOT TAKE HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Frater	1.8	1	Business		2	3	3	3	1422037	4/15/10	Class was somewhat boring because it was more for transfer students. He knew what he was talking about, but didn't know how to relay it very well.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Freckleton	4.1	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	108582	5/30/07	This guy knows his stuff. If want a teacher that has had years of experience doing this stuff, he's the man. Ask him a question and he'll do the best he can to help you out. Make sure you do your work and you should end up with at least a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Freckleton	4.1	2	Engineering		2	5	5	NULL	108582	3/31/04	Smartest professor on campus, knows what he's doing, very helpful.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Freeman	2.4	2	Anthropology	101	5	4	4	2	121845	10/24/07	Great professor. I learned a lot about anthro in a good way, by reading ethnographies, talking, and doing EASY and related projects. Seriously, the class is easy. Freeman is liberal, I am conservative and he just engages in fair disscussion. No animosity whatsoever! Yay Freeman!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Freeman	2.4	2	Anthropology		1	3	4	3	121845	10/18/07	As said, gives a LOT of work. Often 100+ pages per week plus 3 papers of at least 4 pages in length. On the other hand, he has many interesting stories to share and certainly knows what he's talking about in terms of Anthropology. Good enthusiasm and (mostly) fair grading. Second half of quarter consisted of many movies in class which was a plus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Freeman	2.4	0	Anthropology		3	1	1	NULL	121845	8/5/03	Projects his Communist/Socialist Beliefs on the class. Very narrow minded on his beliefs. If it aint liberal he doesnt wanna hear it. Plays favorites. Can be very rude to students, singling out in front of class. Talks too much bout drug habbits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Freeman	2.4	1	Anthropology		1	3	3	NULL	121845	2/19/03	50-100 pages of reading a week. Hard grading system, unrealistic expectations
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	513065	10/25/12	Great professor, interesting lectures, reasonably intelligent in helping solve coding problems, always willing to help students, responsive to emails, willing to work with you, cares about students. Would definitely try to take him for another class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	513065	7/13/11	great guy, great teacher. Tough subject, but makes it manageable, most professors couldn't. will help all you need, stop, slowdown, etc. lenient on times due (due midnight,most of mine avg. 3am-noon the following day)never lost points. will run around room person to person to help keep up during lab. ask for help and you will receive gladly, A++++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	3	513065	11/30/09	Great Guy. Really helped me out when I needed it. More of a people person than a number person in grading style. If you can get his class take it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	513065	11/4/09	Great professor, I had him for Programming 1 and I came into the class with no understanding of java. He makes everything very clear and answers any questions you might have about the topic! I wish i could take Programming 2 with him. If you go to class and do the In class assignments plus the homework you will learn a lot from this prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	360	5	5	4	3	513065	4/28/08	Bryan is a great guy overall. He's willing to go over something multiple times if you don't understand it. He's a fair grader with a very easy-going personality. I would definitely take one of his classes again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	219	4	5	5	4	513065	11/29/06	He's an awesome professor. I would recommend you to take Professor Whittington or Professor French as your primary choice for any programming class. He explains it in utmost clarity, although he expect you to use javadocs instead of showing code as examples, but that rarely happens. I strong recommend anyone to take this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	3	513065	5/3/06	Easy, but you have to study. Hands out lecture prep which you need to review the topic of next days lecture. Helps, but there are usually a lot of students wanting help. If you know programming, you can spend the class time playing games, doesn't mind. The faster you finish your in-class exercise, the faster you can leave.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	513065	12/2/04	French is a great guy, very helpful outside of class, guiding you in the right direction after the class is over, etc. Found I learned the most from doing the homework and learning myself, or seeing him outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	542	4	5	5	4	513065	5/20/12	Lots of work, sometimes it feels like busy work, but you do learn what you need to and he's always very helpful and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	539	3	5	5	5	513065	5/4/10	Had him for my 2nd java class as well as PHP - if you show up and do your work he will help you. Basically, if you're not a complete jerk you will be very successful in one of his classes. Also, he can be fairly lenient with a project being a day or two late if you do show up all the time and participate etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	3	5	4	3	513065	11/5/09	Great teacher...some of the stuff was a little hard to grasp but he works with you and make sure that u can understand it. i Recommend this professor if you are taking programming for info tech 1!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	0	Computer Science	101	3	2	2	4	513065	4/2/09	He talks too fast on lectures and covers too much detail in them and forgets to explain the fundamentals for those who don't know or are rusty with certain programming languages. However, he is helpful if you ask questions and has a good attitude.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	1	Computer Science	219	2	1	5	4	513065	4/19/07	Great teacher for java and database
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	221	5	4	4	3	513065	11/16/06	He is a nice guy, teaches class kinda quick but through, grades easy, gives you more than enough time to finish ICE's in class. Lets you use a cheat sheet for the pratical. Highly Reccommend to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	218	4	5	5	5	513065	10/18/05	Extremely helpful and clear. He is more than willing to help you understand anything you need. Recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science	217	4	5	5	5	513065	3/1/05	Excellent instructor. Always answers questions. I remember another student asked a question that French did not know the answer to, so he researched it in his spare time to assist the student and answered it the next day. This class is relatively easy as long as you do the homeworks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bryan French	4.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	513065	11/28/04	Certainly didn't have any trouble getting an A in this class, i felt the teacher was clear and detailed, and he was very helpful if you requested extra assistance, and was always available through First Class and email for extra help. He did speak in a bit of a monotone, but it was tolerable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	1	Engineering		3	2	3	2	357434	2/15/13	Not easy to get A no matter how hard you work.. You need to be very lucky to be get an A in his courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	1	Engineering		2	2	4	2	357434	10/24/11	A good professor who knows what he is teaching. Tough to get an A but all in all, a worth it experience. Not very helpful and can be arrogant at times, but what he teaches in class is very valuable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	0	Engineering	480	2	2	2	4	357434	4/1/08	Took an online class, and it was a waste of time. He picked very boring telecommunication topics to cover, gave out a lot of 'busy' work (150 definitions!?), piled on quiz after quiz (weekly), and gave an exam that you had to show up at RIT for - it's an ONLINE course! Why are we meeting on campus?? Never again will I take something with this man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	2	Engineering		1	5	5	5	357434	12/6/04	He let's you know exactly what he expects from you and what you need to do to get a good grade. While I got an A in his class I had to work for it but it felt good. There is always more to learn long after the class is finished.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	2	Engineering		2	3	4	4	357434	2/12/12	He is rude, be careful with him. But he is helpful and his classes are interesting. But never try to cheat in his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	1	Engineering	780	3	2	3	4	357434	6/9/10	This course is elective class. If you are technical, you will learn facts and figures. Read his bio. If are interested in telecommunication history register for this course. He knows the technology from manager perspective.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Fulle	3.1	1	Engineering	477	1	2	3	3	357434	1/14/08	This guy is not a very teacher. He teaches through powerpoint and he's very arrogant. Doesn't give much partial credit at all. Stay away from him if it's at all possible.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Fullerton	5.0	2	Engineering	703	4	5	5	5	1164083	3/21/09	Provides class notes, teaches practical side of topic, hates the Yankees. Don't fall asleep in class!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Fullerton	5.0	2	Engineering	643	5	5	5	3	1164083	12/8/08	Easy professor. Teaches an upper level process engineering class. No math only concepts! Tests are short answer questions. Notes are online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	1331725	10/26/12	Very good professor. ICV is not hard at ll but requires a lot of work. Overall it is very good course and very good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	1331725	10/18/10	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	3	1331725	12/4/09	Professor was very clear in explaining the concepts and material provided on the website was excellent
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science	757	3	4	4	5	1331725	12/4/09	excellent instructor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	4	1331725	12/3/09	Lectures are very boring: two hours of black-on-white PowerPoint with diagrams straight from the textbook. Homework assignments are easy, but tests are difficult because it's hard to tell what's going to be on them. Completely inflexible with deadlines, even if you are sick and tell him ahead of time. Intelligent, though, and easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	1	Computer Science	457	2	1	4	4	1331725	11/22/11	He left most of the lectures up to his assistant, and all of the grading to her as well. When I went to get help, I got an attitude that I was doing the work wrong, but not much direction to where to go to next. His assistant was quite knowledgeable and helpful. Paycheck should go to her, and not him. If you want to pass the tests, go to lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	5	1331725	4/20/10	It's extremely evident that Professor Gaborski is an expert in the field, however it's important to note that his homework assignments are not *hard* but he doesn't adequately prepare you for them really. Tight deadlines too. Fair warning: Be prepared to teach yourself the material, but it's very rewarding once it all 'clicks'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science	757	3	5	5	4	1331725	12/4/09	Give a good introduction so as to what the field of computer vision is all about.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Gaborski	3.7	2	Computer Science	485	1	2	5	4	1331725	11/15/09	Gaborski makes it seem like this class is easy, but watch out! The midterm will have a 16/75 point question on a problem that was only covered on 1 slide out of a 100+ slide powerpoint (and he has a powerpoint every class). That should tell you something...The class is interesting but the exams are terrible. Avoid if you want to keep a good GPA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julia Galloway	1.9	0	Fine Arts	501	1	1	1	4	256287	10/23/10	Highly unstable, ego driven and treats students like her servants. I don't understand why she teaches, she's not an educator. Overly concerned with her legacy. Thankfully she moved to the University of Montana.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julia Galloway	1.9	2	Fine Arts		1	4	5	5	256287	9/2/05	took the class outside of my major. very difficult, but she is an amazing potter. if you really want to learn and push yourself, take a class from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julia Galloway	1.9	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	NULL	256287	5/9/04	I agree with the rest of the comments at this time.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dean Ganskop	4.5	2	Information Technology	539	4	5	4	4	1749388	11/14/12	Great teacher, always fair, will help you whenever needed. Had to text him a few times and responds quickly. Does teach by example that helps greatly with programming. I would strongly suggest him. Very down to earth guy who is easy to talk to. Great Prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Garcia	4.4	2	Political Science	214	4	5	5	4	1480871	10/16/11	He was a really great teacher. He's really willing to help any student out if they don't understand. His tests are all off the slides and the essay we were required to write was really easy. Overall, a good teacher. Not my favorite topic but he tried to make it as interesting as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Garcia	4.4	2	Political Science		4	5	4	2	1480871	4/27/11	The teacher is very kind. The material is not hard if pay attention. His slides are on the internet and his tests are off his slides. Easy class and he likes to help you if you don't understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Garcia	4.4	2	Political Science	513	1	4	4	3	1480871	5/9/11	Very helpful and is always willing to meet with you and go over material you don't understand. Very nice eye candy ;)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Garcia	4.4	2	Political Science		2	5	3	3	1480871	10/5/10	He seems happy to teach and he really promotes discussion. Its his first year and the material is very hard so id say he does a really good job at attempting to teach this class. Very nice guy but also he gets a little above our heads when he goes to explain some things but if you talk to him one on one he really helps.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Garrick	4.7	2	Engineering		2	5	5	1	1323813	3/5/12	Skipped 7 of the 10 lectures, showed up to the minimal 5 lab sections, got the class average in lab reports (which wasn't good, mind you) but he offered to curve the grade to bail us all out. Great professor, works with you throughout the labs/ project, answers emails, available in his office, very insightful and knowledgeable. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Garrick	4.7	2	Engineering		4	4	4	4	1323813	10/28/09	Great lab teacher easy going and uses mycourses to its full potential. He lets you have fun in lab and create your own pneumatic systems if you finish early which is normal for all the students. Be carefull though he usually asks for less then he expects on the reports.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Garrick	4.7	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1323813	10/26/11	AWESOME PROFESSOR! Easy going and fun, also an easy grader and works with you if you miss work. Take all of his classes if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Garrison	2.4	2	Information Technology	875	4	5	5	5	429577	10/29/07	One of the best in the department. Has a different teaching style that is so good and engaging. Very laid back approach and clear explanations makes learning easy. Very interested in making us successful. Expects high level of student work which upsets some students looking for an easy 'A'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Garrison	2.4	0	Information Technology		5	2	2	1	429577	5/23/06	Did not feel like he was interested in the class. Late getting assignments back. Unclear on assignment grading areas.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Garrison	2.4	0	Information Technology	872	2	2	2	4	429577	11/15/06	He was working at another college while teaching distance learning for RIT. DL classes are RIT are basically "you learna dn do the work on your own, and we'll give you a grade". Not sure what I paid RIT for other than a line on a transcript. I was the teacher and the student. He has a TA do the grading of assignments.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Changfeng GE	3.0	1	Packaging Science	301	4	3	3	2	1688586	10/29/12	Very thick Chinese accent. Pay attention when using solid works. Bring text book because instructions are in there. Easy grader but computers stop working sometimes and he gets very frustrated. Also he is a pushover but don't bug him. Easy A if you get your work done. If you dont show up to class you are basically out of luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Damita Freeman-Peace	4.0	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	1050387	11/7/07	She is very friendly and generally easy going. You read a bunch of plays and have quizzes on them each week. The class is not hard, but is one of the most drawn out classes I have ever had. She runs out of things to do after hour 1 and stretches almost nothing to a full 4 hours. Easy class, but so incredibly boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Frost	2.8	0	Science Technology & Society	211	2	2	1	2	1638661	11/22/11	Not a good teacher. Consistently goes off topic and class lectures have little to do with the meaning of the reading. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Frost	2.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	4	4	4	1638661	11/20/11	Not too hard. Asks specific but challenging questions on quizzes. Once you realize what he wants on tests/quizzes youll breeze through.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Frost	2.8	2	Science Technology & Society	211	3	5	4	5	1638661	11/21/11	The class started out pretty tough because nobody expected what would be on the quizzes. Here are some tips: Know the dates and authors of every article you read, and know how the title of the author relates to his/her opinion. I spent too much time studying random details and when I just studied those 3 things, I got 100 on the last 5 quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Frost	2.8	0	Science Technology & Society		2	1	1	2	1638661	11/7/11	Terrible Teacher, doesn't have consistent grading. Extremely boring, gives what he calls "easy' quizzes full of trick questions. If you read all the assignments and expect to be questioned on the major topics you will probably get a low quiz grade. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Fuller	4.2	2	Engineering		5	4	5	4	687147	2/26/13	This guy was awesome, he teaches from powerpoints but don't fret he does it well. There is no text, he gives you required material. Exams are very clear cut and you'll know exactly whats on them. He makes it known what you're expected to know how to do and I liked that. Go to his office hours he's a pretty cool guy outside of class too.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History	101	3	5	5	1	1489196	10/13/12	Fundraising and grant writing class -> Peter's lectures were concise, effective and extremely beneficial. I cant imagine staying awake in the class with out really good professor. If you care about learning about art history or grant writing take Gabak, even if you hate the topic you will enjoy it after his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		5	5	4	4	1489196	12/6/11	teacher is awesome and energetic. easy to talk to. I never used the book. the title was fundraising and grant writting but 90% of the course was marketing (making brochures ect.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		4	5	5	2	1489196	11/15/11	Such a great teacher. Really cares about students learning and can make even boring classes and topics extremely interesting. Take as many classes as you can from this incredible professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		2	5	5	4	1489196	3/20/11	Peter is amazing! By far the most passionate, interesting, and helpful teacher I've ever had. He knows so much about art history and you can tell that he absolutely loves teaching it. He does not give multiple choice tests, but rather gives take home essay tests. This is a great way to learn the material. I highly recommend him as a professor!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		3	5	5	4	1489196	1/30/11	Prof. Gabak's Survey of Western Art class is great! He knows art history inside and out and loves it. He speaks quickly so make sure to listen intently. Whether you do well is entirely up to you. Some people slack off in his class but those who don't will do well. He is a fair grader and gives you multiple chances to raise your grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History	102	2	5	5	5	1489196	1/23/12	Peter is INCREDIBLE! He is so easy to talk to and just a generally funny and friendly guy. He's also brilliant- he knows a ton about art + architectural history and he makes everyone excited about learning it. Take as many classes with him as you can!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		3	5	5	4	1489196	12/4/11	Peter is awesome. Cares about you inside AND outside of the classroom. He grades a little harshly (got a 94 in his class and still got a B), and he didn't mention that in the syllabus. BUT Peter is amazing and I highly recommend him to anyone and everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History		2	5	5	4	1489196	9/1/11	I accidentally butt dialed my mom while in Gabak's Western Art lecture one night. I looked at my phone at the end and realized she had been there listening to his lecture for the past 40 minutes. My mom knows nothing about art history and she said she couldn't stop listening, it was that good. Gabak's lectures are amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Gabak	4.9	2	Art History	101	3	5	5	5	1489196	3/12/11	Everyone should take Peter,not only does he offer extensive knowledge in art history he is the goto source for all of your grant writing and fundraising needs. Great to have a professor as inspiring as peter

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	4	727855	10/7/07	Great prof, easy to reach. Was an RIT student herself. I recommended Galle for the full calc track.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	727855	5/1/07	She is the best teacher ever. I miss her. I wish she taught every math class I have to take. Her class is fun. She always has lots of energy in class. Keeps you awake
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics	274	4	5	5	4	727855	9/20/06	Very good teacher, quite possibly the best math teacher at RIT. Quizes are easy and credit is given with work and process shown. Tests are a bit harder and comprehensive, but make-up work was available to show that you know the material for bonus credit. Very helpful and teaches material well. Recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	727855	5/21/06	Galle is an excellent teacher who makes calculus interesting. I never liked math and never did well in calc in high school, but I enjoyed this class and learned a lot and am doing very well. She has a lot of enthusiasm even at 9am. I highly recommend her as a teacher for any math class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	727855	3/8/06	Really good teacher. Quizzes are multiple choice with partial credit. If the majority of the class did bad on a test she let the class do test corrections. Some down falls were that the homework was very difficult and graded very harsh, and workshops were very hard and fustrating. Overall, a good math teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	727855	10/25/05	She is a strict grader for the most part, but don't let that deter you. If you do the homework, go to class (and workshop), and you pay attention in class then you will end up with an A. The tests are fair, and overall she's a nice person, who will attempt to answer any question you might have. She definitely knows her material and how to teach it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	727855	10/17/05	She is very nice person. Makes the class interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	0	Mathematics	226	1	1	1	1	727855	1/29/08	Only if she improve her attitude on a one on one basis then it would be easy to learn. I would recommend her if you know a lot about Math, if not, she's not recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	3	727855	5/23/07	I'll start with me saying I'm not very good at math. I took Prof Galle for Calculus C and ended up not really liking her very much. She's nice, but homework is graded tough and she has a high school teacher mentality (no talking in the classroom, points off for being late, etc) and she can be quite annoying. Make up points on low exam ave happen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	727855	4/6/07	Galle is awesome! I am NOT good at math at all. I barely passed Algebra, and yet I'm taking Calculus now with Galle and it's whooping easy so far because she makes sure we understand & explains everything clearly! DEFINITELY A++++ for Galle!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	727855	8/8/06	Amazing person and teacher, a definate recommendation! She is a fair grader, often times offering bonuses, and if the class average on a test is low, she'll offer test corrections to boost grades and to try and improve understanding of the topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	727855	3/15/06	Extremely good teacher. I would definately recommend to anyone. She goes out of her way to try and make things interesting in class. Tests are moderately easy, sometimes with test corrections for bonus points. HW given once a week but collected and graded. HW is graded rough but doesn't hurt your avg much. I registered Calc C with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	727855	11/11/05	Professor Galle really loves math! you can tell with the manner that she presents the material for the class. If you show your work and show that you understand a concept, she'll give you credit. Also, she has no problem in helping you if you don't undestand a concept. I strongly recomend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gillian Galle	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	727855	10/22/05	I recommend her to anyone... she is a good professor.. and offers help...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amlan Ganguly	4.3	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1751541	2/12/13	Extremely helpful. Dow to Earth. Intelligent. Resourceful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amlan Ganguly	4.3	2	Engineering	561	4	4	4	4	1751541	10/3/12	Very good professor. Very willing to give outside help and explain things over again if need be. Also very understanding and patient. Good teacher and am looking forward to taking another class with him in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amlan Ganguly	4.3	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1751541	11/10/12	Really good professor. Knows a lot of VLSI and interconnect design. Easy on home-works and tests. Gives a lot of pop-quizzes. Need to be prepared for every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Ganster	2.5	1	Culinary Arts		5	3	3	3	1493241	2/24/13	I don't know why this guy has such bad reviews...he is unclear in his delivery of information and does not respond to e-mails in a timely manner, however if you do ask him a question and he can not help you he takes that into consideration with grading. If you attend class, listen, and put effort into your work you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Ganster	2.5	0	Culinary Arts		3	1	2	1	1493241	2/2/11	Extremely boring and confusing professor. Hes kind of young, and it seems like he wants to fit in with everybody, and it just doesn't work. Completely incomprehensible when teaching a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ted Ganster	2.5	1	Culinary Arts		4	3	3	4	1493241	3/8/11	He knows what he is talking about, but his delivery of the material is very rough. Kind of a strange personality and he usually seems overwhelmed. You constantly have to remind him of things. Don't expect a response if you email him for at least a week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Garrison	2.8	0	Psychology	443	4	2	2	4	1401453	11/3/10	Very nice and very helpful, but I don't think I could recommend him. Most classes lasted only an hour and some were canceled. It's hard to say I got my money's worth. RIT isn't cheap.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Garrison	2.8	2	Psychology	210	3	4	3	3	1401453	3/9/10	Lectures and slides get confusing, hard to follow his train of thought in class. Cool guy but just starting off, knows his stuff but is still learning how to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		3	5	5	5	1007078	4/18/11	Tom is probably the best animation professor, and human being, at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film	101	4	5	5	5	1007078	10/17/09	Tom is AMAZING. He is so helpful with everything, and you learn SO MUCH from him. He is one of the best teachers in SoFA. He may give you a considerable amount of work, but it is fair, and he grades fairly too. As long as you try your best, you will get good remarks and good grades. Tom is awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film	101	3	5	5	5	1007078	6/4/08	Great guy, really fun classes, great animator
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film	666	2	5	5	4	1007078	3/20/08	Tom is a great guy and an excellent resource
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1007078	7/9/07	Tom is the man! He's so helpful and really great at real knowledge for animators. He's worked with Creature Comforts with Aardman and he's got real professional experience. He is just a visiting Prof but I hope he sticks around as long as I'm here. If you're serious about animation, he's the guy to talk to and learn from! Friendly and encouraging!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1007078	10/23/09	I second the "God" comment. Does he know that every student idolizes him?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		3	5	5	5	1007078	4/22/09	God
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1007078	3/24/08	Tom is the best. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Gasek	4.9	2	Film		2	4	5	4	1007078	8/21/07	Tom is a great guy and I respect his opinions on my animations due to his years of work in the industry
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Gee	3.9	2	Engineering	415	5	5	5	5	1494333	3/12/12	Fluid Mechanics: He sets an easy pace and is easy to understand. Tests focus on core principals rather than anything abstract. Easy to get along with. Would highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Gee	3.9	1	Engineering	347	2	3	3	2	1494333	2/16/12	Nice guy, but not the greatest professor. Likes to repeat himself a lot and his notes can be pretty disorganized. He would always rush at the end which would make everything even more confusing. You really need to read the book if you want to learn the material and do well on the tests. I wouldn't take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Gee	3.9	2	Engineering		4	4	3	4	1494333	2/1/11	Great professor. Kept me awake by going through the material quickly and precisely. I am taking him again for Fluids. His tests were fairly easy but I took him when it wasn't common core tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Gee	3.9	2	Engineering	348	4	5	5	5	1494333	3/12/12	Mechanics of Materials: Dr. Gee is very good at teaching the material. He is easy to get hold of outside of class and is eager to offer help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Gee	3.9	1	Engineering		2	3	3	2	1494333	8/5/11	Great guy, writes really fast, OK at getting the material accross, He really wants you to do the HW. Tests were hard - he really wants to make you think - test questions weren't necessarilly like HW..he really stretched it. It was personally a very challenging class for me, got a C
Rochester Institute of Technology	Irina Georgieva	3.0	1	Not Specified		3	2	4	1	1750042	11/12/12	She only has you memorize 12 songs, and you're set to get A's on all the quizzes and finals. She's new, and it's definitely noticeable. You should read the book, but it's possible to ace the quizzes just by referring to the notes she posts online. The annoying thing is that she will just randomly call on students to do problems in front ofthe class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hamad Ghazle	5.0	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	5	1181559	2/3/10	Lover his students, cares about them. THE BEST EVER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hamad Ghazle	5.0	2	Imaging Science	101	4	5	5	5	1181559	11/6/08	The BEST professor that has ever lived!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	1402446	3/5/13	One of the nicest professors I've ever had. Very committed to making you learn and having a good class. Pay attention and you'll do okay, though tests can be tricky. Still, Amazing. Definitely take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	1402446	1/11/11	I try to get Hany for as many classes as possible. All 3 I've had were great. Easy A's because of his teaching. Well organized, happy to be there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	0	Engineering	865	2	1	2	2	1402446	2/24/10	Computer Implementation FEM: Commonly uses poor or incorrect English. Difficult to understand. Not tolerant in accepting late work. Work must be done using his process. If a student solves a problem differently, points are deducted.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	2	Engineering	870	4	5	5	5	1402446	4/19/11	This guy is a boss. He is by far one of the best teacher that I have ever had!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	2	Engineering	518	4	5	4	4	1402446	8/6/10	Hany is the man! Teaches extremely clearly and his office hours was helpful. He makes everything seem simple and I'll take him for any of my next classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hany Ghoneim	4.2	2	Engineering	347	2	4	4	3	1402446	1/26/10	Was very good at getting the class to understand the material. patient and careful in his explanations, quickly corrected any errors he made, and very excited about teaching. knows his stuff and willing to help. Gives quizzes to help back up information learned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Giancursio	4.0	2	Not Specified	211	5	4	4	4	1287051	11/12/12	Easy A class so long as you put in true effort whether you have skills or not. Explains techniques and you draw for however long it takes(about 2 hrs or less) and class dismissed. He plays a variety of inspiring music from different genres. A very calming class to get away from tech fields and get an elective out of the way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Giancursio	4.0	1	Not Specified		3	3	3	3	1287051	5/15/09	ummmmmmmmmmm good class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Giancursio	4.0	2	Not Specified	102	3	5	5	3	1287051	1/20/10	What a great professor, he's very open and for drawing atleast, he pretty much just explains the assignment and then you just... draw... for the rest of the class... he's super laid-back and nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		4	5	4	4	563850	9/30/10	Professor Gilberg is wonderful. The first day of class I got mad when she made me put my new laptop away, but by the end of the quarter I was a stronger writer and loved to bust out my pen and paper. She was encouraging, gave great feedback, & supported a positive atmosphere among all the students in her class, many of whom I'm still friends with!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature	227	4	5	4	1	563850	5/13/09	Super nice lady, very laid back. Open-minded and lets you speak uncensored
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		5	5	5	5	563850	11/6/08	Really nice, fun, interesting topics and classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		5	5	5	3	563850	2/24/08	Gail is great, she really wants you to be a better writer, there are a lot of discussions in her class about interesting topics. The texts she chose were interesting. If you have trouble getting into a "choice" AOE class, take one w/ her, you won't regret it. You will have to work though and demonstrate some knowledge of topics discussed in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		4	5	5	5	563850	2/22/06	Crazy in a good way. Moves class outside when it's nice out, has extremely open-ended assignments, and holds her office hours in Java Wally's. Definitely take her if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		4	5	5	3	563850	3/3/10	Very nice lady, very understanding that college life is hard. She will allow you to always speak your mind and her assignments are pretty straightforward. If you know how to write you have an easy B. If you read the assigned book when she says you have an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	0	Literature		1	1	2	3	563850	2/4/09	terrible teacher, makes you do pointless assignments in Writing Seminar. DO NOT take her if you are forced to take Writing Seminar
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		4	4	4	2	563850	5/12/08	Professor Gilberg's class is pretty interesting. The readings are actually entertaining and not dry. You have to write two papers which aren't bad since you do a bunch of editing on them in class. You also have to do a creative art project which was easy. She can be a tough grader, but overall good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		3	4	5	5	563850	2/5/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Gilberg	4.2	2	Literature		3	4	3	3	563850	1/31/05	Gail is a fun teacher, the class was laid back, but she really tries to make a you a better writer over, while being tolerant of all different styles. She lets you write about almost anything you want, as long as you can tie it to the common topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wendy Gilmore	4.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	1	1653230	2/8/12	FYE is not much of a real class, therefore it is easy. She is alright.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics	101	3	3	2	5	604820	11/17/12	Very confusing to listen to her confuse herself. She is very nice and will help you if you go to her office hours. GO TO "SI" MEETINGS if they are available. If you have prior micro experience its relatively easy to get an A, but if not its very confusing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics		5	3	3	4	604820	10/24/12	her class is sooooooo boring and goes obnoxiously slow but the class is very easy. if you know some economics before hand, you will get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics		4	2	2	1	604820	4/23/11	Not very good teacher, did not explain material well. Homework was few and not very difficult. Her tests and quizzes where only hard because of her poor teaching skills and was heavily curved.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics		3	3	3	1	604820	1/26/11	Attendance is optional and there is no textbook whatsoever, so don't bother buying it, as she's "required" to choose one. She's a little hard to follow and 90% of your grade is made up of the three exams, which are heavily curved.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics		3	3	3	3	604820	2/16/10	Nice lady, though very confused. Confused about what she is teaching, kind of funny to watch because she is so awkward. If you take her ask alot of questions in class or y ou will not understand what the heck she is talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics		2	4	4	2	604820	2/2/09	She is extremely helpful outside of class and truly wants her students to succeed. Her tests, though, are pretty difficult and attendance is totally optional. Sometimes people who didn't go to class scored higher because all of the lecture notes are online and she can often be repetitive or well... boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics	511	4	5	4	3	604820	11/7/07	Needed an econ class, glad I took urban econ with Gleeson, she was good and class didn't require knowing prev econ concepts much. She would ask input during topic discussions, posted lecture notes & example exams for review before tests, + points for going to econ lectures also. She was nice and yes-she did smile sometimes :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics	457	4	3	4	2	604820	4/25/07	Tests are strongly based on old tests (posted online) and review sheets. Can ramble in class, but is nice in general.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics	457	4	4	3	2	604820	4/19/07	If you know the material on the review sheets, you'll get a good grade. Ok face, perfect behind. Lectures can be somewhat boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics	402	2	1	1	3	604820	2/11/07	I advise everyone NOT to take Gleeson! She's very confusing, teaches us long procedures and then ends up telling us she tought us the wrong thing, it's IMPOSSIBLE to pay attention during class (so no one ever knows what's going on), her tests are very difficult and her sample tests don't help at all. She's the worst techer I've ever had in my life!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics		2	2	1	2	604820	11/16/12	Horrible. Couldn't pay attention in class because listening to her made me more confused. She confuses herself. No idea what she's doing and impossible to decipher what comes out of her mouth. Only went because of the participation assignment she does every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics		3	3	2	2	604820	5/13/12	Applied Econometrics. Dr. Gleeson was not a very effective teacher in class, but was helpful outside of class. She often confuses herself in class, which confuses everybody else (as someone else said) and her presentation is not very clear. Derivations done in class are not needed for tests, and they are 90% of class time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics	457	2	5	3	4	604820	3/12/11	A tough course, essentially felt like data analysis 3 with a lot more logic thrown in. The information is quite dry I usually went in on a double shot espresso in coffee. Bri is quite helpful outside of the class and will go to lengths to help you understand the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics		2	3	5	3	604820	10/25/10	Good teacher, she explains things very well, the book is helpful too. Not the most humorous or engaging teacher ever, but she makes sense. Exams are tough, because she makes you take what you have learned and apply it a step further. But she normally curves the exam grades. Attendance optional but you could miss assignments which are 10% of grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics		1	3	1	4	604820	7/22/09	HORRIBLE! It's the first C I've ever gotten in my life, and the class was miserable. I attended almost every lecture and looked at the notes outside of class, and it was useless. She was very pregnant during the semester which might have affected her ability to teach, but I don't suggest taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics	211	1	1	1	4	604820	10/22/08	Alright, so this teacher is the worst teacher I've ever had. If I had a teacher that just posted homework/notes/examples online and didn't lecture at all, I'd learn more. A fellow classmate actually scored high when he didn't attend. She's boring,complicated, and re-iterates supply n demand x10000. Even if you have to wait a quarter, DO NOT TAKE!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics		3	4	4	2	604820	10/14/07	Despite some of the ratings, she does explain the material very well and answers questions if you ask. You may need to put in some effort to understand the topics, but her practice tests and examples are are pretty representative of what's on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics	101	2	1	2	1	604820	4/23/07	Her tests are difficult and slightly obscure so she has to curve the tests huge amounts, the manner in which she teaches is useless (all she does is talk, and talk and talk from a powerpoint), and she just seems like a rather miserable human being. Don't take her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics	101	4	2	2	1	604820	3/7/07	She really understand econ, but she confuses herself in class often, which confuses entire class. Attendence is not mandatory. Don't bother buying the text, dont use it at all. Curves tests so class average is a 80.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics		4	4	3	3	604820	1/25/07	Class itself was uninteresting, however, she did an adequate job of presenting the material. Posts practice tests online that have similar questions to those you will see on the real thing. Moderate grader. Lecture will put you to sleep. Overall grade: B-
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics		2	1	1	5	604820	11/12/06	Makes no sense in class. Is little to no help out of class as well. I liked econ, but after this class, I know nothing about it. Never smiles, gives insanely hard tests, and doesn't cover anything of relevance in class. Do NOT take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	0	Economics		1	1	1	1	604820	9/11/05	*sighs* this teacher didn't explain the curriculium correctly. she rarely smiles. she makes alot of notes that we as the students cannot understand, even though, they are damn too long that make our hands worn out. all i can say is she's an uneasy teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	2	Economics		2	4	3	3	604820	11/17/05	Her lectures are just hours of notes, but what do you want from an econ course? A trip to the zoo? Test were fairly easy as she always posted practice exams online that were always VERY similar to the test. Certainly not a very charasmatic teacher, but effective none the less.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brid Gleeson	2.7	1	Economics		2	3	2	2	604820	4/25/05	Do not get her. She just writes stuff on the board for hours straight, that when it comes to the test, does not even make sense. Her tests are unneccessarily hard and her class is boring. Also, I've never seen her smile.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	1	Art History	222	4	3	3	3	877618	4/1/13	She was a good professor, but when it comes to grades, it was bad. I couldn't point on it because she kept changing the grade point. I was frustrated with that because I thought I would get an A from this class, but instead, I got a B. Just saying my opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	0	Art History		1	2	2	3	877618	4/30/11	Class was required, and guidelines were totally unclear. expectations changed every week, there was frustration on both sides. Prof not willing to address problems before they become unmanageable. Very stressful experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	0	Art History	505	1	1	2	4	877618	2/28/10	VERY TIME CONSUMING.TONS of reading & articles online & very little teaching by Goins.Two papers(10 pg/ea.) Final exam was horrible-we had to id pigments, radio carbon dating (which she gave us about 15 min to learn & that was it & would not go over it again before exam)because of limited space labs were every other wk instead of every wk. Terrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	1	Art History	505	1	2	3	2	877618	2/16/09	Provides articles on myCourses every week and expects you to complete homework on it. Some articles is more than 20 pgs long and you must read 3 to 10 articles each week. A presentation is required and a ten pages final project. When I had asked the teach for help, she had an attitude and was not interested in helping me pass. Very time consuming
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	2	Art History		4	5	4	3	877618	11/21/06	A little dull, but her videos are very entertaining and the class mostly consists of private art outlines. They are rather simple and can be quickly done. She's very friendly and extremely helpful... also each extra credit is approx. 10 points on a test, well worth doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	0	Art History	101	1	1	1	3	877618	5/4/11	She really was not interested in helping her students. She is more interested in her own projects. I would not recommend taking a class with her unless you absolutely have to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	0	Art History		1	2	2	5	877618	4/6/10	She is very unclear about expectations and will give low grades even when you do the work asked of you. Changes answer to same question about work depending on who asks them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	2	Art History	423	4	5	5	2	877618	3/12/09	I had no idea what I was doing going into this class, with no painting experience whatsoever, but Prof. Goins is very helpful and concerned, and her projects were fun and interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Goins	2.9	2	Art History	213	4	5	4	5	877618	11/9/08	Amazing class. I enjoyed ever one of them. Workload is acceptable and discussions during class time were very thought provoking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies	101	2	5	5	4	1187387	2/21/13	An awesome teacher. I've had him for geology, hydrology, and em&m. It's really hard to get an A in his class, and his tests are brutal. However, you learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		2	5	4	4	1187387	10/18/11	Awesome Professor. Doesnt lecture off of power points but must take notes in class! You have to work for your grade but you learn a lot. Awesome class and fun labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		2	5	4	4	1187387	9/5/11	Great prof. Tests are really hard but you can do well if you study. He is really nice, and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies	308	2	3	4	5	1187387	4/13/10	I have had Josh for both Env. Geology and Hydrology. He is interesting during lecture but leaves room open to give you a lower grade if he feels like you are not doing enough. His tests are quite hard if you don't study and a lot of lecture topics never show up on the tests. Expect to spend a lot of time on homework and labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		2	5	4	5	1187387	10/16/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies	370	1	5	5	2	1187387	5/22/12	Nice guy, easy to approach, but VERY hard. The class bombed almost every quiz and needed either a curve or the option to do corrections. Take good notes, study them regularly, and read the book because he throws questions from it on the quiz. I wouldn't suggest taking this as your lab requirement, take only if necessary or genuinely interested.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		4	5	5	5	1187387	10/17/11	I've had Goldowitz for Geology and Hydrology and he is an amazing professor. His classes aren't easy but they're really enjoyable. Easily my favorite professor!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		2	5	5	5	1187387	7/14/11	Josh is an absolutely amazing teacher. Smart, uses personal experience and very helpful when you ask. His test are difficult so take good notes and STUDY! What you learn in his class is fun, interesting, and can be directly applied to a co-op or job. Awesome teacher all around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Goldowitz	4.7	2	Environmental Studies		4	5	5	3	1187387	11/17/08	Best professor ever! Enough said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deb  Gears	4.5	2	Information Technology	461	2	5	4	5	1794358	1/24/13	She knows Data Modeling well and is very willing to answer questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	5	247860	3/6/13	Best professor, makes you learn the concepts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	4	247860	3/13/12	The professor really liked the topic, and the class was easy (a little too easy in my opinion). Class consisted of a mini project each week, as well as discussions and two exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	5	3	247860	12/3/09	Evolutionary Algorithms. Class was easy, lectures were pretty interesting for a CS class. No tests, only meaningful projects. You're guaranteed to learn a lot, if you do the work. Geigel is a good lecturer, and tries to spice things up with videos, guest speakers, etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	247860	11/25/06	great guy. i've had him for multiple classes and have enjoyed him every time. he's consistent and fair. he's always been approachable for me, and if you're having trouble he will work with you. he has all his notes online and they're very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	3	247860	8/12/05	Useless professor. The only things I learned in the class were from the textbook and other CS4 professor's slides (so if you have him...make sure you get the book). I ended up going to other non-CS professors for help, because nobody in the department had a clue how to help his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	5	NULL	247860	3/31/04	Best CS prof I've had yet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	247860	2/4/13	Very thorough with explaining the concepts and giving out assignments. Doesn't let you worry about the marks, just makes sure you understand the concept in detail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	247860	2/27/12	Excellent professor. My favorite so far!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science	769	5	4	4	5	247860	4/17/08	Nice guy, popular for setting up the great and painful CG2 course(if u know what i mean). Knows his stuff, helpful might be a little unclear during class but helps outside class so its even..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	4	5	247860	8/3/06	Extremely nice professor. Good structure and layout of the class. Will guide you toward an answer but not outright explain each step. While it may be challenging, it helps with learning the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	NULL	247860	4/19/04	Useless with CS4. I had to go outside the department for help because he spent an hour staring at my code, then took a cell phone call and left. He's nice but clueless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Geigel	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	NULL	247860	9/10/03	He's a nice guy and has a very structured class setting (i.e. he lays out what you need to know in PowerPoint presentation notes). He is sometimes unclear and unavailable for questions, but when he is available, he is very approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business		1	2	2	3	989399	10/26/09	I had him for an online Small Business class. TERRIBLE. After having a family emergency and trying to reason with him about missing a test, he told me I actually made the test a low priority. I was shocked a teacher could say this to one of their students that they've never even met.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business	111	1	1	1	3	989399	5/15/09	I aggree with all of the prior post here. Horrible teacher if you can call him that. Assignments are useless. Since I had an online class with him I assume it was much worse than it had to be. Never knew what was due or when It was due except when it was too late. If you ask him questions he is just very dismissive never really answers your questio
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business		3	1	1	3	989399	3/12/08	It's impossible to understand what he wants from his assignments. They are vague and ambiguous beyond belief. His book is the same way. I am taking an online class with him that is taking up more of my "set-aside" time than regular classes. He requires students to be at chats during the week and to drive around town doing assignments. Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business		2	1	1	4	989399	10/3/09	AVOID! I can't stress this enough. He is the author of the required text, its a terrible book of no use that is extremely overpriced. If you are lucky enough to be able to decipher what assignments are due, you won't be able to figure out what the assignment actually is. He is quite possibly the worst professor I have ever had, he should be fired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business		2	1	1	4	989399	4/10/08	Gosh, where do I start. He's one of those profs that will make you pull your hair right out of your head. Unclear, incoherent, vague, confusing. You don't know what his expectations are because you can't. Completely ambiguous individual. Assignments are unrealistic. Avoid him like the plague. One of my worst experiences as a student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Gerace	1.2	0	Business	223	2	1	1	3	989399	5/9/07	professor should not be teaching.his text is overpriced and is of little value.he wrote the text and thinks it to be good. its not! Avoid taking a class with this teacher at all costs. 4hr classes plus a dull presenter that refuses to use modern technology.his assignments are completely vague and unclear, causing much confusion. avoid avoid aviod.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ghertner	4.0	2	Film		3	5	4	5	1032739	2/4/09	EXTREMELY nice lady. She knows what she's talking about, and she genuinely cares about her students. HIGHLY recommend!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ghertner	4.0	1	Film		5	3	3	2	1032739	3/24/08	She's a sweetheart and fairly knowledgeable. She makes every effort to be helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Ghertner	4.0	2	Film	102	4	5	4	3	1032739	4/29/08	Nicest lady. A little out there, but will try her best to help you out. Encourages you to work with your ideas from the beginning instead of criticizing the concept like most Prod 1/2 teachers. I wish she taught more classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	2	Engineering	359	1	5	4	3	808742	1/14/13	Dynamics teacher, very knowledgable about all topics, statics, dynamics, fluids, etc. Teaches through examples mainly, book is mandatory or else you will get left behind copying problems from a friends book. Tests are killer, but he prepares you very well with overloads of examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	0	Engineering	550	1	2	2	1	808742	4/28/07	Trnasport Phenomena was a very ineteresting class, but I thought Ghosh was a bad choice of professor. His notes were all over the place and very hard to follow his train of thought. Quiz every week that counted for 30% of grade. Quizzes extremely difficult as well as exams. Core class but try to take from someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	0	Engineering		1	2	1	5	808742	2/8/06	Nobody I know has above a C in his class. Teaches things differently than I have seen before. Yes, he is knowledable, but there is never enough time for tests or quizzes, and they are extremely hard compared to what is covered in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	808742	10/15/12	dont skip class and pay attention and your good. This prof is AMAZING I had him for statics and I plan on taking all of the other MechE classes he teaches I wish he taught them all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	0	Engineering	336	1	1	1	1	808742	11/27/06	This guy is a JERK! He will take ALWAYS give you some ridiculous trig problem to solve in each problem before you can even get to the statics (which you wont). He is also extremly NOT helpful outside of his class where he will refer you to his website then tell you not to learn anything from his website. He should not be a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amitabha Ghosh	3.1	2	Engineering		3	5	4	4	808742	2/7/06	Good professor, somewhat difficult, but he's very knowledgable and you learn alot. (we were almost twice as far as other classes with different professors, and no one in our class was lost)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	2	Business	740	4	4	4	4	1109422	11/17/11	Refreshing teacher. Incorporated real world experience with thought-provoking readings. Very good class for liberal arts backgrounds. Keep up with the readings, talk in class, write your (reflection) paper=A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	2	Business	741	3	3	4	4	1109422	3/1/09	The professor was great but his teaching style was unconventional. Required books cost a good amount of money, thought there might have been a few too many books. However, the books were utilized in one way or another throughout the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	0	Business	810	5	1	2	3	1109422	12/5/08	I am glad this class is over. Wasn't my cup of tea.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	2	Business	763	3	3	4	4	1109422	5/25/09	Read all required texts ahead of class so you could engage in meaningful discussions in class. Once more, reading the assigned chapters before class is crucial if you want an A. When discussing in class and when writing the papers/homeworks, explicitly link the concepts from the text to your findings. For instance, "I have personally found that
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	0	Business	101	5	1	2	1	1109422	12/6/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Giarrusso	3.2	2	Business	740	4	5	5	4	1109422	11/21/08	Great class to know thy self & how to broaded your scope when thinking in a group dynamics perspective. WARNING: I read (6) books in (10) weeks. Non-readers beware!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Gilbert	4.5	2	Mathematics	101	1	5	4	1	976511	4/26/11	Professor Gilbert was amazingly helpful and will work with you until you understand it. We used MathXL and it's a great software program for those who don't have a lot of math experience. Overall, I would definitely recommend him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Gilbert	4.5	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	1	976511	4/12/07	This course was tough (for me) but the professor was clear and cool to work with. He was forgiving when I had health problems during the quarter and allowed me to make up the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Gilbert	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	976511	3/7/09	He is a great professor, and will work with anyone to make sure you pass. I had issues at the beginning of the quarter and he let me make up all my work. He also worked with me after tests to bring my grade up, he is willing to do anything to get the grade you want. Take this class!! (and i HATE math)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	852525	5/15/12	I'm currently taking classes with Prof. Glanton. He's one of the best Math Teaches I ever had. He explains VERY well and actually cares that EVERYONE learns. Extremely helpful at anytime. His class, however, require some work. You need to solve the semi-daily homework to get an A. GREAT PROFESSOR! RECOMMENDED FOR ANY CALC COURSE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	5	852525	2/8/12	great math teacher. easy A if you study for the weekly quizzes. homework not graded but i would still do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	123	4	5	5	5	852525	11/12/11	One of the best math teachers I have had. Explains everything very clear and is always willing to help. Unfortunately, I do agree with Straight A, Mr Glanton is pretty harsh with the notation. I got a 94 instead of 100 for not writing limh->0 for every line.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	5	3	852525	9/8/11	This guy is the man. Had him last year for calc A, B, and C and he rocks. Very helpful and will take the time to help you until you get it. Very friendly and funny guy. Take him if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	852525	2/2/11	He's an awesome professor. He gives enough homework to get you to learn it, but doesn't grade you directly on it. A weekly exam of some sort is given, and those questions come straight from the homework. If you do the homework, you will pass. Tests generally are on the short side though..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	272	3	4	5	3	852525	1/27/11	Explains content well, quiz questions every week come directly from the homework problems. Tests and quizzes have few questions, so points get dropped often for little mistakes but other than that no complaints. Grades are consistently returned within a day or two.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	852525	10/27/10	He gives assignments every class and quizzes every week. If you do your assignments, you do well on the quizzes. If you do well on the quizzes, you do well on the tests, etc. He is a good teacher. You get what you put in!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	225	3	4	5	2	852525	3/9/10	Lectures clearly and goes at a good pace. 6 HW quizes, drops the lowest 2. Those who got C's probably didn't do the homework. HW amount is very reasonable. He's not a hard grader, but you can miss points if you get 1 question wrong, because there are only like 5 on a quiz. I'm not good at math, but he made all the difference. Take him if u can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	226	3	5	4	2	852525	2/13/10	Overall goof professor with one exception, he it a terribly strict grader! His tests usually have one four questions and the entire courses grade is based on 3 tests, 6 quizzes, and one final. It's easy to lose half the points on a question just with by not using his preferred notation. Get one question wrong and you're looking at a C on the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	852525	2/10/09	Never taken it before this class. Excellent professor. Makes calc seem easy. Tests are fair. HW Quiz every week. Con: Grade strictly dependent on test grades. If you're a bad test taker, you better study hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	852525	5/1/12	Simply, Great Professor. He teaches very well and very helpful during class time or his office hours. Tests and Quiz's are usually based on the homework. If you you do your part (studying at least an hour a day) it would be easy to get at least a B. Nice guy and funny sometimes. Take him for Calc A, B or C. He's VERY strict on notation, I mean VERY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	2	5	4	852525	2/2/12	Very harsh on notations. Do your homework because he gives quizzes every Friday and they are all homework questions. Sometimes he over explains stuff, but overall he is a decent teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	271	3	5	5	4	852525	11/9/11	Always willing to help and provide examples. Tests and quizzes never unreasonable, homework optional (but expect your grades to slip if you don't do it).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	852525	4/7/11	He talks a lot, so much so that it may get annoying if you're an impatient person like I am, but he means well. Picky about how you write things like fractions. Tests aren't bad, usually under 10 questions. Doesn't collect homework, just gives weekly quizzes with questions directly from assignments instead. Overall a pretty decent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	101	3	5	4	3	852525	2/1/11	Of course it won't be the most interesting class...its calc, but he is a good professor and I would suggest if you can get into his class you should.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	3	852525	11/21/10	While boring at times (it's a calc class), it was a good class. Very easy - quizzes are based off of homework, lowest 2 quiz grades are dropped, tests aren't bad either. As long as you do the homework (maybe about an hour of work every other day) you'll be fine. Glanton is helpful with any questions you have, so ask them!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	101	2	3	4	1	852525	9/20/10	Very strict grader to a stupid extent. Quizzes only have 5 questions so if you mess up once you're done, and he will catch you on the smallest things. Literally just failed a quiz because I used a decimal instead of a fraction, even though I got the right answer and the question did not ask for a fraction. He also lies about giving partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	852525	2/28/10	Awesome teacher, VERY helpful outside of class. Fair grader, lets you know exactly what procedures to use and just "what he's looking for" on exams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	231	4	5	5	4	852525	11/30/09	very good professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	852525	11/17/08	Awesome. Very comprehensive. Willing to help. Not a hard grader. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	852525	5/19/08	Excellent professor, will work with you to help you get the grade you need, fair grading, very nice guy. definitely take his class if you are able to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	226	5	4	5	3	852525	2/5/08	really great teacher and class is every easy. Did a better job than my high school AP cal teacher. Clear and every helpful. Test and Quiz are easy but maybe cuz I'm Asian cuz the person sitting next to me fail. LOL
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	852525	2/15/07	Great professor. Thouroughly explains what he is teaching and does it well. Highly recommended for any math class he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	215	5	5	5	5	852525	2/5/07	He is a great teacher. Awesome. Very easy...just do your HW and u'll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	852525	12/4/06	Good teacher. take him easy homework easy everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	3	5	5	852525	9/17/06	I have him in Calculus for Management. He is a very good teacher. Above all he is a fair guy. Do your homework and you will have a straight A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	262	4	5	5	4	852525	2/21/08	I love him. He's incredibly nice, very forgiving, and is even fun to watch. There's homework every night, but it's nothing unmanageable. He's great at explaining problems and wants his students to do as best they can. Probably the best class I've taken so far at RIT. Don't miss out on this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics	215	4	5	4	4	852525	8/22/07	Great teacher. One of the harder Elementary Calc teachers, but definitely worth it. Just do the hw and ask questions if you don't understand something. Study the night before (the hw and quizzes) and you'll get an A easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	852525	2/7/07	Very helpful. Do the assigned homework, which isn't mandatory, and you will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	852525	12/6/06	Prof. Glanton was very nice. He would help you as much as he could. I went to alot of his office hours and he was very helpful! Do well on homework quizes, and you will ace this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	852525	11/16/06	I had him in both Elementary Calculus I and II. Overall, he's a good and a very fair teacher. The only drawback about him is he can be boring at some times. DEFINITELY do your homework since some of the questions on the quizzes (given once every week) are exactly the same as the homework assignments. Only three tests and a cumulative final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dennis Glanton	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	1	852525	5/24/06	Im not good at math at all and he seems to be an alright teacher for people who arent too strong at math. 1 quiz every week (questions are always off your homework though, so if you do your homework, you'll be set) 3 tests and a cummulative final. Homework everynight, but he doesnt check it, but its in your best intrest to do it. Overall, good guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ashok Godambe	5.0	2	Engineering	300	5	5	5	5	840561	5/11/08	Excellent Professor. One of the best I have ever had. He takes a lot of time to meet with students that are having difficulties or have questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Goldberg	4.4	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	3	1219039	2/8/13	Great teacher - down to earth and always helpful! Class is not tough, so there should be no issues at all. Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Goldberg	4.4	2	Graphic Arts		2	2	5	2	1219039	12/2/08	This guy loves to talk. Boring class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Goldberg	4.4	2	Graphic Arts	123	4	5	5	1	1219039	2/8/13	I just had him for freshman seminar (aka Discovery at RIT.) He's a really nice guy, and there's barely any work, so don't expect any problems here. Weirdest laugh I have ever heard come out of a human being, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erik Golen	3.2	2	Computer Science	220	4	4	4	5	1178488	10/10/08	Erik has spent 8 years at RIT and has taught 1. He's nervous as hell. Final paper is the only big deal about this course and he can be unhelpful about it. A sleep class, puts all powerpoints online
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erik Golen	3.2	1	Computer Science		5	2	3	2	1178488	9/12/08	Unexperienced teacher, unsure of the material he is teaching, most everything is tentative, almost seems like he's just making it up as he goes along. Easy A but you won't learn alot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1388900	3/2/13	Great professor! Very helpful! Connects to his students on the personal level (out of a class of 73).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	1388900	1/21/13	He's a good prof, a good guy, and very smart. Very reasonable and accommodating. Hes good at explaining things, and using physical demos or videos to explain things. I consider taking any class he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering	359	4	5	5	4	1388900	4/13/10	I've had this teacher for the entire Statics-Mechanics-Dynamics sequence. He brings in tangible examples and tries to learn every student's name. He actually wants his students to learn and is willing to give any extra help. Although he doesn't have much control over the tests it has seemed like he is responsible for the more reasonable question
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	1388900	1/28/13	Good guy and professor. Very friendly and approachable. While he isn't the easiest professor, I would take him again and recommend him to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering	359	3	5	5	4	1388900	4/20/10	I had him for statics, mechanics, and dynamics. He's extremely helpful, has a good sense of humor and very friendly. He's very good about in-class example problems and demonstration of concepts. I strongly recommend him for engineering classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mario Gomes	5.0	2	Engineering	343	4	5	5	4	1388900	2/20/10	Excellent professor. Explains things very thoroughly and with plenty of examples. He encourages questions and is willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	3	663617	1/24/13	Worst Programming Teacher, I had Joe Pietruch first, and it was such a drop off in quality going to Gordon. I recommend anyone looking at programming to wait for a class taught by Joe because he is so much better than Gordon. Gordon is incoherent and is boring. The code he supplies runs on forever, and has more comments than content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science	101	1	1	1	1	663617	5/12/12	I don't mean to be mean, but this man has no business teaching. His presentations were dreadful to the point I'd rather endure physical pain. He didn't teach whatever the class was supposed to go over, but instead pushed some agenda of his upon us. I've taken two of his classes now, and regret doing so both times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	4	663617	2/15/11	WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. he zones out during class also and if you even look away from the screen for a second, he does something and while you are copying it down,he switches screens so you cant do anything. I warn ALL NMD students: DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science	295	5	1	1	5	663617	11/14/10	He has to have been the worst professor/teacher I have ever had. Always shows up late to class, hands back grades days before revisions are due (when other sec's have had theirs back for weeks). Almost impossible to get a hold of and never explains his grades no matter how many times you beat his door down. Stay away from this joke of a professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	663617	2/1/09	hands down WORST professor at RIT. knows what hes doing but royally fails at relaying to it anyone else. classes consist of frantically trying to copy his code down before he switches screens and moves on to something else. you have no time to actually learn anything. i've even tried the sit back and listen approach no copying code but absorbed nad
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	4	663617	5/25/07	Gordon Goodman is a seemingly nice individual. This being said it takes more than this to be able to teach a class in computer programming. His class had little value and I didn't feel like I walked away with anything useful. He doesn't put up grades frequently at all. His classwork was us copying his code verbatim. I unlearned things I alreadyknew
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science	231	1	1	1	5	663617	4/3/07	Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. He doesn't teach - he does everything himself and makes everyone copy him. His voice is monotone. I want to kill myself when i'm in his classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	663617	11/29/05	Worst professor I've had at RIT. No grades. No project requirements. Plus he makes derogotory comments and hates minorities.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science	295	4	1	1	3	663617	11/20/12	Terrible teacher all around. Although the class is not hard, there is overall very little graded work, but he takes extreme amounts of time to grade assignments. He is monotone and rambles incoherently. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	663617	11/29/11	Literally the worst teacher I've had. It took him so long to grade projects that he had to give everyone a pass/fail, based on like 2 minutes of observation, in order to meet the grading deadline. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	2	663617	2/4/11	DONT TAKE THIS PROF if you are a NMD student. You will learn NOTHING. Does not teach & grades VERY harsh. Refuses to answer emails. Grades are not posted until MONTHS later. Got our grades for the 1st project the DAY BEFORE withdraw deadline(WEEK 8!) - only after complaints to his boss. Other section has all A's and B's - our sect. has C's and D's.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		4	2	2	3	663617	4/6/09	One of the most boring teachers I've ever had. He is CONSTANTLY unprepared and bores you to death with his lectures. He talks the whole time and we copy his code verbatim. He could spend ten minutes explaining something that would take a normal person one. He forgets to post code after classes, talks with his eyes closed, etc. AvoidThisClassIfUCan
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	4	663617	7/22/07	He seems like a decent person and is willing to help if you approach him. I'm sure he knows what he is doing but he doesn't know how to relay the information. He gives guidelines on what he wants in projects but he doesn't give grades back. Do not take him if you need things clearly explained and you don't like learning mostly on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	663617	5/6/07	Without comparison, the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. Has absolutely NO knowledge of the subject he teaches, and constantly comes to class unprepared. Most often we spend classes attempting to debug the shoddy program he cooked up 5 minutes before he showed up. No grades until it was too late to drop. Dont give this guy ur money.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gordon Goodman	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	663617	12/5/05	Worst Professor EVER. No Grades. No Projects. MEAN!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Goodwin	3.5	1	Engineering		4	2	4	3	340584	10/22/12	The class is very boring. Goodwin is long winded and generally drones on but he's not terrible. Tests were super easy but he grades labs poorly. He starts you out at 80 and then gives you an arbitrary # of pts back if he likes it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Goodwin	3.5	2	Engineering		2	4	4	4	340584	6/16/05	Tough class, but Goodwin worked hard to help me
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Gordon	3.4	2	Engineering	405	3	5	5	4	677056	10/21/08	Great teacher for a subject that is not so easy. Have never had any issues with him. Very helpful and wants students to come see him. Tests are right out of the material we are learning and there are no insane problems. Allows you to skip final if have an A average when time comes to take it. Makes working hard worth it! Will take him for Thermo!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Gordon	3.4	2	Engineering		3	3	4	4	677056	1/27/08	Decent professor. Teaches using a lot of example problems. Tests are pretty straightforward. Tends to frown upon questions that are easy to him, but hard to you. Other than that, pretty good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Gordon	3.4	2	Engineering	405	3	5	4	5	677056	10/24/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Gordon	3.4	1	Engineering		3	2	3	4	677056	6/24/08	First, I had him for Dynamics and didnt like his style at all. I felt like if you asked questions that was hard to you and easy to him, he had mentality like, "Im teaching this why dont you understand it." I took Thermo next quarter and had more success. I felt maybe thermo was more his area, he did a better job with it and theings seemed smoother.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Gordon	3.4	0	Engineering		3	1	2	3	677056	2/4/07	Had him for dynamics and thermo. Horrible. When to his office, waited for a half hour while he yacked on the phone. Sometimes not in his office during office hours. Asking him for help on the homework is usually slow and not informative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Gould	3.8	1	Design	101	1	3	3	4	1075130	10/21/08	so sexy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Gould	3.8	2	Design	402	3	5	4	4	1075130	12/13/07	The class wasn't hard but it did take a good amount of effort on my part.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathryn  Graf	5.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1756827	12/4/12	she is very helpful, all students like her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathryn  Graf	5.0	2	Mathematics	200	5	5	5	2	1756827	10/24/12	Amazing Teacher very clear in assignments all HW is on My math lab and is graded on compleation not what you scored. tests are not bad if you pay attention in class and take notes and write down the examples. usually only lectures for an hr then gives you group work & u can leave when your done.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	982669	10/11/11	Mr. Chad Gratton is the man. This guy knows what he is talking about. A genius at heart, sometimes he even takes it upon himself to bake cookies for the smart students in class. . His Discrete math section is literally so discrete, that if you're failing, no one will ever find out. Realistically, he is really a good teacher, would highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	206	4	5	4	3	982669	7/21/09	Chad was an awesome discrete teacher! He is always available for help during office hours and graded very fair. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	5	4	982669	2/19/09	Chad is the man. Take discrete with him, he knows EVERYTHING, and is very helpful when you have questions. The grading curve is also very generous. I highly recommend taking a class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	1	Mathematics	204	2	3	2	1	982669	4/23/08	Chad definitely knows EXACTLY what he is doing, however none of the students do. He is a grad student in math and I don't think anyone has taught him how to teach yet. His material is VERY complex and he doesn't have a good way of explaining it. He rarely uses numbers in examples and usually prefers obscure mathematical symbols and bad wording.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	206	3	5	4	1	982669	11/8/07	Very nice, fair, and enthusiastic teacher! His material is quite difficult which is unfortunately unnecessary for most students that are taking the class who will honestly probably never use the skills and just forget them as soon as the class is over. It's a lot of work to do well, but he has a good curve and you can do well if you work at it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	2	982669	9/6/07	Chad is great, he is a UofR grad student working on his PHD in math. He knows his stuff. He really helped out a lot. There is a very very generous curve and he is always willing to help. We had review sessions on the weekend. He is great and I learned a lot about a tough subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	700	3	5	5	5	982669	12/2/09	He presents material clearly and moves through at an excellent pace. Homeworks are not necessary and just for practice. He'll always take time out of class (or office hours) to answer questions. Very fair. He'll give credit where he can. Overall one of the best professors I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	5	982669	5/19/09	Chad is a great professor. I've had him for Discrete I and II and have learned so much and have no been overwhelmed with homework. His balance of homework and quizzes is perfect and teaching style is great. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	5	5	982669	2/9/09	Take Chad for Discrete I and II. His teaching style is amazing and grading scale is very fair. He will get you through Discrete. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	2	982669	4/3/08	I would NEVER recommend taking a class with Mr. Gratton. I had a starting class size of over 35, about 15-20 students are still in the class. I felt as if I was in HS again b/c everyone just laughed and joked about the material because he was trying to teach material that would take DAYS to learn in MINUTES! His past discrete class average was a 50
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Gratton	4.3	2	Mathematics	316	3	5	5	1	982669	10/17/07	Chad is a great teacher, Midway i was going to drop the class, he was able to teach what i should have learned in the previous Discrete Math class and this class, in time for the final. He made review sessions when everyone had time to attend and was available to talk before class (When he wasn't getting his monthly haircut)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paula Grcevic	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	1633666	12/5/12	Paula is an excellent professor. She always make sure EVERY students understand their assignments. She even gave some students few chances to improved their grades. Some students complaining about their low grades so they blame Paula. It is wrong because they didn't do THEIR effort to show up the classes or give homework on time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paula Grcevic	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	1633666	10/31/11	She's very open-minded, likes to chat with students about almost anything before and after classes. Relies a LOT on IdeaTools, but everything on there is needed for anyone who might need extra help. Fantastic artist, enjoyed having her for the last three years!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paula Grcevic	3.5	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	1633666	10/25/12	She was not helpful to me at all and she does not clarity anything. Her ideatools website is very confusing and her relying on it all the time actually caused my failure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Greene	2.8	2	Engineering	436	2	4	4	3	1373865	8/16/10	I do not necessarily like this guy as a professor but I have to say if you do what he tells you, you will get an A or B. One of the other raters said there is no partial credit. Have you EVER taken a non-multiple choice test where there wasn't partial credit? This guy is NOT going to reinvent education people so of course there is partial cr
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Greene	2.8	0	Engineering	617	1	2	1	4	1373865	11/30/09	Dr. Greene is very strict in what he wants to see on his exams. If your answer is not the exact same explaination as on his power point slides, it is wrong! No partial credit. during lecture he constantly walks up and down the aisle making sure everyone is awake. He only reads what is on the slides and then asks the class pointless questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Greene	2.8	1	Engineering		2	3	3	4	1373865	8/11/10	Not the most useful in class, but he pretty much lives in his office, and he's pretty helpful if you meet with him. He can be very condescending sometimes, but if you actually put forth effort, you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science	101	4	2	2	1	1618085	11/11/12	Talks in circles, will go on and on without reaching any sort of point.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science	101	4	1	1	4	1618085	9/24/12	Stay away from this instructor. He rambles, is not well prepared, is not very engaging with students. Low class attendance, with students just showing up for the exams. There has to be better teachers for SOC 101
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science		3	2	2	2	1618085	11/10/11	Likes to talk in circles. For hours. He'll spend 30 minutes on one slide and go off on many different tangents that have nothing to do with the slide. I'm not kidding when I say half the class falls asleep. It's near impossible to stay awake, and he calls you out if he catches you with a phone or laptop. He does know what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science		1	2	1	4	1618085	11/9/11	If you keep up with him, then you will understand a method of his teachings..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science	210	4	1	1	3	1618085	10/26/11	He is a very boring teacher. Very hard to stay awake in class. He basically told us the first day that the reason he is teaching a college class is because he didn't do too well in all other education institutes (ex. High schools, Middle Schools).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science		2	1	1	2	1618085	10/30/12	Terrible class, terrible teacher. He does nothing but ramble, and I felt that I didn't learn a single thing in this class. About 5 students and I all withdrew at the same time. I personally recommend finding a different teacher to take this class with. This professor personally told our class "there is no other teacher like him" well thats true
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science	101	1	1	1	3	1618085	2/7/12	I strongly suggest not taking this class. He is incredibly vague and never reaches his point, just goes off on useless tangents all class. He makes it impossible to know what he is talking about or what he expects for the tests. No work until week 8 where he tries to catch up by giving you excessive pointless writing assignments. Find someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science		3	2	2	2	1618085	11/10/11	I can't say he doesn't know what he is talking about, he is experienced. However he doesn't know how to keep what he's saying concise and easy to understand. He often goes on tangents or rambles about minuscule details. He'll talk for a couple minutes about one thing and I already want to fall asleep or play on my phone. Meh try to get someone else
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science		4	2	2	1	1618085	10/27/11	Foundation of sociology. He is an average teacher. He knows what he is talking about just not how to say it in a concise message. He is not a rude or unkind teacher just a very inexperienced one. Very easy to fall asleep in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brett Goldstein	1.5	0	Social Science	210	5	1	2	1	1618085	9/13/11	Knows what he's talking about, but not how to actually convey it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		5	4	4	5	90577	11/6/11	Even if you should disagree with black and white stance on such subjects as good and evil, he knows his stuff. That is he knows the fundamentals of writing. Learn to walk with him and you'll learn later to run past him later. Don't become discouraged he tears you down so you can build yourself back up. Sometimes medicine is hard to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English	200	2	2	5	3	90577	4/8/10	At first I thought he was brillant and definetly able to learn from. His thought process' were great to hear as well. But he has a rather unethical side when it comes to his students. I would recommend not getting to close with him. He also seems to become passive aggresive if he does not get the answer that he wants.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		3	5	4	5	90577	9/2/05	the best liberal arts class i took at rit. granted i dropped the class on the last day of classes because i slept through the final, but hey, at least he let me drop it on the last day rather than fail me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		4	4	5	3	90577	4/16/05	He has an inmense knowledge. This guy's a logical machine. Every time you hear the word "therefore" in class you'll say: "wow. I get it" He's also one of the funniest guys ever. His assignments are hard, but he rewards hard work generously. He hates pittyful excuses and understands your conce
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	0	English		1	1	1	NULL	90577	7/23/04	He is pretty funny for a teacher. But he can be a pain most of the time with his ridiculous assignments. He assigned a 10 pg research paper over winter break and I just stopped attending his class after that point. I don't recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		3	4	3	NULL	90577	2/28/03	Seems very overwhelming and mean at first, but after you get to know him, he's a cool guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		3	4	5	NULL	90577	12/20/02	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		2	4	4	4	90577	8/23/11	Teacher had a very defined style writing. Basically do what he says, and you'll get the grade you want. Very comical and fun -- was very flexible in helping us learn our own writing style. Was not easy, but not too hard either. Had a blast, will recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English	504	2	4	5	3	90577	1/27/08	I have taken him twice, both courses I did well in (A,B). He is tough but not hard to pass. As long as you go to class you will be fine. He is actually pretty fun even though he is tough. Easy grade overall and pretty interesting as well. First course I didn't buy the book and the second class I did. It just depends
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		1	4	3	1	90577	8/30/05	Though I did not agree with is politics at all, he is a great english professor, if you get him u will learn, no matter how dumb you are.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		5	3	4	1	90577	3/8/05	he's incredibly funny, got an A in his course! I would suggest that you have perfect attendance and keep on his good side then you'd have no trouble w/ him..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		1	5	5	NULL	90577	3/5/04	Don't F with VFA Golphin! He's a great and intelligent man but don't get on his bad side. He's also funnier than most comedians and has cool views on movies and stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		2	4	4	NULL	90577	2/23/03	Wicked Cool guy, though he made it nearly impossible to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Golphin	3.9	2	English		3	4	4	NULL	90577	12/2/02	One of the funniest teachers I've ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francia Gonzalez	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	3	1715518	6/11/12	I took Gonzalez for beginning Spanish 1 and she was absolutely amazing! There are nightly online homeworks but they take less than 30 minutes. Tests are fair but she is a very easy grader and will look to give you extra points. Overall extremely friendly and outgoing and she has a great sense of humor too! I highly recommend her. Easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	358687	2/27/13	The worst professor at RIT. He does not grade. Does not respond to Emails. Does not have stable office hours. There is no way to catch up or follow him in class. I got a C for the first time at RIT because of his method of teaching : ( The good part is that he is funny and has a great personalty as a human being : )
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	4	358687	11/17/12	Excellent professor! One of my favorites so far. Explains all the concepts crystal clear and will gladly sit down to help you if you don't understand something. Awesome sense of humor too and very much approachable! Easily, one of the best math professors at RIT :]
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	1	358687	4/17/12	He's the man. No tests, just collects some work in folder you turn in, can easily copy, and get an A. Just be sure you get him for the next in sequence or your screwed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	358687	3/12/12	Excellent math teacher. In fact, best math teacher I ever had. Even though that I suck at Math, with his help and support a got a B. He takes his time to explain whatever needs to be explained, he never rushs when the class doesn't understand something. Very funny and nice guy, always smiling and takes everything easy. ( GO AHEAD WITH HIM!)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	358687	12/1/11	He treats the study portfolio like it's the most necessary component of the class. More of the students time is spent perfecting past material in the portfolio than learning and understanding new material. He is very helpful and approachable, but he believes his portfolio is the best and only way to teach, which, it is not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	271	3	5	4	5	358687	11/26/11	Favorite calc prof. Fun to have and doesn't require a textbook so money saved, BUT WARNING, even though a textbook isn't required for purchase, he makes you create your own textbook through organized notes that he checks for points. It is very helpful but WILL take numerous hours to complete ESPECIALLY if you fall behind at the end of the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	358687	10/30/11	The best. Knows how to teach. Never gave up on me, even when i was struggling.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	2	358687	4/6/11	TAKE HIS CLASS. One of the best teachers I have ever had. I hate math and enjoyed class, even doing well in it. You'll use the text book he wrote, but he gives you a copy of what you need for homework. He helps you a ton and while some problems are more difficult, it is totally worth it. You HAVE TO WORK, but core questions will seem SUPER EASY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	2	358687	1/26/11	Mr Goodwill is the man. That's all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	304	3	5	5	3	358687	10/29/10	Differential Equations: Best Math Professor EVER; Not exactly easy, but he sure can teach and make things clear, which is the most important thing to look for. Teachers this good are rare at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	0	Mathematics		2	3	1	3	358687	11/27/12	Confusing lectures, often allowed students to work at board so rest of class copies an incorrect example. Grading is pretty arbitrary so suck up and go to his office hours. He is fun to have in class though very laid back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	101	4	4	5	4	358687	9/20/12	Wonderful sense of humor. great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	358687	4/2/12	Best Professor ever! He really understands what he teaches and will find a way to help you understand, all you have to do is ask. I went from a D with a bad professor to an A with Goodwill. My only regret is that I couldn't take him this quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	101	4	5	5	3	358687	1/30/12	Great professor tons of fun to have and his classes are always fun, can grade tough but always makes it possible to help a bad grade. he let my class replace our lowest 2 test grades with the final, we only took to tests too. i still visit his class just to hang out with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	358687	12/1/11	He can definitely make your week extremely stressful, but he's a great teacher and loves teaching. Doesn't use a textbook but guides you through building a portfolio of organized notes which is tedious but makes for great study material. Fun to listen to, appreciates hard work and honesty.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	358687	11/20/11	Tim is an interesting character. He cannot decide how he wants to teach his course, but on whatever method he attempts he will put his heart into it. You can always approach Tim with problems, both personal and in math. He's a great caring guy. He can make your week REALLY stressful, but it will pay off in the end. Does a decent job overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	358687	8/18/11	Always helpful and loves teaching! Great professor, actually made me miss calculus when I was done. I would highly recommend! He wants you to try your best and do well in his class, something that is hard to find in professors now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	5	358687	2/1/11	Great calc teacher!!! Would never want a different professor for this cl03ass. Workshops are easy and tests and quizzes are not hard if you look over note sheets. Definitely Recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	1	Mathematics		5	1	5	5	358687	12/3/10	Awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	358687	10/20/10	Fantastic instructor, taught me more than any other math instructor ever has, highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	271	2	2	5	4	358687	9/22/10	Great great teacher. He takes a different approach to teaching calc that really is intriguing for the students. and btw... NEVER PULL OUT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	4	358687	3/13/10	Study hard for his tests which can be quite difficult. Grades on a curve most times. Funny guy, I just didn't like him for some reason. Had to really earn my A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	358687	12/4/09	Goodwill is the best professor that I have had thus far at RIT. If he is teaching any math course, then sign up with him. He is so helpful, especially during his office hours. Trust me, he is fantastic. You will not regret signing up with him. Greatest guy ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	358687	7/22/09	GREAT TEACHER! It had been almost a year since I'd taken the pre-req to his class but he explained everything so well that it was no problem at all. Very helpful outside of class, and very understanding if you have to miss a class for something important. He really wants you to succeed, and his optional homeworks let you know what is on the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	2	358687	4/26/09	He is a nice guy, but is very hard grader. His test are not what you expect them to be. He says he will be available, but always gives reasons why he was not there. He was sick a lot of the time, so stay away during the winter quarter. If you like math and you like a challenge take him. If you need to take this course dont take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	358687	4/21/09	Calculus sucks...but Tim was a great teacher and a really fun and nice guy. One of my favorite professors here at RIT and definitley my favorite math teacher ever. If you wanna learn something and have fun definitley take a class from him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	358687	2/2/09	Awesome teacher! Best math professor I have ever had. He gives a lot of extra credit, and if you do the extra work you will really know your stuff. He hangs out in the library and loves helping students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	358687	9/5/08	Very nice, very good at teaching, is VERY willing to explain stuff at office hours, but he assigns enough homework to make you suicidal..and to further it, he makes them up, not the book, so sometimes they're hard as heck. I've finished way too many beers while pulling all nighters of 10 hours of homework straight for his class - but great teach..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	2	358687	7/9/08	Very good professor. Tells math stories and is very funny. Pretty hard material but he made it both interesting and fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	358687	6/3/08	Good teacher, very helpful at office hours, very clear. This was his first time teaching Calc C this semester (20073) and he assigned A LOT of homework and it was VERY hard and it was graded VERY badly (by a TA), that combined with the fact that it was worth 90% of the final (160% of a test) made it barely bearable. Other than the h/w he's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	4	358687	5/21/10	Both Tim and the TA did not help me when I had questions, they would get me halfway through then give up. I had class during his office hours and he would not accommodate. Homeworks would take 3+ hours, since he uses his own book. Lectures did not teach skills needed on tests, workshops or homeworks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	358687	2/22/10	very hard, dont take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	272	5	5	5	5	358687	10/28/09	Goodwill is the man! Trust Me
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	358687	7/21/09	Best math teacher i have ever had, and that is saying a lot. Very easy to work with and is always available, he makes class hard but if you put in the effort you will learn and remember a lot. Real funny guy always makes class interesting even at 8am, I always look for his name for math classes. A++++will buy from again, fast shipper
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	4	358687	4/21/09	I love this guy. He broke the class down into the parts we needed to understand and made sure we knew it. His work is challenging, but you'll know it by the time he's done. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	3	358687	3/2/09	He was a nice teacher, but very hard grader. His test are extremely hard, and the final was very difficult. If you get the correct answer for a test, you might not get full credit because its not the work he wanted to see. If you want a teacher with a personality take him, but he will be hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	358687	10/14/08	Awesome guy, brings a lot of good humor to the class. Tests are very fair, and he gives LOTS of extra credit. However, the homework will destroy you, and it is graded on correctness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	358687	8/19/08	Project based calc 3, he doesn't teach it often, but he is good at it. Very generous with corrections, and great at presenting the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	1	358687	6/18/08	Funny guy who always kept class interesting and lively. Goes at a pretty fast pace but always willing to slow down and explain if you get lost. Hard tests and almost impossible HWs, but plenty of opportunities to get extra credit and boost your grade. Relies heavily on mycourses and is always on there to answer student ?'s immediately.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	225	3	5	5	5	358687	5/13/08	Amazing teacher, with a lot of patiences and understandings with the students' needs. Homework and tests submit online but a good opportunity to get help from him. Good class and good teacher, recommend you to take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	358687	5/1/08	Best teacher I've ever had at RIT. He writes all the notes on his computer so you can get then if you miss a class. Goes over everything thoroughly, and is always willing to help. He came to every class, even when he had problems with his back. No textbook because he writes all his own homework. Made a lot of jokes and kept class interesting. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	358687	12/27/07	Awesome Professor. I took my entire Calc sequence and he has an uncanny ability to make math fun. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	1	358687	11/8/07	I hate him when i first took his class because he requires you to submit your hws online. Therefore, you ll have to scan like 15 pages of integrals which takes forever. Later on, I found out that he's a great professor, his lectures are good and it was easy to understand whats going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	358687	5/16/07	He's the hottest hotness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		1	5	5	5	358687	2/7/07	I took Goodwill for both calc 1 and 2, and has been my faviorate teacher. willing to put in the time to help you and go out of his way to help you pass. lots of work but you really know your stuff when you are done. great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	358687	1/5/07	Good professor, I hated college math, but his course I did fairly well in. I found it to be a lot more fun than most of the other courses i had taken. I reccommend taking him if you get the opportunity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	358687	2/28/06	Cool guy, easy going, difficult class but he is helpful and clear. Good lecture and notes. Curves a lot to help out! Def recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	1	358687	12/25/05	absolutely THE best math professor i have EVER had. Amazing, makes sure you understand, goes out of the way to help and presents it in a way that is easy to understand (uses his computer so the notes can easily be posted online)his online hw pertains to the stuff done in class the book work can get annoying you actually WANT to go to his class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	3	358687	10/10/05	Eh, he's ok I guess.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	358687	3/8/05	Pretty cool professor. He explains things very well, and takes time to make sure you learn. Likes to tell stories, but the lighten the mood and make it seem like less of a class. Which is cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	101	4	5	5	2	358687	3/12/08	Awesome teacher, had him for algebra (made extremely easy) and surprisingly a fencing class. Fun in and out of class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	358687	11/16/07	Really good teacher. Easy to understand and learn from. I'm really bad at math and I actually liked this course. The professor definitely made what I would say is a bad course good. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	225	4	5	5	4	358687	10/24/07	Goodwill's cool. The way he teaches is very easy to understand. He makes up his own homework and his own tests and makes it very easy to get a good grade in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics	232	3	5	4	4	358687	2/28/07	Great teacher to have, always helpful. Homework is hard but it prepares you for exams. Nice guy overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	358687	2/3/07	Gr8 professor, gr person. Teaches excellent, explains clearly each and every concept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	358687	3/18/06	Superb! I love Tim goodwill's teaching style, hes extreamly informative and you will actually learn tons from this course; instead of just memorizing theory. he makes math fun by throwing in stories about his life and math history (belive it or not). going to his class is a pleasure and it is easy if u study. he never fails to let students down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	358687	1/6/06	awesome teacher. takes time to answer questions, and actually cares when his students dont understand something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	1	358687	12/15/05	Absolutely awesome teacher. I took Calc I previous and I hated Calc before his class. Never got above a C with my last professor. I ended up with an A based on the way he teaches. I wish I could have him for Calc II, and want him for Dif. Eq.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	1	358687	3/30/05	tims the man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	1	358687	1/19/05	Wants everybody to understand what he's talking about but understands that a lot of people don't like math. Is a little hard to get a hold of for extra help, has a tendency to not show up once you have arranged to go see him. Over all, a good guy who tries hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	358687	10/24/04	Goodwill is awesome. He teaches very well, and makes a very rare occurence happen; making a Calc. class fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	NULL	358687	5/8/04	Definately the best math teacher I have had. Very knowledgeful, always willing to help, shows you where everything comes from, wish i could take him again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	NULL	358687	3/7/04	Very helpful professor :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	358687	7/23/04	One of the best math teachers RIT has to offer. I recommend him a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	NULL	358687	3/31/04	Had Goodwill for calculus 1,2 and Differential equations...great guy, teaches well, keeps the class focused and on point. Always willing to slow down and help you. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Goodwill	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	358687	2/26/04	Good teacher, great grading system, cares more about process then right answer, always willing to help you. Highly recommended, but not during night course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology		2	5	5	4	917564	1/8/09	Dr. Gopal is a very engaging and knowledgeable professor. Her teaching style is very relaxed and she makes use of her own knowledge alongside the textbooks effectively. She has frequent office hours and does not hesitate to schedule an appointment outside of those times to help her students. Overall an amazing professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology	493	3	5	5	5	917564	11/25/08	I've taken a number of bioinformatics classes with Dr. Gopal while at RIT. I've also had the pleasure of participating in research under her guidance at RIT. She is a kind teacher with a great attitude and I can say I consider her as much a friend as a mentor. This may make my opinion bias, but it's tough to call a poor professor a friend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology	311	2	3	4	3	917564	8/22/07	Okay teacher. Kind of a tough class for me, but if you read and study you should do fine. The recitation part of it really boosts your grade so avg was a high B in my class. (allows you to do kinda poorly on your tests and still do well overall) Had an attitude problem and treats her students like they are in elementary school at times.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology	762	2	5	5	5	917564	11/25/08	One of the best professors I have had. In the many classes I have taken from her she has continuously demonstrated not only exemplary knowledge of bioinformatics but clarity and efficiency in teaching. Breaking complex topics into easily understood lectures. She is always glad to help a student that shows interest and attends her lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology	762	2	5	5	4	917564	11/24/08	Great professor.Extremely well planned classes.Concepts explained in great depth and clarity.Interesting course material. Challenging exams. A must take course for a Bioinformatics student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	1	Biology		3	3	3	2	917564	6/19/07	Good Professor but bad advisor. She got attitude problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shuba Gopal	4.5	2	Biology		3	4	5	3	917564	11/14/06	She is a brilliant teacher! She is intelligent, friendly, witty, and easy to understand and learn from. She really knows the material. Even though she is a bioinformaticist, she seems to have an EXCELLENT understanding of cell biology. Also, she designed a really interesting recitation to go along with the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Gorthy	3.3	1	Criminal Justice		4	3	3	3	9108	10/2/05	Could have been more organized. Exams won't too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Gorthy	3.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	NULL	9108	2/19/03	good class, a lot of notes, but tests aren't too difficult.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology	350	3	1	2	5	919657	5/9/09	This class should be a basic level one designed to bring everyone to the same level in the understanding of internal computer components. However, Gover makes this class seem like the most important one in the world. Just because she teaches it, she thinks that nobody other than her knows anything else about the class. Take George Barrido's class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology	350	3	1	3	2	919657	10/6/08	Save yourself the grief and choose another professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology	350	1	1	1	5	919657	5/1/08	Computer System Fundamentals is a basic class with grade school work. Any idiot should be able to read off the supplied power points, and demonstrate the basic hard drive to motherboard connections; however Gover seems to mess this up some how with politics. Correcting her in class was not something I should have done, as it resulted in a B. :-(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	3	919657	10/18/07	Took her for Comp Sys Funds. Really nice and funny teacher who has lots of interesting stories to make the class not boring. I didn't think she was a very difficult teacher if you did the work and participated in class. I would take classes with her again in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	1	Information Technology		4	2	4	3	919657	9/6/07	Doesnt explain anything, didnt even know that we had a assignment due the next day because she didnt even tell us that we had one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	1	Information Technology	341	3	4	2	5	919657	12/2/06	Computer Platform Fundamentals She was very organized, with a lecture prepared every day. If you don't take notes or read the textbook on your own, there's pretty much nothing to help you. The tests are not that hard with some studying. There were, in total, 3 homeworks and 2 papers. Wasn't much work to be done outside of class. Good prof. overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology		3	1	2	5	919657	5/9/09	Avoid at all costs. Please take my word on this. She has class favorites, is not helpful, very unfair grading, and will not listen to you if you are trying to tell her that she is mistaken. In fact, if you correct her in class or say something she does not agree with, she will try to take as many points off as possible from every assignment + tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	2	Information Technology	350	4	4	4	2	919657	5/5/08	Great Professor who uses real world examples and makes class interesting. I had little to no knowledge of hardware prior to this class and learned a lot of new things in this class. If you do all the work it's an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	5	5	919657	11/8/07	Very clear in her presentation and keeps things interesting. Never felt like falling asleep during her lectures. She gives a lot of answers for free and will also help point you in the right direction if you get lost on anything. She grades generously too. If you pay attention and attend, it is an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	2	Information Technology	350	4	5	4	3	919657	10/1/07	Professor provides ease of contact (email, IM, phone). Goes over work and gives some of the answers. As long as you take notes and pay attention, it is an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology	342	3	1	1	3	919657	1/29/07	I had her for 342 networking lab. She doesn't offer any help. She tells you to look in the (outdated) manual. The network diagrams in our manual were outdated so when we made connections that should work, they didn't. She wouldn't help explain the network setup. My partner and I spent hours on a lab because of this. We finally had to ask a labby.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Gover	2.8	0	Information Technology	341	2	2	1	5	919657	11/16/06	She is really nerdy, talkative. Grades unfair(except probably to the kids who talk the most in class, don't take me up on this, its just what I think), Lab manual is outdated, or just not well organized. You actually have to take notes if you want to get a A cause she doesn't post much content to help you out. Unclear about what she wants.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	0	Writing	319	3	1	2	4	735132	3/13/11	i originally was very excited to take Terrorism in Fiction and Film it quickly became a dreaded class the books were practically archaic and sucked u read six books in ten weeks so u have to rush plus he expects u to remember tiny ass details that are COMPLETELY irrelevant to the over all story he goes off on tangents he simply should retire
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	1	Writing	101	4	2	3	1	735132	4/21/07	Harvey is one of a kind. Do your work and you'll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	0	Writing		3	2	2	1	735132	11/29/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	0	Writing		2	1	2	1	735132	1/27/11	Granite is extremely boring and puts people to sleep every class. I took him for Terrorism in Film and Fiction and the books are hard to understand but the films are sort of interesting. The only homework is to read the books besides the essays so there isn't much homework to worry about but is pretty strict about the essays
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	2	Writing	227	4	4	5	3	735132	3/22/07	I thought he was good, although I know how to write and take some pride in it. If you cannot write or aren't willing to put any effort in it, I don't recommend Granite, because he grades accordingly. As a professor he consistently brought up new and interesting topics in class and also included movies in the curriculum.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Granite	2.3	0	Writing		3	2	2	4	735132	10/24/05	it could have been a good class, yet somehow writing about the same topic for 4 straight essays is not fun at all. he makes no sense, and often loses track of what he's saying. your writing just will not improve. don't take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	0	Criminal Justice		1	2	2	4	346593	2/20/13	If criminal justice isn't your major, DROP IMMEDIATELY. This took precious time away from my real classes when it was supposed to be an interesting sub topic to fill my free elective requirements. She really expects every student to have bright hopes for a future in law. If this is your jam, go for it. If not, prepare for way too many stupid papers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	507	4	5	4	5	346593	5/17/12	She's a little bit of a spas at times, but the class is interesting and she isn't particularly demanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	346593	8/21/11	Had Professor Gravitz for Computer Crime. Great class, you'll learn so much, slow to post in class readings and grade. No midterm or final, all work is done out of class and its a good amount. Highly recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	346593	11/22/10	Awesome teacher, makes learning about Computer Crime fun. Willing to help you learn. Do not procrastinate on briefs, go to class (Pop Quizzes, Attendance, "Participation" are 10%) and you will get an A.Taking her again next quarter for another CJ class because I had such a good experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	4	5	346593	8/23/09	She's very helpful, nice, funny. Classes are taught based on the level of the students in them. Legal Writing prepared me for Law school. Cyberlaw was really interesting. She's almost impossible to track down sometimes though. NOT an email person, which is odd for a tech school prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	4	2	346593	1/28/08	Had her for many different classes and she is a great teacher and really easy! you want her as a professor will help you in any way. Highly recommend, she is really friendly and is a great great teacher! I try to take her every quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	5	4	346593	2/20/06	She signs, awesome!! Makes it so much easier to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	4	3	346593	3/4/05	Kows how to make the class very interesting however does have some flaws (not an email person and others). Exam was a bit tough but does fair grading and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	NULL	346593	4/1/04	She's great!!! She even signs during class! Gotta love her!!!! :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	0	Criminal Justice		1	2	2	4	346593	2/20/13	AWFUL EXPERIENCE! I have no idea who these people are who took CPU Crime with her and liked it but she grades incredibly hard. She hands out zeroes so that you have "incentive" to rewrite extremely time-consuming knowledge. Likes to knit pick papers down to C's and make terrible jokes. ASSIGNED A 5 PAGE PAPER WEEK 11 AFTER THE FINAL PAPER! RUN!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	4	346593	3/12/12	Prof. Gravitz is humorous and an outstanding communicator. She grades TOUGH - I consider myself an excellent writer yet struggled to reach the depth of analysis she wanted. Still learned a ton from her class and somehow pulled off an A. If you're Deaf, she is a native signer despite not being hard of hearing or deaf, and signs all classes herself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	346593	2/14/11	Awesome professor. Had no prior knowledge of the subject material, and made it very easy to follow. WARNING: takes a long time to grade papers, so if you're looking for immediate feedback, go in to office hours to have her personally look over stuff before hand!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	1	Criminal Justice		2	3	3	2	346593	10/19/09	She's a friendly teacher, but demands an insane amount of work. She takes the "2 hours in class, 4 hours of work out of class" very seriously. Being a 4th year and it being a freshman course makes it surprising when she has assignments that are more work than I've ever seen. Tough grader, no tests, but holds your hand too much which gets annoying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	501	4	5	5	5	346593	3/4/08	Excellent professor. Explains things very throroughly loves to have student input. a get you thinking kind of teacher, always willing to help you overcome obstacles. Likes to read our papers, fair on grading, hard to get her to email you back, but she will eventually. Highly recommend you take classes from her, she has alot of info to teach!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	444	4	5	5	3	346593	3/2/07	Prof Gravitz is the equivalent to your favorite teacher in high school - she make her lectures very clearly and is very entertaining. It's different from many classes I've taken, and it's just so refreshing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	4	346593	10/2/05	Wonderful... I had an easy time with her, not everyone does. She is more than willing to help you fix anything that is wrong though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Gravitz	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	NULL	346593	5/27/04	Great prof.. very helpful... would take for another class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	759017	7/29/12	Professor Grebinger is a great professor and very nice guy. I took his class cultures of Globalization. it was very interesting class. If you take his class, make sure to read the chapters and other material he assigns. If you struggle, he is very helpful.I got an A from that class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology		4	4	4	1	759017	2/28/12	really kind guy, but if you take his class, READ EVERYTHING. i made the mistake of thinking i would remember everything from the lectures and movies. take notes, and read. his midterm and final were questions based of all the readings for the course. (cultures in globalization)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology	510	5	5	5	4	759017	2/2/11	Absolutely amazing. Sweetest man ever. Very helpful and understanding. Discussing based class. Knowledgeable in many areas, takes great interest in students and students opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	4	759017	5/3/07	I took his sustainable development class last quarter. He is helpful, insightful, and interesting. He did a wonderful job of presenting such a complicated, frightening, and controversial subject (the changes occurring in our world today). Go to class, participate, READ the material, and put thought into the essays. You'll be fine and learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology		3	3	5	5	759017	11/1/06	He is a really nice guy. Do the readings and put a little effort in the essays and youll get an A or B no problem. He is obsessed with Colombia and this anthropolgy guy. Its kind of creepy. We saw this one video with his "mentor" in it. And they both looked eerily similar.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	1	Anthropology		3	3	3	4	759017	5/18/12	Had him for Cultures of Globalization. He gives out three grades, one being a writing assignment and the other two being tests. Made the mistake of not reading the assigned chapters in the textbook, and suffered on the test. Okay teacher with a lot of real world experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology	440	3	5	5	5	759017	6/2/11	I loved this professor! He explained things very well during lectures. Reading assignments (for hw) and documentaries in class were very helpful. A great guy, too! He wants his students to do well and get something out of the class. Class I had: Cultures in Globalization
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	2	Anthropology		3	4	4	3	759017	5/14/07	Show up, take notes, read the material and you'll be all set. He could certainly stand to pick up the pace when he lectures, but he's helpful, fair, and a nice guy. Seems very knowledgeable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	1	Anthropology		4	3	2	4	759017	2/27/07	He's not a very good lecturer and is kind of boring. If you study the books, come to class to watch the movies, and read the readings then it's not hard. He's very nice and gives chsnces. If you are not a lecture person and prefer to read the book then he's probably the right teacher for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Grebinger	3.9	0	Anthropology		4	1	1	1	759017	2/7/06	Brings his politics to the forefront of the class, and if you disagree, your grade will probably suffer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Greenholz	1.8	0	Environmental Science		1	2	2	3	1448555	8/29/11	Online version of course is as others described. VERY demanding, quite time consuming, but does contain a lot of good information. The discussion questions are forced and the timed quizzes require detailed recollection and thorough comprehension of the extensive assigned reading and cd lecture. I would not recommend to the non-traditional student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Greenholz	1.8	1	Environmental Science	301	2	3	2	1	1448555	2/1/11	Tough and a lot of work for 300 level course. Be PREPARED!!!! or your SOL for the rest of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deborah Greenholz	1.8	0	Environmental Science	301	1	1	1	3	1448555	4/3/11	This professor is one of the worst professors I have ever seen. It is absolutely ridiculous what she requires and talks down to everyone in the class. When you challenge her on the astronomical workload, she says "what just because this is an online class doesn't mean it should be easy. "She will belittle you in emails and be extremely disrespectfu
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	1416104	5/17/12	Chad works you hard, but not without reason. I have learned the most under his instruction, because he stresses the importance of sketches to come up with creative solutions. He is a tougher grader than other teachers, but not without purpose. He doesn't play into the grade inflation rampant in CIAS. His industry experience is invaluable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	5	1416104	11/17/11	Has an incredible background in the industry, but uses this business approach with his teaching methods - he expects you to stick to the sketch you showed him and there is little room for creativity. He was more than willing to help anyone out with any questions they had about digital programs. A very nice guy in general.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	1	Fine Arts		1	3	2	4	1416104	11/19/10	It's all business with this guy - no room for artistic expression. And don't you DARE stray even the slightest bit from your primary sketches or he will freak out...which makes no sense for an art course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		5	5	3	5	1416104	5/16/10	I've heard mixed reviews about Chad. Basically if he likes you, you will get As, and if he does not you will get Bs. I personally get along very well with Chad, and he is my favorite Illustration professor here. You'll learn a lot about the industry in all of his classes. Take Digital and Sketchbook with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	3	1416104	3/9/10	Chad is a great teacher for any subject, but digital is his forte. Whether you're completing vector art or painting in photoshop, Chad is a fountain of knowledge. The best part is, not only is he incredibly skilled, but he's very passionate about trying to instill quality in his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	1416104	5/8/12	Chad is an awesome professor. He's a tough grader but everything he says in class in general and about your work is completely relevant and worth taking note of. He goes quickly in his demos but will take as much time as you need if you ask questions. I would definitely recommend taking a class with Chad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	1	Fine Arts		1	3	2	4	1416104	11/22/10	Awesome industry experience, BUT, seems he DOES grade based on personal likes. Too harsh a grader; I've never had grades as low as his through 3 yrs of college. Spent WAY more time on his class projects than any other. Made us do 25-50 sketches for each proj - too time consuming. Wouldnt take him again based on workload and extremely tough grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	1416104	5/20/10	This is a wonderful course. It's one of those I'm very worried will disappear in the semester switch, or be merged into something else, but that should be saved at all costs. The assignments were challenging and interesting, the class atmosphere relaxed and encouraging, everything about this class is everything an illustration class should be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chad Grohman	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	1416104	4/28/10	Chad is a great teacher. Not only does he provide a good variety of assignment topics, but is very supportive of students fitting the topics into themes or styles they're interested. Worth taking for any class, but it's Digital Mixed Media he's most passionate about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Gulack	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	727867	11/29/05	As long as you show up you should get an A

Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	1	67403	4/29/09	Doesn't explain things well, LOTS of Homework(5+ pages more than once). When asked to explain a homework question, he will only do a similar one, not the same one. Very boring class, expects you teach a lot to yourself. Homework and Attendance counts.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	0	Mathematics	226	2	2	1	1	67403	10/25/07	Takes a week or more to return hw, not very timely if you don't know what's going on. Tests are too long for the time given. Rushes through material. Our class average was about a 69.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	2	67403	6/16/07	He certainly knows his material, but his method of presenting it is a little off. He thinks that just because he gets it, everyone else will. As a general rule, Discrete 2 isn't easy, but taking it with Gupta will easily raise the difficulty by a factor of 5.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	2	67403	1/12/07	Discrete math II with him is not a good idea. Gupta takes off lots of points for stupid reasons. He is a bit overzealous when it comes to proofs. Not the best teacher in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	4	67403	10/18/05	brilliant teacher, would take again and again short guy with tons of knowledge, pretty much sums him up
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	4	67403	5/1/05	Good teacher. Knows the material well and passes it on well. Not much help in office hours, but he has plenty of them so w/e. Easy tests, easy homework. Fun man with a peculiar sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	NULL	67403	8/28/03	Cool professor with quizes every Friday...not always easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	NULL	67403	10/21/02	not a bad teacher always asks if anyone has questions n crap
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		4	2	3	2	67403	1/19/09	Honestly, he's not a terrible teacher, and I did learn a lot from him. The only bad thing I have to say is that he assigns way to much HW. If you have Gupta plan on spending between 5 and 15 hours a week on HW. He also tends to cut off students but other than that he's a nice guy and is willing to help you learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	2	67403	11/19/07	Pros: Nice Teacher, Curves Exams, borderline grade means he probably will round up. Drops one test, but final is worth more. Cons: Grades a small fraction of homework problems, many of these problems are hard (if you get them wrong you lose points). The final can be worth up to 60% of your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67403	10/11/07	All he does is do problems in class out of the book and doesn't explain how to do them...sometimes he starts a prob and then says oh you can figure out the rest. Then he gives you about 50 math problems a week to do and only grades 10. Nice guy but not a very good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	67403	3/1/07	i haaated gupta. his lectures were hell. he's not a hard teacher, but dont expect his class to be easy. i DEFINITELY DONT RECOMMEND GUPTA. his class was the worst i've had at rit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	3	67403	11/28/06	I don't know how he teaches discrete math I, but discrete math II with him is not a good idea. I got an A in disc I easy, but when I got to Gupta's class I thought it was the easiest class I ever took, until he started taking off lots of points for stupid reasons and his ridiculous definition questions. Feels even if it's right, it's wrong to him

Rochester Institute of Technology	Laxmi Gupta	2.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	67403	3/2/05	Gupta is the man. His classes are laid back and his tests are pretty easy. You feel real calm about going to his class and absorbing this buddha-like figure's knowledge.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Miguel Gutierrez	3.0	1	Information Technology	539	4	4	2	4	1696883	2/28/12	Had for Server Side Programming. He's been in industry for a while and is still getting used to academia. His methods are pretty disorganized, but if you try to meet him half way you'll do alright.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	2	Information Technology	113	3	5	5	5	575163	11/15/10	GREAT TEACHER!!! Best teacher i have ever had.. All the crap about him not being good is lies or disrespect to their teachers! He is amazing and the most helpful teacher i have ever had!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	2	Information Technology		5	3	4	2	575163	10/31/05	Not my o teacher at all. Don't take him if you know anything about HTML beforehand...the class goes by very slowly, and you don't walk away feeling like you learned anything significant. HOWEVER, I'd highly recommend him if you are absolutely need a slower paced class to learn HTML and haven't had any experience before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	2	Information Technology	409	4	5	5	4	575163	7/14/05	He's a real great progessor. I highly reccomend him. I had him for Intro to Multimedia and Interactive Degital Media and in both classes he was very interesed in if the students were understanding it and he goes over things multiple times so you will get it. And you get to make some pretty cool webpages.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	5	575163	7/6/09	very political, not teaching properly, intentionally make things difficult or have a no teaching skill. only cares for his teaching evaluation, but not teaching itself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	5	575163	10/27/06	I had already knew html and flash beforehand so didn't learn much so I just did my own thing in class and didn't pay attention. He is an excellent teacher to have if you have no html or flash experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	1	Information Technology		5	1	4	4	575163	10/17/05	Yeah, he's an easy teacher, but if you know even a basic amount of HTML this class is useless. Most of the time he teaches you how to create animated gifs and rollover buttons using Fireworks while other classes are well into learning CSS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Habermas	3.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	575163	3/1/05	He is the greatest. He is very available outside of the classroom, and actually cares about you learning. Take this class. I got an "a." If You do your work and pay attention, you really dont have to study. He lets you go online while you take tests and use what you find to answer the questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Haggerty	5.0	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	1237121	12/30/08	The first time I saw him, he all of a sudden put us into the thinking zone. Which means we have to figure out what we need to adjust our essay and how can we improve it to make it look professional. I recommend to take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	520	1	5	5	5	11308	7/26/12	Extremely organized for teaching this class for the first time ever. His classes are literal bootcamps, but believe me when I say completely worth it. I learned more in this class than I did in my collective six years as an undergraduate. Very personable and hilarious, too. You won't be disappointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	5	5	11308	9/13/11	I took him for Internet Marketing, and while it was one of the hardest class I took in college, it was by far the most rewarding. If you are looking for an easy grade Hair is not the teacher to take. If you put in the work you will learn more in this class than any other course you have taken. Hair is a smart guy and is very good at what he does.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	101	2	5	5	4	11308	10/18/10	I had Neil for Principles of Marketing. It was so much fun every class!! It was a 6-10 class but it didn't even seem like 4 hours because it just flew by. One of the greatest professors I have ever had. Take him if you EVER get the chance. No tests, just 2 papers and a project. The work is hard but it is worth it!! Real world experience as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		2	5	5	4	11308	2/8/10	Neil is awesome! He knows what he is talking about when it comes to Internet Marketing. His slides are possibly the greatest thing created! No books!! Lots of experience and working with a real client. Hard class but worth it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	5	3	11308	6/29/09	The best professor I had at RIT...bar none. What he taught in the classroom wasn't just for a letter grade, it helped out in life as a whole. He built confidence, character and inspired us to push ourselves to the max. His teachings are STILL relevant 2 years later. I hold him with high regard and am grateful for having taken his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	5	4	11308	1/6/09	Excellent professor - one of the best I had while at RIT. Class includes a LOT of work, but it's totally worth it and you'll leave his class having accomplished some very important business practices and strategies. Lectures are interesting and extremely well presented as well. I would recommend would of Neil's classes to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	2	5	11308	9/25/08	Bar none the best professor I've had the pleasure of taking -- twice. I, unfortunately, discovered him my last year of college, and was unable to enroll in more courses with him. His standards are high, he's tough, but he knows his stuff and you WILL leave the class with lethal weapons -- an ironclad grasp on marketing and the internet. RECOMMENDED

Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	5	4	11308	11/28/10	O. M. G. His assignments are a life time of work. Say goodbye to your social life. But his knowledge of internet marketing is amazing! If you can take his class and survive, do it! He makes you a cut above everyone else and gives you real world experience. He's awesome. Oh, and call him Uncle Neil, he loves that. :]
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	202	1	5	5	4	11308	5/20/10	Neil is Awesome! You will work very hard in his classes but it is all worth every minute. There is not text book or tests, just lots of classwork and group work. Do yourself a favor and go to every class and to his office hours. It helps a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		3	5	5	4	11308	6/29/09	Neil has been the best professor I have had in both undergrad and graduate school. His knowledge of marketing blew me away. I highly recommend all of the classes he teaches at RIT. The more opportunities you have, the better. Consultancy experience I gained from his courses got me my current job. I still seek advice from Neil today.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	440	2	5	5	5	11308	5/6/09	Hands down the best professor in the business school. This guy knows what he is talking about, and can really change your views on marketing. Relates everything in the course to how you can successful make money in the future. If you put the effort in it will be one of your most rewarding experiences at RIT. Highly recommended for all business stud
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	101	2	5	5	2	11308	1/5/09	Professor Neil Hair's teaching has had a major effect on my career. I had very little computer skills prior to taking his Internet Marketing Class. It was there I learned about HTML, Flash and how to develop effective web pages. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be doing what I do today. I am working for a Fortune 500 company using those same skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	300	2	5	5	5	11308	7/2/08	Neil is a great professor and really knows his stuff when it comes to marketing. As a recent alum, I can say for certain he is one of the only teachers that gives you real world knowledge that you will use. His class is difficult but if you keep up with the work, it's completely manageable. Tough but fair when it comes to grading. A+ from me!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	0	Business		2	2	2	1	11308	2/6/07	Tough class. TONS of work. The final consultancy projects give you real world experience, downside is that if you are put into a group that stinks, considering the majority of your grade is based on the project, its hard to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	772	2	5	5	5	11308	9/27/06	great prof. tough, but everything becomes all worth it in the end. his "5 questions" can be applied to nearly every fecet of daily life. be ready to bleed and sweat, but the rewards are sweet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		3	5	5	5	11308	3/18/06	After taking 3 of his classes i must say, Neil is the best professor in the college of business and probally in the whole institution, his teaching style and method is interactive and he views him self as a facilator instead of an expert with all the answers. Take his class you will love it; you will have a ton of work and a ton of presentations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		2	5	5	5	11308	3/12/06	A ton of work, A ton of presentations, A ton of projects, but at the end of the day you have absoult satisfaction with what you have learnt and achived.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	5	4	11308	2/7/06	Neil Hair is an excellent professor, absolutely no complaints. His class is the most informative, smart lecture I've taken yet at RIT. Sit his class if you are taking marketing and he's available. There is, however, a very, very large amount of work. This might be a good 12-credit-quarter class (rather than 16), but it is worth every second.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		1	5	4	5	11308	10/23/05	neil hair will run your life for 10 weeks. lots of work, but he really knows his stuff and makes class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business	363	2	5	5	3	11308	1/26/05	This man's class is simply AMAZING. Highly underrated, and not a lot of people know who he is. He's British, but you get used to the accent very quickly. Plus you get to hear someone say "bloody!" in class. He is helpful, engaging, and more importantly makes you THINK in his class. Highly reccomend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		3	5	5	5	11308	3/6/06	Excellent Teacher and very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	1	Business		1	4	2	4	11308	2/3/06	Neil is an interesting professor, but the amount of work that he assigns is way too much to do, along with your other classes. I wouldn't mind taking him for a class, but only if he reduced the workload, because it was impossible to balance what he expected from me and my group, along with my other courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Neil Hair	4.6	2	Business		2	4	5	5	11308	9/15/05	This dude is very very british and very very intelligent - fricking awesome sense of humor, i mean if he makes fun of my inside-out clothes in class then he definitely is a sweet deal.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Halbstein	4.2	2	Imaging Science		3	5	4	5	1688644	5/20/12	A good guy and teacher but his one downfall is that he seems to be so busy with stuff outside of class that he loses touch with the students as the quarter goes on. In my opinion, its the only thing keeping him going from a good to a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Halbstein	4.2	2	Imaging Science		2	5	3	4	1688644	1/24/12	Excellent professor with a real passion for teaching. His fatal flaw however is that his lectures are extremely redundant with him repeating the same concepts, which can make his lectures dry and inconveniently long.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	206525	4/11/07	Myra won't give you a free ride, but she will definitely make you think/work. She really makes you work, and wants more than just what the project entails. a C is getting the job done. a B is going above the assignment, and an A is going above and beyond the assignment. Take a class with her, or youre missing out on the best RIT has to offer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	1	Fine Arts		3	3	3	5	206525	2/3/06	Myra...what can I say about Myra...she's been an excellent teacher so far, but sometimes she can headbutt with students over work. Has critiques and gives everybody a chance and feedback, but sometimes plays favorites/jokes around with those kids. Sometimes her assignments are confusing, but you have to really listen and pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	3	206525	9/2/05	Myra is ideabased, and not good at teaching the techinal aspects you need in photo1
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	206525	2/3/05	She's one of the best photo 1 teachers you can take. She's tough and likes to play devils advocate... but you learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	NULL	206525	2/2/04	She is very opinionated, and won't tolerate people who are mouthy or stand up for themselves. But if you are an overall good student and hard working, she is ok.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	5	206525	10/29/06	Scatterbrained, but in a good way. SHe's no Gunther (as in, not technical), but she does make you think about more abstract concepts like, why make a photo in the first place. She's definitely not for everyone, but if you need help, then ask for it! She is a very helpful professor and takes the time to get to know you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	206525	10/18/05	A great teachers that makes you bring your own ideas to projects to add a personal aspect, not just all the technical stuff. Makes you think on your own. really pushes you to do great work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	2	5	3	206525	6/19/05	shes hot HOT HOT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	206525	11/17/04	Amazing! One of the most honest, passionate p[rofs I have ever had!! Forces you to critique yourself and look deeper into issues
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myra Greene	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	NULL	206525	5/7/03	don't take her if you want feedback on your work or help with anything at all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	2	Engineering	123	5	5	5	5	1139756	1/26/11	I had her for basicaly a field trip class, but she is funny, good looking, and can relate to students. Def. reccomend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	0	Engineering	350	1	1	1	3	1139756	2/21/10	from industry, and it's obvious. in online classes she seems to rely too heavily on grad students in group projects to teach the undergrads in the same class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	2	Engineering	201	5	4	4	4	1139756	11/19/09	I had Environmental Health and Seminar with her-all field trips,very cool.Easy grader,just show up!Good connections too if you're looking for department information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	1139756	11/3/08	Had her for EH&S seminar, and for Principles of Environmental Management, Both were easy, intro classes, well taught, got an A in both, (the seminar is only 1 credit and all field trips, very cool!) her tests are fairly easy, material is all posted online, do the work, show up to class, get a good grade, simple as that
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1139756	5/12/10	I had her in EHS Management, and Industrial waste water as well as Waste Management. I believe she is one of the best teachers i had ever in my life. Also she is friendly and extremely helpful. One more thing she is not raciest since I am an international student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	0	Engineering	350	1	1	1	3	1139756	2/21/10	from industry, and it's obvious. in online classes she seems to rely too heavily on grad students in group projects to teach the undergrads in the same class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Greenwood	3.6	2	Engineering		5	5	4	5	1139756	3/9/09	Super easy in terms of grading. If you miss a quiz or homework online, just ask and she'll probably extend it for you. I just showed up to class and got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	1	67402	6/27/11	Hesucked when I had him in 1969. I can't believe RITis still abusing students with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	2	Mathematics	314	5	5	5	5	67402	12/2/08	I cannot express how GREAT this guy is! He is helpful, always explains himself, gives comprehensive quizzes, and doesn't look down on you if you have a dumb question. Don't listen to the bad comments. I guess some people are just afraid of working and learning!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	67402	12/3/07	"welcome to Dater Analysis" first sentence on the first day. haha this guy isn't the best teacher, lots of free points for just showing up to class. tests are ok if you can do the review sheet which mimics the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		4	2	1	1	67402	10/22/06	He is one of the worst professors in history. But, Data 1 is so easy it shouldn't matter. All you need to get an A is his online review tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	1	67402	3/13/06	He sucked, I dropped the course halfway through the first class. I couldn't take listening to him. He's crazy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67402	3/2/06	Gruber is the worst professor EVER. He is absolutely terrible. I have learned NOTHING from his class. The average test grades were in the 40's. He is rude, inappropriate, and doesn't know how to teach. He just stands at the board and mutters to himself. His grading is terrible and totally biased. Do not EVER take this professor!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		4	1	2	3	67402	9/27/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	67402	11/2/04	I Fully agree with what has been said. DO NOT TAKE this course with GRUBER! I have had a 4.0 gpa for 2 years... now I don't. Partially my fault, but mostly because I just can't deal with this guy. He's very intelligent yet a horrible teacher. Be prepared to stare at his back as he rambles... RUN!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67402	10/21/04	Bad.. Get out while you still can. This is probably a very intelligent man, too intelligent to be able to explain what he is doing. He just writes on the board and expects you to know what he's talking about. Tests are impossible.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	1	67402	2/8/11	Reasonable, but rambling.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics	314	1	1	1	3	67402	11/13/08	This is one of the worst professors I have ever had, he mumbles a lot when talking, repeats the same phrases over and over (especially meaningless phrases), and gets example problems wrong more often than right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	3	67402	4/22/07	Its so funny to see other comments. I took a class with him, and I understand what these people felt. He wasnt really great in teaching since you dont really get him. This class is good for those who can study on thier own. What I like about his class was that he gave us a review paper for exam which was exactly the same to the exam material.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67402	3/12/06	Worst math teacher I have ever had. If I didnt take calc 1 in high school, I woould have failed just like some of my friends. He did make my friend a deal though to get him to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	5	67402	10/26/05	its a hard class especally for 1st year students. if u ever get stuck go to the text book or his wed site
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67402	6/20/05	I ended up withdrawing from this course because THIS GUY IS TERRIBLE. He comes into the room and immediately starts rambling on about some topic without telling you what it is or where he is in the text. Monotone voice and he's very judgemental.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67402	10/24/04	Was trying to figure out what hte hell he was doing for 2 hours one day. Later turned out he had been referring to a table in the book and had failed to mention it to the class. A 10 ft pole isnt long enough to get near him with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	NULL	67402	5/21/04	Not very helpful... talks to the board rather than the class. Has an attitude if you ask too many questions. But gives good partial credit when grading. Luckily, the book does a good job of what he's supposed to teach, so the material is still learnable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67402	11/21/03	this teachers sucks the big one
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67402	11/7/03	"welcome to dater analysis"....these words will stick with me for the rest of my life....these are the words that i will think of as my first born is entering the world....these are the words that i will ultimately end up committing suicide to.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67402	8/30/03	Worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life. He is usually late to class, lectures while facing the chalkboard, & rarely if ever answers questions or even looks at the class. If u get stuck w/ him, just read the book, his class is worthless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Gruber	1.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67402	12/10/02	Stay away. Class size is usually 1/3 by the end of add-drop, less by withdrawl.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christina Gullo	5.0	2	Business	800	2	5	5	2	1221707	1/14/09	Interesting class. New way of looking at things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christina Gullo	5.0	2	Business	800	5	5	5	5	1221707	12/5/08	Great class - uses assessment tools and explains them well. Would recommend to all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	0	Engineering		1	3	1	3	126970	9/20/07	Difficult to understand. The only correct solution to a problem is "his" solution. The time and energy required to get a decent grade in his class will impact the rest of your schedule and possibly your GPA. Avoid his classes at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering	344	4	5	4	2	126970	4/28/07	I thought this class was great. The homework was somewhat difficult, but the homework questions ALWAYS appeared on the tests and sometimes in the exact wording. He was always very helpful outside of class as well. I recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering	344	3	5	5	5	126970	11/21/06	Awesome professor. Explains everything, answers questions well, always in his office for help. Tends to go kind of fast, so keep up with the notes. You pretty much have to read the book to do good on homework, and if u understand the homework the tests are pretty much identical to the homework. If u dont know how to do hw, go to his office and ask!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		2	4	3	2	126970	10/31/06	Difficult class, you absolutely NEED to read all chapters covered in class. He will summarize a chapter and expect you to know all equations from it on the exams. Also very strict grading on homework where you solve for an answer, no partial credit for correct use of a method if the answer is wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	126970	9/27/05	we got 4 homework problems for each class, ive had no trouble catching up after missing a week of homework he only collects it on test days. he makes himself available to everyone at many times. does not single students out for asking "dumb questions" or questions at all. very interactive and effective class environment. VERY neat notes and structured problems keep you organized in even the most complexed questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	126970	12/20/03	great professor, teaches by examples. very helpful, knows the answer to everything. tests are somewhat difficult, lots of hw
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		1	3	4	3	126970	5/27/07	Dr. Gupta is a very difficult professor, but if you READ the book, and DO the HOMEWORK, you'll do fine on the exams. He doesn't play around, but is extremely fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering	344	2	5	4	4	126970	11/27/06	Gupta is a really smart man, you will need to take a lot of notes to do well and always do the homework for yourself because he pulls questions directly from his homework and puts them on the exam, so you will want to know them well. Materials Science is just a tough class in general but if you pay attention, you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	126970	11/1/06	Very hard class. He is a nice person but terrible teacher. He may have mastered Mat Sci, but he still makes beginner mistakes in his spelling and formula writing, making things very confusing. A 123*321 is 123.321 in his class. Honestly your best bet is to read each chapter and memorize it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	126970	10/20/05	I had Gupta for Statics, Mechanics and Dyanmics. He forced me to learn these subjects very very well in order to pass the class. He was very helpful outside of class with any questions I had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	0	Engineering		2	2	2	2	126970	6/20/05	I have to disagree with both comments here. He is a very hard proff who gives excessive amounts of homework. Also, if you don't structure your solution HIS way(even if yours is correct) you get no credit. Chain smoker and it shows.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vinnie Gupta	3.8	2	Engineering		2	5	5	NULL	126970	2/11/03	One of ME's best, but very hard...lots of HW
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Haake	2.3	0	Information Technology	745	2	1	1	1	1009917	11/3/11	I took this class online. She was very unorganized. Posted assignments haphazardly. Instead of the week being from Monday to Monday she went from Wednesday or Thursday to Tuesday. I do NOT recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Haake	2.3	0	Information Technology		3	1	1	3	1009917	11/9/07	Managing Online content: poor, too many see this and that without actual pages. Responding to questions poor: too many "see below", unclear, some questions not responded to at all. Group and individual components have same deadlines. Class content leftover crammed into last few weeks, behind on syllabus. Professor clearly not focused on her work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Haake	2.3	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	1009917	9/16/09	Had her for intro to biocomputing. Was a nice woman and fair at grading. Tests can be tricky. Textbook use is low and I wouldn't recommend buying it as it's expensive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	313	2	5	5	4	902347	3/2/13	Very good teacher. He is very clear and helpful. If you stop complaining, do the work and study hard you should do well. If you don't put in the effort and the complain online then you may not do as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		2	5	5	5	902347	2/5/13	Extremely helpful. Always willing to meet with a student. I am giving him the Chilli pepper he deserves.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	5	5	5	4	902347	2/4/12	Dr. Hach is great teacher who provides great lessons for students in University Physics. Some may not like him because he demands more from his students but it is a very effective way to get students to understand the material better. I would recommend taking him if you want a great understanding of physics along with a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	2	5	4	5	902347	1/18/12	If you don't care about physics at all and want an easy A, don't take his class. If you actually want to learn physics, this guy is great and you will learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	212	3	5	5	4	902347	7/27/11	I highly recommend, probably the best physics professor I've ever had. Very helpful and really knows his stuff. If you ever need help with something, Dr. Hach will go well out of his way to help you. The course doesn't have easy material but if you pay attention to his lectures and do all the workshop activities, you will do very well in this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	211	1	4	4	4	902347	1/30/11	very strick but will explain things well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	2	4	5	5	902347	8/6/10	This guy is a beast. He'll quote Jay-Z in his lectures. Probably the BEST physics teacher I've had at lecturing. You really know your stuff just by listening to him. Teaches well above and beyond the calling of University Physics. If you're looking for an easy grade, don't take. If you love physics and want to know more than others, he's the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	1	Physics	313	1	2	4	1	902347	5/24/10	So I wish I could give a negative score for difficulty because this class was(is for some) the most difficult thing I have ever done. I can't believe this is required for Computer Science major. I can honestly say I don't have any plans to ever use physics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		2	4	3	3	902347	2/20/10	I have not had Dr. Hach for three years, but I have worked as his TA for the last two quarters. To keep it simple, being successful in physics takes a certain problem solving skill. Those skills can't be taught, they are developed in practice. He will challenge you and is not easy, but if you apply yourself you will come out knowing more than ever
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		2	1	3	3	902347	11/17/09	Not the worst professor i have had but he is definitly sitting comfortably in the 3rd seat. dont take him. if you ask him for help he says look in the book. i have never learned anything from the man. his lectures are mono tone and boring. his hw load isnt bad; 1 assignment a week. he expects that you understand everything before he teaches it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	211	4	4	4	3	902347	2/8/13	Lecture slides helpful and clear. keeps lecture lite and not too serious while going over topics. He know that the lab the school gives us are so old and tries to spice them up. After-class quizzes are tough if you don't pay attention to lecture, they're very subjective to what he went over. Homework helps a ton with the tests he gives.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	3	4	4	4	902347	5/26/12	He was extremely helpful in the first half of the semster, making all the information clear and interesting. Post the second exam he just stopped teaching us. He stood at the board and talked to us in a muffled monotone voice, which did not help us learn. He gives a lot of work, but if you do the work, you can get a good grade. Exams are fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	523	1	4	4	4	902347	1/24/12	Dr. Hach remains a beast in my book. He is one of the more (if not most) strict professors I've had, however, in doing so he promotes excellence in students. You'll work you butt off for the grad you deserve end of story. If you don't care, he doesn't. If you try and go for help he'll do everything he can to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	1	Physics	313	2	2	3	3	902347	11/14/11	VERY full of himself. Minimally better than other physics professors. He doesn't explain the material thoroughly. His jokes are not nearly as funny as he thinks and students only laugh to kiss his butt. Complains about his job and speaks poorly of his colleagues.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		2	5	4	2	902347	1/30/11	Wonderful teacher. my favorite teacher at RIT thus far. He is there if you need him. and very helpful if you pay attention and still dont understand. If you disrespect him or the class, he wont help you. Incredibly organized and seems to have the best type of grading system for learning. I wish all my classes had something similar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	1	Physics	313	1	2	4	4	902347	8/20/10	His lectures keep your interest, he likes throw in jokes and references to rap music. His class is VERY hard but if you follow his lectures you can get through it. Not always the most helpful, he often tells you go to read the text instead. Very strict grader and doesn't make exceptions to the rules, but if you want to learn this is the teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		3	5	3	3	902347	5/24/10	Very good teacher, will help if you ask.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	313	1	5	4	5	902347	4/22/10	Wonderful professor. Difficult but you will learn alot. Professional and always willing to help. A+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	212	3	5	5	4	902347	1/27/10	I honestly do not know why his ratings are so low, this guy is awesome. Great professor, good teacher, fair grader, just do the work and pay attention and you'll do fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	1	Physics		2	3	3	4	902347	7/23/09	Way to much hw, leaves during class, for 10 min periods....Not really too helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		1	1	3	1	902347	5/26/09	He never returned test back at an acceptable time. I had to pick up my third test the day before the final (within a 45 minute time span). The mastering physics assignments took a ridiculous amount of time to go. The guy just sucked overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		1	1	2	1	902347	5/13/09	I'm very surprised to see decent ratings down for Hach. Was one of the worst professors I've had at RIT, and I've had some bad ones. So out of touch with himself and the world he is unable to communicate with you at all. After one day of class you'll know exactly what I mean if you decide to take him. My suggestion is don't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		1	5	5	4	902347	4/21/09	He is extremely difficult. He's a great guy and I learned a lot, the best physics professors I've ever had. Amount of homework is unreasonable ~20hrs a week. Be prepared to do a LOT of work if you take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		2	4	4	3	902347	3/12/09	He's a very good physics professor. The best physics professor I've had at RIT. I don't know what some of you are talking about. Maybe if some of you showed up to class regularly you wouldn't feel this way. He is very good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		1	1	3	1	902347	12/8/08	Probably one of the worst professor in this school. Gives a LOT OF HW, doesn't do any problems in class and writes very small in a lecture hall and half the time you can't read what he is writing. If you want to get a D or a C if you're lucky take him. Pretty much if you want to learn physics three on your own take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	311	2	4	5	4	902347	2/4/08	Hach is easy to confront to ask questions. He'll explain all questions, maybe a little too in depth. Reading the book is a key factor of success. Webassigns help a lot if you try to learn from them and trad. hws are really hard, but based on effort. You have to learn the harder material on your own, but he basics are taught..welcome to RIT Physics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	1	Physics	311	1	4	2	5	902347	3/13/07	Assigned a boatload more homework than other profs I knew of. 3 webassigns of 10+ problems per week, plus a "traditional" homework assignment of 6 problems--usually long, complicated ones. Class average on tests usually between 50 and 60ish, he sets this as a C. You will learn it well, but because of the huge amount of homework required of you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	311	1	5	3	3	902347	2/8/07	Class is really tough, lots of work hard tests. Sometimes can teach a little too theoretical with not enough examples which makes it hard to apply to real life problems. But that said he makes up for it by being amazingly helpful and the most approachable teacher I've ever had. He's tough, but is always more than glad to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	2	5	4	1	902347	11/18/06	The most accessible teacher I've ever had. I went to his office and his building was closed so I knocked on his window and he let me in the building and helped me. Really hard tests that are too long but curved. I worked my way up to a B on the last one. I'd recommend him, esp. if you're a fast test-taker. Drops lowest hw and webassign
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	3	5	5	5	902347	10/23/06	He is a good teacher and helps along with the worksheets in class if your stuck. He calls on people in class from his "notecard" system with your names on them. His tests are a bit hard but fair and he seems to curve them generously. He is ALWAYS in his office hours when he says he will be and then some. He is always willing to help out a stude
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	902347	5/19/09	Terrible professor. The work load is unreasonable compared to that of other Phys 3 classes. He does not return graded work for weeks so you have no idea how you are doing in the class. Be prepared to teach yourself most of the material related to the "mastering physics" because they will often be vague and very confusing questions with errors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	902347	4/28/09	Notice that Hach is the only physics professor with good ratings. He gives a lot of work, but the load is manageable. You might not get an A, but you will understand the material better than anybody else and have fun at the same time. If you want to actually learn the material, go for Hach. On the other hand, if you want an easy A look elsewhere.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	1	4	5	4	902347	4/5/09	A lot of the posts say there is a lot of work, but here is what a lot of work means: two webassign assignments per week, one "traditional" homework sheet per week (8 difficult questions) that takes 2-3 hours. Also, he is very slow on giving back papers. Week five is about to start and he has yet to hand back a single paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		2	1	2	3	902347	2/3/09	Why is this man teaching? His attitude toward our entire class was terrible. Good luck trying to ask a question with out having your head ripped off or him making you feel stupid. He is the worst physics prof in the department, stick with Hodge instead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		1	5	4	4	902347	2/27/08	Very Difficult But he is a great professor. LOTS of homework, but if you are willing to work hard you can learn alot more from him then other professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		1	5	5	4	902347	10/26/07	He is one of the best teachers in the department. The course is difficult but physics is supposed to be difficult, and he is extremely accessible to help, so it shouldn't be a problem to do well in his class. If you're willing to work, I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	0	Physics		2	2	2	3	902347	2/12/07	Doesn't really give answers in class when you ask to see something because he doesn't to waste time showing everybody the proper way of doing something. Doesn't teach a lot of stuff, expects you to figure things out with the labs on your own, but he never gives the answers in class, so you don't know what you're doing ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	311	2	5	5	4	902347	2/5/07	Absolutely the most professional and helpful professor I have taken yet. Very knowledgeable and explains concepts concisely but throughly. Tests are difficult but not impossible. He assigns a large amount of HW. You will definitely learn the material from him (unless you are unconscious or a slacker). Always willing to help outside of class. A+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics	312	3	5	5	4	902347	10/23/06	long, complicated tests with crazy curves. he goes with 0-20 is an f and every 20% up from there. more helpful than anyone ever. makes bad jokes and raps sometimes. uses big words (bring a thesaurus). not too strict about error on lab calcs. hes just a smart guy who knows more than he has to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edwin Hach	3.8	2	Physics		3	5	4	5	902347	10/19/06	Awesome teacher. His tests aren't easy, but are generously curved. He assigns a lot of homework, but they're all very short...keeps the material fresh in your head. He's very very helpful, though. Always in his office and loves to help with any problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Hager	5.0	2	Accounting	801	4	5	5	2	1487540	6/27/11	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Hailstone	5.0	2	Imaging Science		5	5	5	4	1434597	5/11/10	Hailstone is the man. Explains everything clearly and communicates knowledge well. The tests are 3 questions long and the questions should be no surprise if you have done the work. If you have a 95 average before the final exam and after the 8th homework you are excused from the final. All University Physics Professors should take note.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Hailstone	5.0	2	Imaging Science	314	5	5	5	4	1434597	4/26/10	Easily the best physics professor ever. The way he grades the class ends up meaning that if you got a 70 on all three tests, all the homeworks AND the final, you end up with a B in the class. You can't NOT do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	345	2	2	1	3	67404	2/22/13	DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. This class was terrible. Ridiculous amounts of HW. Halavin rambles on and on about nothing, writes all over the board (starts on the left, moves to the right, rights across and in between stuff he has already written) making it impossible to take notes. If there is any way to avoid his classes, do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	67404	3/4/12	Easy class. No homework or quizzes and only one easy exam and final. Only class need to attend is day before exam. He gives out list of all problems on exam. Then went to see him and told me how to do all the problems. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	1	67404	1/27/12	Like many of the other raters have said, Halavin's lectures are useless and he is cold and hard to contact. He gives hours and hours of homework, doesn't explain things well, and puts down students. I taught myself the material in this course through the textbook alone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	345	1	1	1	2	67404	2/7/11	Engineering Stats (1016-345). Was one of the worst professors I've had at RIT. Did not give enough time on the exams. His "lectures" cover material weeks ahead of when the homework is due. His "lectures" are also useless, learn to use the book as your sole reference. You will do well in this course if you've already taught it for 25 years like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67404	1/7/11	Knows statistics extremely well, but an abysmally bad teacher. Writes illegibly, and rambles without getting to the point. Assumes students know symbols without explanation. Has refused to provide students with original literature when asked. Textbook not very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	3	67404	11/10/09	He is very hard to follow during lecture. Tends to write all over the board which makes it hard to take notes. Gives good handouts though some are hard to read due to his hand writing. Exams you pick 4 out 6 problems to solve. Homeworks are important to understanding the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	314	3	2	2	3	67404	11/9/08	Not too good of a professor. His lectures are not helpful at all. If you want to learn the material for the class, you will have to rely on the book and his handouts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67404	6/22/07	I will definately give him -F for his teaching performance. In fact I wud like to penalize him for choosing teaching profession. Because he got no teaching skill and absolutely no respect for anyone. No more questions, answers or doubts....
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	5	67404	11/20/05	Had him for Actuarial Mathematics, pretty hard class, but I think everyone got an A on account of effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	320	2	2	1	NULL	67404	10/17/03	Knowledgable, but doesn't know how to teach. He runs through the chapters showing examples, but does not explain anything or methodically describe the steps.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	345	1	1	1	2	67404	2/17/13	Completely Incompetent. By far the worst professor I've encountered at RIT, and I've been through the University Physics sequence. Homework assignments are lengthy and will do next to nothing to prepare you for his exams. His lectures are disorganized and weeks ahead of exam material. AVOID! HE SHOULD BE FIRED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	351	2	1	2	3	67404	2/17/12	Professor Halavin's lectures were weeks ahead of exams and homework which made them unhelpful; I taught myself the material by reading the book. Homework was ridiculously difficult and long. Tests were easy in comparison to the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	309	2	1	1	3	67404	5/12/11	Halavin is almost impossible to contact outside of his office hours. He does not respond to emails, and when you do show up for his office hours, it seems like he just wants you to leave. The notes to gives in lectures are virtually useless and if you don't buy the book you're screwed. Makes students feel like their dumb when they make mistakes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	67404	1/21/11	Dr. Halavin is thoroughly incomprehensible. Illegible handwriting, and confusing lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	559	2	1	2	3	67404	11/12/09	Useless lectures, I learned everything from the book. I guess he expects you to teach yourself this whole course. Exams are open book/open note, but if you do not know the material off the back of your hand you will never finish in time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	1	67404	10/13/09	He is not very good at conveying information. His tests are easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics	314	2	2	2	4	67404	11/25/07	Halavin was terrible. He taught math using PowerPoint. He had a lot of handouts, which was good when you got stuck with homework (which was inevitable) and studying for his exams. The exams were open-book, open-note, and do-4-of-6-problems, and I still only got about 75% on them. And I'm a straight-A student going for a Masters in Math!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67404	3/27/07	Halavin is mean, insulting, unwelcoming, unhelpful, hard to contact, confusing, stuck-up and much much more. I haven't spoken to one person this quarter that likes him. I have no idea who these other raters could possibly be talking about. He teaches a million miles an hour and talks as if you already know everything. I'll never take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67404	11/18/04	Great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Halavin	1.9	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	NULL	67404	9/10/03	Class not too hard, alright teacher, guess you could take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Halpern	5.0	2	Fine Arts	101	3	5	5	5	1700368	3/30/13	Greg was a fantastic teacher that only wants his students to succeed. He is harsh with grading sometimes usually he only gives out B's unless you work REALLY hard. But the grade doesn't even matter because you will learn so much from him and enjoy his class that it won't even matter. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Halpern	5.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	3	1700368	1/24/13	I was very new to photography and Greg did everything in his power to help me thrive. It is obvious that he wants all of his students to succeed. He is very caring and very smart. He knows a lot about photography and he shares his knowledge with great clarity. He also just loves it which is ultimately infectious. Take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	1374452	1/25/12	To be honest, in her class i was THAT kid who tried so hard to act like i wasn't having fun, and i hated her class. she was happy all the time and it threw me off-seemed fake. but looking back, she's just a genuinely amazing person. she consoled me with a family death, gave me a winning recommendation and i still keep in contact with me 3 yrs later
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	5	5	5	1	1374452	7/29/11	Andrea is great. Even after FYE is over, she is really helpful in any way she can be, even if it's just someone to talk to/get coffee with, or someone to recommend someone else. She's wonderful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	4	1374452	10/27/10	greatest teacher ever. easy, just go to class, attendance is everything. she is the sweetest lady too. I love her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	3	4	1	1374452	3/4/10	Pointless class but nice teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	4	1374452	11/30/11	She is the nicest professor. You are required to meet with her 1 on 1 for half an hour sometime during the course and she just asks you questions about how your classes are going. So sweet, willing to go out of her way to help you with any problems you're having.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1374452	1/23/11	Graded based on attendance. Very very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1374452	3/10/10	She's a sweet teacher, she's very helpful also. But the class is blahhh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Handy	4.8	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1374452	12/8/09	Cool teacher. She makes the daily topics interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	2	Engineering		5	4	3	5	1253652	2/22/12	He is a nice guy, easy professor but not good one. I'm smarter and know more about AutoCAD than him. I've found his errors on homework and exams. He is very picky on grading. i.e. if the text is readable on the drawing but it is just not large enough because he thinks so, he would take points off. If you work hard this class, you will be ok.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	2	Engineering		4	5	3	2	1253652	11/27/10	Surveying- Was a great teacher in lecture although he has a slight accent. But you can figure out what he says. Read the notes he posts online, show up and do your homework you'll get an A or B. Also if you are struggling he is so happy to help, you just have to come to him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	0	Engineering	530	4	1	1	2	1253652	1/26/10	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	0	Engineering	530	4	1	1	1	1253652	3/4/09	Terrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1253652	10/27/11	Take an interest in the class, and make an effort, you'll pass. go to him for help if needed, hell take the time to explain things if you ask the right questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	0	Engineering	530	3	2	2	3	1253652	10/8/10	Nice guy very poor instructor. Tests are hard and irrelevant to the lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Hanna	2.5	0	Engineering		4	1	1	1	1253652	4/10/09	Horrible teacher, pretty useless, avoid his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Hansen	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	4	4	1101529	2/7/08	Professor Hansen is a very nice guy, and pretty knowledgeable on the subject. He brings in or takes you to see guest speakers and shows a lot of videos from tv shows. Overall it's an interesting course, some photo and crime scene drawing. Tests are very easy and come from his handouts. Good professor, easy class... worth taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Hanzlik	3.5	2	Physics		4	4	3	2	1727382	5/27/12	Electricity and Magnetism in Biosystems was one of the easier classes I've had to take because she tells you exactly what you need to know for the test. Shes unorganized, but really smart and understanding. She really wants you to know the material, but understands that you need to take some certain points away from the class and focuses on those.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	283	2	5	5	4	902481	3/1/13	He's a Math Marine because he never leaves a fallen man behind! He taught calculus very well with lots of interesting concrete examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	5	902481	11/17/12	Dr. Harkin is a very easy professor and is lenient/helpful. However, he is not clear about expectations for assignments and doesn't seem to really care about the class he's teaching. Take him if you want an easy A, but not if you really want to learn or be challenged.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	713	2	5	5	4	902481	7/25/12	Best math professor there is! Makes the material clear and easy to understand. He really cares that you get the concepts and helps you until you do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	0	Mathematics		5	1	2	4	902481	12/27/11	If you are looking for an easy A, take him. He teaches very little, hard to find him on campus. His grading is so lenient and careless. I do not want to take him again, I came to RIT to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	902481	5/30/10	Very smart professor, probably the best professor in the entire RIT campus. He takes the time to explain the materials and gives lots of extra credit. He gives really little homework and hard workshops, but ask him to help you and you will learn alot. I fell asleep alot in his class because he is so monotonous. GREAT GUY!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	282	4	5	4	5	902481	2/23/10	Easy to fair grader. Goes over many examples in class. However, few lectures can be BORING as a result. On the other end, some lectures can be very fun due to his really dorky comments that just make you laugh. He is a nice person. If you miss a day, he will copy his notes for you. If you ask him personally for help, he is great at clarifying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	902481	1/12/07	Good professor. He doesn't teach many classes, so you get most of his attention. Easy grader. Teaches with examples a lot. If you learn through example, this is the guy to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	4	3	902481	10/20/06	I had him for DiffEQ. He teaches the stuff pretty well, and ties in practical examples whenever possible. He gives a few tests per quarter, which are moderately easy. Homework is also easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	902481	2/28/13	Truly excellent professor. He gives very clear lectures. Cares whether students understand the material and he is approachable and helpful in office hours. Would definitely take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	420	3	5	5	4	902481	11/15/12	Best math prof at RIT. Very helpful explaining stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	420	2	5	5	4	902481	5/10/12	Excellent professor if you are an engineering major needing to learn complex variables. Gives clear lectures with relevant examples. He very gladly helped me understand HW questions I had. Absolutely recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	902481	11/15/11	Hands down the best math professor at RIT. Engineering math was very interesting and he taught the material with really good examples and homework are relatively challenging, but if you go ask for help, he will gladly help you. Like how he talked a lot about MW3 and WoW lol, great professor! Also, he grades fairly!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	282	5	5	5	4	902481	3/9/10	Awesome professor! Lots and lots of examples. That's basically all his lectures are. But his dorky comments keep it from being drawn out. Few homework assignments but have a decent amount of problems on them. There are spread out enough that you don't feel overwhelmed. He gives you a week to do them. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	282	5	5	3	5	902481	2/2/07	Awesome Professor!!! His class is really easy..he is very helpful and goes at a decent pace so you can catch up with the class. His workshops are really easy and quizzes/tests are entirely based on the stuff he talks about in class. I would defenitely take his class again!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Harkin	4.6	2	Mathematics	281	4	5	5	3	902481	12/5/06	Great teacher, uses clear examples when teaching. Exams are pretty easy and homework only once in a while. (Although the assignments can be relatively large.) Very approachable and class can often be amusing with comments so dorky you have to laugh. "Now it's time for some sweet calculations!!!"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	3	564865	3/4/13	Prof. Harris was a decent teacher for our 2D Animation class. She was good at picking out media that the students would find interesting related to the topics we were discussing, but I didn't learn all that much from the lectures. Very nice and approachable outside of class, though. Class was not difficult, but time-consuming.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	0	Computer Science	229	4	1	2	3	564865	4/4/11	ATTENTION INCOMING FIRST YEARS SCHEDULED TO TAKE FOUNDATIONS OF NEW MEDIA WITH THIS PROF: SWITCH BEFORE YOU GET HERE. She can't answer a question to save her life. I quickly learned to just stop asking questions because every time I did she would give me an answer completely unrelated to my question- "extremely frustrating" is an understatement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	0	Computer Science		5	1	2	2	564865	5/8/10	She is beyond useless. She thinks she knows anything about art. I have no idea how she was placed to teach a senior level course...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	0	Computer Science	295	4	2	2	2	564865	12/4/09	Intro to Interactive Media class was a waste of time. I barely learned anything and the lectures were very boring power point presentations. I got an A in the class with minimal effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	1	Computer Science	409	1	3	2	5	564865	11/20/07	One of the worst. More time spent researching useless information than actually learning.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	2	Computer Science	320	4	5	5	5	564865	3/1/05	Very good professor. I have over 6 years of experience with HTML, yet I still learned a lot from her. Some of it could be hard if you don't have a strong web background, but she is very consise in her teaching and likes to engage the class to ensure everybody understands the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	1	564865	2/24/13	Professor Harris was always friendly, and she was flexible with deadlines. 2D Animation requires a lot of work, but as long as you complete your projects, you'll be fine. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I've never had a problem with her. This was actually the second course I took with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	0	Computer Science	320	2	1	1	5	564865	7/28/10	Cheerful but chooses boring & irrelevant topics to base student websites on. Other sections even thought it was horrible. Teaches via Powerpoint presentations that are boring & lack explanations. I love Web Design but she totally destroyed what I thought would be a fun class. No creativity involved at all & it took weeks to actually do any coding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	0	Computer Science	295	4	1	1	3	564865	4/20/10	Bad teacher. Did not teach much, just read off power point presentations. Didn't grade a single assignment until week 7. I got an A in the course but it was a waste of time. Try to avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	1	Computer Science	320	3	1	4	3	564865	10/3/08	The class is not difficult and she doesnt mind accepting late papers for full credit. the problem is that she researches information that is non-essential to learning HTML and she gets really excited way too much. "We have a test today!! WOOT!!" and the rest of the class is like oh yeah test. Very energetic, but not very helpful or beneficial.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wyllona Harris	2.4	1	Computer Science		1	3	2	1	564865	5/27/06	A lot of work! More work than any of the other section. Lecture was a joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	16574	9/4/05	Greatest math teacher at RIT.. just do your work and if you need help.. ask him!! I dont understand how you cannot do well in his class!

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	16574	4/23/05	He's one of the best professors in the math department. Soooo willing to help you with work and very fair in grading. I was told though he's number theory class is a lot better, but that just might be due to the subject :) He's awesome!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	16574	2/26/03	This guy was awesome. He was smart, and he told me I was a genius.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	16574	2/18/03	Very good instructor - probably the best math professor I've had. (and funny)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Hart	4.1	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	NULL	16574	12/3/02	he's ok. i just don't like the way he talks

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science	530	3	5	5	5	69290	5/17/12	Telephony and networking are really his passion, and he has a ridiculous amount of knowledge that he wants to impart on his students. Class is not incredibly challenging if you attend class and pay attention... TAKE NOTES, lots of important details. Workload is average for ANSA advanced courses - labs, online quizzes, and a project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	69290	4/24/11	Tough but fair. Makes you think but you learn a lot. Dude knows networking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	0	Computer Science	550	1	2	2	4	69290	3/7/11	The only professor I have ever met to take points off for citing sources in a formal paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science	530	1	5	5	5	69290	11/1/09	Bruce is an excellent professor. He knows networks. Telephony is one of his easier classes but you learn a lot in the labs. I always enjoy a class with the colonel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	0	Computer Science	530	1	2	2	5	69290	3/2/07	Miserable professor - I wish I could sum him up without foul language. I would have been better off using the tuition money to heat my apartment last winter
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	69290	10/19/05	Not easy but definately worth the work.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	69290	10/10/02	Excellent teacher, cares about students, very informative
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science	530	3	5	5	4	69290	3/6/12	The man knows his stuff; his classes will make you work, but if you do the work, you'll do fine. Show up to class and take notes on what he says, not just what he writes. Quizzes are ridiculously tricky. He'll help you if you are struggling and ask. His classes are notorious for being a lot of work but he makes sure you learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	69290	4/24/11	550 Tough but fair. Advanced class so we had to think a bit but we learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	0	Computer Science	540	1	2	1	4	69290	4/23/10	Extremely unorganized and expects you to live of to standards he himself doesn't. For our first project, which took half of the quarter, he didn't even give us the rubric until a week before the project was do. He refused to write anything in stone about the project because he had no clue about it himself. AVOID if at all possible! Never again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		1	4	4	3	69290	2/16/09	Bruce will make you work for your grade. Very knowledgeable of the material. He doesn't curve grades and will make you work for the answers. One of the best professors I had. pjb
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	69290	2/21/06	Very smart professor, great teacher. Tough and expects a lot. Highly recommended but be prepared to do the work - and have some fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	0	Computer Science	413	2	1	1	5	69290	10/8/05	not so easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	69290	8/24/05	Best professor I ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Hartpence	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	69290	10/24/02	Very good teacher, knows networks
Rochester Institute of Technology	John-Paul Hatala	3.0	1	Service Learning	735	3	2	4	2	1729257	6/6/12	The professor do not pay attention to the assignments assigned in the syllabus, therefore just review the readings. The projects are the problem he ask for certain things and when you delivered the project then he says that he was looking for something else. Think it twice before take a class with JP. Get an A will be HARD.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		3	4	5	4	1040179	11/10/11	Dry, sarcastic humor. really funny, good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science	211	2	5	5	2	1040179	3/15/11	Great professor, introduces current topics with foundations of American policies and keeps it fun with a few jokes here and there. It's a manageable amount of work and the class discussions can be interesting, would recommend to take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		2	5	5	3	1040179	10/27/10	3rd class with her, as long as you scan the readings and start the paper early she's awesome, otherwise shes awesome but might give you an evil stare
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		3	5	4	4	1040179	3/7/10	Great professor. Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		1	3	4	3	1040179	6/26/09	She's great. She has high standards, but that doesn't mean you can't meet them and do well. This class was interesting for someone who took it out of pure curiosity. As a brief overview, this class involves alot of reading and some of itis hard to understand. Sooo if you don't like reading hard material then I'd suggest you not take the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		4	4	3	2	1040179	3/18/09	I had no interest in coming to the class originally. Throughout the class I became more interested and to me she was eye candy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	0	Political Science	513	1	1	2	1	1040179	11/17/08	Like people said before, there are 20+ readings and a quiz each day in the class. Unless you really understand int'l relations, you wont do well in this class. She lectures the entire class, but in a very unorganized way and her notes make no sense. Definitely take this course with a different professor if you're just taking IR for a LA credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	0	Political Science		2	2	2	1	1040179	9/28/08	International Relations: She gives 15+ pages to read AND a quiz for each class. Half of class is spent talking about current events (which is USELESS for exams or hw). It is extremely difficult to take notes because she doesn't talk about them in ANY logical order. Not fun whatsoever, and my entire class would agree with me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science	214	3	5	5	3	1040179	3/5/08	Great professor, very helpful outside of class. Interesting classes! Would take class with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science	101	4	5	5	5	1040179	10/19/07	Lauren Hall ROCKS! Best class you could take. Will make you want to change your major. Eat your wheaties cuz you're gonna need your strength to keep up with this mensa-dynamo! Rock on Lauren Hall, don't leave us! We'll bring you giant slices of carrot cake if only you'll stay in Rha Cha Cha!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		2	5	5	4	1040179	3/31/11	Excellent class if you want to learn. Objective, collected, and very knowledgeable. Reasonable (but not excessively lenient) grader and willing to help if need be.. Hello! Winning!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	1040179	1/31/11	Great teacher! She is very knowledgeable about politics in America, and uses that to her advantage by pounding you with good information. Pop quizzes are easy if you read the text. Mid-term and final are straight from study guides that you can fill in as you go along. Take her!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science	101	2	5	5	1	1040179	8/14/10	Intro to international relations, liked it a lot. Had no interest in the class or the subject. she used 100% online readings, DO THE READINGS! great to have no book but had to do all of the readings. very nice and great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		3	5	4	3	1040179	6/26/09	She is great. She has high standards but that doesn't mean you can't reach them and do well. This class involves a lot of reading some of which is hard. However, this course was interesting coming from someone who took it out of pure curiosity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	0	Political Science		1	1	1	3	1040179	4/23/09	I only took her class because a friend told me too (apparently Dr. Hall plays favorites). Taking her class was a huge mistake! She is an unreasonably hard grader on terrible exams and does not care if you are unhappy with your grade on an exam you spent 4 days doing. WOW. Do not take her. Take Kenneally he is freakin awesome and funny!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science	460	3	4	5	2	1040179	1/28/09	Great professor, but sometimes has trouble keeping the annoying kids from running away with the discussion. She makes good points, tests only on the topics she covers in class (and if you don't get to a planned topic, she removes it from the test). Knows what she is talking about, but recognizes that we know less and doesn't penalize for it. 9/10
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	0	Political Science		2	1	1	1	1040179	11/16/08	This class is the worst class I have ever taken in my life. You do 25 page readings to answer a 2 question quiz. It hardly matters if you do the readings because even if you read it, you won't get the questions right. Discussions in class are boring...bring a laptop and play games. Discussions also do not help you for the midterm or final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		3	5	5	4	1040179	4/22/08	Very knowledgeable, and helpful. She is great in lecture, keeps in interesting but fun. lots of reading
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lauren Hall	4.0	2	Political Science		3	5	5	3	1040179	2/27/08	I had her for International Relations. I would take another on of her classes in a heartbeat. She is very knowledgeable and will answer just about any question you ask. Class is actually entertaining. It does require ALOT of reading but it was worth it. I feel like I learned so much about the International community and now actually watch the new
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	2	Mathematics	328	4	4	4	4	1287213	1/2/13	Somewhat helpful in class. Not always the best at explaining. Homework is all optional and ungraded. Final exam replaces every grade you had in the course that was lower than it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	2	Mathematics	305	5	4	3	4	1287213	4/13/10	I've had him for Multivar and Diff Eq. There are 2 tests, a final, optional homework and 10 quizzes. Each quiz is an exact homework problem. Every grade lower than the final is replaced by it. Some of the lectures can by confusing but he is willing to explain and really tries to get students to understand. If you do the homework you should get an
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	3	1287213	1/27/10	Professor Hamilton is an excellent math teacher. If you attend class and pay attention, he will teach you the material. He makes sure his students understand everything and is very open to questions. His tests really are no surprise, they are much like the homework. I would highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1287213	5/10/12	He is genuinely concerned about his students learning the material and will make sure answer any question students have. Homeworks are handed in for completion, quizzes are hw problems, and tests are just retooled quiz problems. He also has a hilarious dry sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	1	Mathematics	305	3	3	2	5	1287213	2/6/10	Dull lectures. Okay teacher. Quizzes are homework problems. Will drop any grade lower than your final. Assumed you already knew too much. Methods weren't rigorous enough for a math class. Gave you an idea how to do problems, but you really had to work on your own to fully grasp things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hamilton	4.1	2	Mathematics	328	2	5	4	2	1287213	5/15/09	He is extremely helpful and always willing to take the time to explain anything you ask. He also tries very hard to make sure students understand the material rather than just talking and writing on the board. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Hane	3.8	2	Biology		3	4	4	4	1087865	10/21/10	Her lectures are really interesting, but the tests are based on comprehension rather than facts...so they can be a bit tricky. She explains the material very well and is very good about answering questions and emails promptly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Hane	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	5	4	1087865	12/4/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Hane	3.8	1	Biology		4	2	3	3	1087865	1/26/09	Class is seemingly easy and straight forward in her lecture presentations, however when you get the tests back you wonder wtf she was asking you to remember between the lines of the book and her lecture
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		4	5	4	4	665015	4/24/12	A fresh break, Therese works in the field today so her class is up-to-date, interesting and relevant
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design	101	4	4	4	4	665015	5/26/11	Very sweet and knowledgeable. Has real-world experience and is always willing to help. She isn't as strict as Jason and Adam, but is a welcome, and beneficial vacation from them. Her classes aren't easy, but they are very helpful and enjoyable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		2	5	5	5	665015	12/11/08	I've have Therese for several classes and though I wouldn't label any of them easy, I certainly wouldn't have taken them with any other teacher. She pushes everyone to do their best and I've learned so much from her- if you have the chance defiantly take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		2	5	5	5	665015	5/1/08	I love Therese! She seems like she really knows what she's talking about and I've learned a lot from her. Her assignments are clear and she's reasonable about due dates. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	1	Design	101	4	3	3	5	665015	2/11/08	Really hot, and SEEMS great when you're there, but once you get out of class you realize that her suggestions were completely incomprehensible, if nto utterly useless. She has a great eye for design, but is really pitiful when it comes to giving real, solid suggestions. Very non-commital. LOVES her job, and design in general though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		4	5	5	4	665015	7/22/07	She's an excellent teacher who shows interest in her student's development. She's very understanding and very approachable. I learned a lot from her and gained much more. She requires you to read chapters for some quizzes but always returns the results asap. I had a lot of fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		3	5	5	5	665015	4/28/06	Therese is a fantastic instructor, she is always around and willing to help you out if you're having any trouble. She's also very understanding of personal issues. Also you are able to redo any project over the semester to improve your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		3	5	5	5	665015	10/26/05	a great teacher and role model. thinks with creativity and critiques with honesty. projects are fun but practical for portfolio development. provides a good mentor for the graphic design students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		4	5	4	3	665015	11/29/11	She seems harsh at times but she is really interested in you doing well. If you put in the work she will work for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		2	5	4	3	665015	2/5/09	Great teacher - one of the best in the program. I enjoy all of her classes, and now that we don't have her, everyone I talk to misses her. She can be tough, with a lot of work being assigned all the time, but it's all worth it and you really improve your skills with her. If you can take a class with her, DO IT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	1	Design		3	2	3	3	665015	5/21/08	Therese is a very very nice lady...however a lot of the time she is very unclear with what she wants. She knows what she is talking about when it comes to design. I don't really think we focused enough on typography and instead focused more on design...which is fine...but i felt a bit misled after the class had ended. Her class is not a joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	1	Design	600	2	2	3	3	665015	4/24/08	cancels class all the time, a huge waste of tuition money. incapable of giving only one project at a time. terrible at responding to emails/requests for feedback in a timely manner.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		3	5	5	5	665015	10/19/07	simply the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		4	5	4	4	665015	2/2/07	She's so cute! I love her as a teacher and as a person, and I'd definitely take classes with her again. She may be a little undecided on how to revise designs sometimes, but she's overall really helpful and gives you a lot of great (if somewhat contradictory) tips. If you get a chance, definitely take a class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		3	5	5	4	665015	11/12/05	Excellent teacher, if you have an opportunity to take one of her classes do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Therese Hannigan	4.4	2	Design		3	5	5	4	665015	10/18/05	Therese rocks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1495825	1/29/13	this man is a gift from MIS heaven hes soo clear and concise and hes always there for anything u need if u dont take him ur a fool!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business	101	3	5	4	2	1495825	11/7/12	Awesome professor! Uses powerpoint as main tool of lecture, but includes modern and relevant examples for everything. Very easy to relate to real life. Would definitely recommend Sean.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business		4	5	5	4	1495825	2/5/12	Professro Hansen is definately the coolest MIS Professor. Very easy and comfrtable to talk to-even if it's small talk. He takes student's opinions into consideration and molds the class after it. Very understanding and willing to help. I wouldn't take an MIS class with another professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business	101	4	5	5	4	1495825	2/14/11	Hansen is one of the coolest MIS professors in the college. If you haven't taken a class with him yet, he's highly informational and entertaining. Definitely worth your time if you can find a section he is teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business	370	3	5	5	5	1495825	1/22/13	One of the best professors at RIT! He is very helpful and knowledgeable about the material. I do believe some of his lectures should include more hands-on practice of material when needed. I would recommend him to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business		3	5	5	4	1495825	2/27/12	THE BEST OF THE BEST!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Hansen	4.9	2	Business	101	4	5	4	2	1495825	7/10/11	Great professor very easy to talk to and helps out whenever you need. just do the work show that you wanna learn and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology		5	5	4	4	1045868	4/9/13	He gets very excited about what he teaches so I loved the class. Its very easy. If you go to class, he gives you exact questions on the exams throughout the lecture. The book he wrote is small and easy to read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	0	Psychology		3	2	2	1	1045868	2/12/13	One thing I didn't notice was that he grades based on the points, so an A will be 99 or 100 overal. Textbook he uses is a book he wrote which is not very pleasant to read. You have to buy the book since he asks you about material from the book. If you are majoring in Psych he might be a good teacher to take, if you are minoring like me, not so much
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	0	Psychology	101	2	1	3	5	1045868	11/29/11	Worst psychology class I have ever taken. Classes were monotone lectures. All communication was to be done through grad students, very hands off with students. 4 grades in total, 2 of which were multiple choice designed to trick and confuse you despite him saying otherwise. Only good thing about this class is that mycourses is laid out very well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	1	Psychology		3	3	3	2	1045868	10/21/10	Overall he's a very easy professor. It's easy to get an A in the class if you show up to every class and do all of the makeup work/extra credit. He allows anyone to take the make-up exams in order to try and score higher which is a great help. I recommend his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	210	2	4	5	3	1045868	5/22/10	Great at explaining things. Cut down on exams from weekly to 2 per quarter. There is also a make-up with each. The entire 10 chapter, 200+ page textbook must be read to get an A. I could've had a B without reading, though. 90/210 points come from attendance. Really fun class, if you want to learn a lot about the good and bad of psychology, take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	1	Psychology	514	4	3	2	2	1045868	2/18/10	hate his grading policy easy class though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	5	1045868	10/23/09	Great professor, favorite so far. Highly recommend this class. Really cares about his students and always willing to help. Offers a lot of extra credit, one paper very easily graded, and a test every week. Doesn't just read off the powerpoint, actually explains things. Lecture material is different from book, so must read. Very passionate. Take!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	202	3	4	4	5	1045868	12/27/08	Roger is a great professor. He and I became friends and spend many hours discussing occult topics and psychology. His classes will get you thinking and participating. Not for those wanting to catch some Z's. If you're there for credits he's going to be hard on you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	441	3	4	4	4	1045868	3/10/08	Amazing teacher, very helpful. Had him two quarters and was great. Sometimes his lectures get a little dull but he is very animated and makes it worth going to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology		4	4	4	4	1045868	2/20/13	Grades are based on a scale of points. Each paper(3 of them) is 10 points and each test (2 of them) are 40 points. You have to get 99 or higher to get an A. Exams are super easy as well as the papers. He wrote his own text which was really easy to read and understand. I would recommend him even though I don't like his grading scale.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	0	Psychology	446	2	2	2	1	1045868	10/23/12	The class isn't impressive. You get no break for two hour class, and it's two hours of lecture and repetitive information. I would not recommend this class. He wrote a book and it was a very thin book, but not very updated. He repeats things in a lecture and it is not worth sitting through for two hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	1	Psychology	201	3	3	3	1	1045868	1/26/11	Decent teacher. He's an older professor and tends to drone with a monotone a bit in his lectures, so if you're careful you will miss something he says. Quizzes and exams come straight from the textbook, so reading it is mandatory. Attendance is mandatory as well. His class is very well organized on MyCourses if you ever have to find something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	0	Psychology		4	1	2	5	1045868	5/30/10	Harnish is a easy professor, but you must attend all the classes to get credit for your activities. He is a jerk when it comes to grading so be prepared and he likes to be really ****ed and obnoxious so don't hesistate to criticize. Overall, I disliked him and he wasn't a great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	1	Psychology	210	4	2	3	1	1045868	3/7/10	This class is very easy to get an A in if you show up to class every day, do all the extra credit, and do moderately well on the weekly exams. Each exam is multiple guess and if you're no good at guessing, like me, your grades will be pretty low. The in-class assignments and xtra credit are what get you an A though. A ton of reading is required.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	5	1045868	10/23/09	Great Professor! Very passionate & really cares about students. Great teaching style, explains things very well. Always uses good examples(situations, videos, pictures, real life experiences). Really nice guy, makes psych very interesting. 20 points extra credit, one paper very easily graded. Makes psych very interesting and easy to learn as well!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	441	4	5	5	4	1045868	2/3/09	Proffessor Harnish is amazing, and I highly recommend taking his class. He's very passionate about what he does and does a good job at conveying it. Tests are easy if you go to lecture and for both classes I took there were no book. Hes extremely helpful and doesn't like to see students fail. Also hes very objective adn no essays or papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology	449	4	5	5	2	1045868	10/24/08	Really great teacher! He definitely makes sure we understand what he is saying and makes the material funny. Has a bit of a potty mouth which is amusing :) Fair and easy tests if you study and do the reading too. Overall great teacher and class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Harnish	3.6	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	1045868	10/30/07	He is absolutely great! he uses powerpoint presentations for his lectures.He uses lots of pictures and videos and that keeps you awake.He's really helpful and nice to students.He always answers questions accurately and uses personal examples to explain things.He is a great teacher for intro to psych!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	574217	4/25/11	TERRIBLE TEACHER! Can't teach at all and you can barely understand him through his labored breathing and his ums and ers. OLD AND HAS TENURE! Run away! My class of 60 ended as a class of 12 (no lie) I dropped week three, my friends followed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	2	574217	2/1/10	First of all, a really sweet and approachable man. Always willing to help, but rarely can. All notes are online and those are clear enough. Listening in class may hurt you more than help. Allows a lot of make up credit for tests and quizzes. All of the homework is online and fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	204	1	2	1	1	574217	10/22/09	WORST PROFESSOR EVER. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	1	Mathematics	204	2	3	2	1	574217	10/1/09	I should have read the ratings. It is the same as most other people's comments. He doesn't follow his schedule, skips around chapters, and gives out unexpected quizzes. Half of the time, he makes mistakes when he's teaching the class. We never use the textbooks in the course either, which doesn't help. He needs to retire.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	2	Mathematics	204	4	5	5	3	574217	5/16/09	He is just the sweetest person ever!!!! he explains really good and is helpful outside of class!!! there are bad reviews for him because students simply don't understand math! take him if you get the chance!!! I got an A :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	574217	2/27/08	He loves teaching and math, but there comes a point where it is better for society if you just call the quits. Much too old and incoherent to be teaching. Does not follow syllabus at all, puts surprise material on tests that was not forewarned, and constantly makes mistakes while 'teaching'. Unless you already know the material DO NOT TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	2	574217	2/7/08	Overall, he is a very nice guy. He's also pretty flexible when it comes to grading as long as you come to class and don't sleep. Unfortunately, he can't teach. At all. I was confused the enitre quarter. He gets confused when he's teaching. Often, students correct him during class. Nice guy, but probably needs to retire.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	101	3	1	1	1	574217	6/22/07	I thought I would do fairly well in this class, but it was aweful. Prof. Hart is wayyy too old to be teaching...he's basically incomprehensible. He skips all over the place--assignes and grades homework before he teaches the material<<that sucked. Possibly the worst prof. Ive ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	574217	3/11/06	YO..DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM TEACHING!!!!!YOu will seriously regret it. He has no clue wat hes doing. He constantly making mistakes and his teaching style just sucks. The only way to pass this class is to learn from the book cuz the teacher will not help you what so ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	4	574217	2/8/06	RUN AWAY FAST, Do not under any circumstances take this class if at all possible. He is a retired engineer who decided to go into teaching, well he cant! Makes mistakes constantly, no organization skills, skips all over the place, and is unable to present material in a way you can understand it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	574217	1/12/11	This guy is just a senile old fart that needs to retire. He's completely incompetent and inept. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS! I seriously can't understand why he's still a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	574217	11/30/09	Good Guy...REALLY BAD Teacher. He would try to help but it never really worked. Students would correct simple and big mistakes made by him during class. He is getting old and seemed a bit senile.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	574217	10/21/09	It seems as though Professor Hart really tries, unfortunately he is just horrible at teaching. He spends 2 hours lecturing based on slides, this doesn't aid in the learning process because he is completely incomprehensible. He often adds material to the tests that has not properly been covered and assigns copious amounts of homework. Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	204	2	1	1	3	574217	9/24/09	Please AVOID this professor...every comment on board is very true. I'm taking his class now and if i could have avoided him, I would have but he was the only one teaching the evening course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	204	2	1	1	3	574217	1/27/09	HEED THESE WARNINGS! This man cant teach to save his life. He will start reviewing a test with I cant believe you guys got this wrong, and do it on the board himself and stare at his answer wondering why its wrong. 10 minutes later students will point out several mistakes. This professor will make your course 1000 times harder
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	1	Mathematics		2	4	2	3	574217	2/11/08	It is difficult to learn in class and he is very confusing , everyone ends up lost; if you come for an hour of extra help, however, you get everything figured out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	4	574217	10/24/07	Restating the same words louder does not help students understand. Managed to take my interest in taking additional math for my degree and turn it into not wanting to take another math class again. Only reason I did as well as I did, is because my wife is great at statistics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	204	3	2	2	3	574217	11/11/06	He's a nice guy, but he really shouldn't be teaching. Made mistakes on nearly every question through the quarter. Students had to correct him all the time. He made a lot of stuff far more difficult than it had to be. Doesn't check or grade homework, but do it anyway. And the book really sucks, doesn't explain things well either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	574217	2/16/06	ths professor was late, unprepared, unable to hear our questions, unable to answer our questions. this professor was unable to correctly answer his own math problems on the board without the class correcting several mistakes. this course was SELF tought. and SELF learned. the professor make each class harder and more confusing. this professor w
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics	200	3	2	1	1	574217	1/24/06	This professor is all over the place. Does not follow his syllabus, teaches things two weeks ahead of schedule so you can't keep up. Makes a ton of mistakes himself, should not be teaching college level.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	3	574217	11/28/05	If you have trouble with math, do not take his class since he does not explain things well. Otherwise, it is fairly easy since he always allowed test-corrections.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	1	574217	10/12/05	dudes an idoit sucks at math and is confusing as all hell pray your good at math or he will mess you up
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	3	574217	4/12/05	flexable with grades but he makes a lot of mistakes on homework and on borad in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	1	574217	10/25/05	DO NOT TAKE HIS ALGEBRA CLASS!!! He is the most senile, clueless, and near retarded teacher I have ever had and probably in the world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		5	1	1	5	574217	9/30/05	Professor Hart has no social skills whatsoever. Anyone that has not had precalculus will struggle if they don't teach themselves.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Hart	1.6	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	4	574217	2/26/05	(for management sciences)This class was bad, thank god I took algebra in high school and just needed a refresher course, Hart cannot teach. He makes MANY stupid mistakes when trying to teach you the material, it's easier just to learn it from your book. He's nice and does TRY to be helpful though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	1	Psychology	111	3	3	3	5	894385	8/18/12	I had her for cognitive psych. she is very laid back. lectures are entertaining. she lets you use a cheat sheet for tests but there is ALOT of possible material to be covered. could be a bit more clear about her expectations for group projects and things like that. however i got an A in the class and really enjoyed it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology	443	3	5	4	3	894385	2/29/12	Seemed nice, answered questions, really helpful with problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	1	Psychology	101	3	4	2	4	894385	4/16/11	She's really not that bad. I had her for cog psych over the summer (two hours do days a week) and it wasn't THAT bad. I was reading these comments and it makes her seem horrible. You just have to ask if you don't understand anything. I went to almost all the classes, kind of studied a little, and got a B. Shes not THAT bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology		3	4	4	3	894385	8/17/10	Overall, I really liked this class. Dr. Hart's teaching style is very chill...which allows a student some room for mistakes (getting things in late). There really weren't that many assignments, and the tests were pretty easy. The group research project is super easy and MUCH better than having to write a research paper like in other psych classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		1	1	2	3	894385	4/26/09	Lazy. Always on her phone. Brings her kids to class. Inconsistent with her words. Isn't prompt. Not friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		4	1	2	3	894385	1/27/09	Shes not a bad teacher but she i boring. She is unclear about everything, will not tell u about test before u take them. She does let u use cheat sheets typed in any font which u use her slides. the tests are hard but not unmanageable or impossible. Lecture is extremely boring but she doesnt care if u sleep. over okay teacher. but try to aviod.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		3	1	3	4	894385	1/28/08	She acted as though she did not care about teaching, made multiple excuses for why papers were late and for absences. At the end of the quarter I had no idea what my grade was. She was also very bad at replying to e-mails. She was too relaxed about our class with her absences and lack of communication about grades and project requirements.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology	514	2	2	1	2	894385	8/2/07	Brought her kids to class and had them sit in the corner. Very distracted and uneven in her presentation of information. Said ummm and ahhh so much that I stopped paying attention. Returned tests and quizes late on a regular basis. I would not take another class in which she is the instructor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology		4	4	5	4	894385	1/31/07	Prof. Hart is a very laid back teacher. She is rather quiet, but she really relates to her students. All you need to do to pass her take home tests are take notes in class and write directly from them. She tends to not be the most punctual teacher, but that means she will let you slip in that respect. Overall, there are worse Psych profs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		3	2	1	2	894385	1/15/07	SHE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT WANT TO TEACH!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology	533	2	5	5	5	894385	5/2/12	She is a great teacher. I have taken her classes before. She makes the class interesting and easy to understand. Very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology	433	4	4	3	5	894385	10/5/11	I also don't get why people think shes so bad, her lecture are entertaining. She's nice and willing to explain anything if you ask, besides that shes nice and not that strict. She lets you have a cheat sheet for the test and the test is mostly lecture stuff. Overall there are way worse professors at RIT and I would take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		1	2	1	1	894385	2/8/11	Hart is probably a good person who is NOT cut out to be a professor. Her lectures are extremely unclear, she often makes mathematical errors during her lectures, and she is extremely unorganized. I'm never taking a course with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology	443	4	2	2	3	894385	8/8/10	I don't feel like I learned that much in this class that I didn't already know. She allows you to have a note sheet during exams, and the exams are made from the power point slides. She also isn't the most helpful prof... especially when it comes to explaining what to do for the group research project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology	210	2	2	1	2	894385	3/12/09	Seems like a nice person, but extremely unclear on assignments and due dates; overall her class was very confusing and unclear. Lacks the rigor a professor needs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology	443	3	4	4	2	894385	9/23/08	I wasn't expecting to enjoy cog psych, but it was actually pretty fun. Prof Hart seemed to know what she was talking about. I would take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		2	1	2	4	894385	11/6/07	She brought her kids into class on a few occasions. She was supremely unclear as to how the running project for the whole quarter was to be set up and gave no advice (including basics such as page length) unless asked. She constantly is 2-3 weeks late giving back tests and you never know how well you are doing in her class. Horrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		2	1	2	3	894385	5/14/07	Overall, a very bad professor. She obviously has other things that she would rather do than teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology		3	4	3	3	894385	1/17/07	She is a pretty good teacher, tries to connect with students, seems to really like teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		4	2	1	1	894385	1/15/07	Incompetent. She will fail you if you disagree with her liberal views.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology		1	1	1	1	894385	1/15/07	Does not grade fairly. Is not prompt at returning papers. Does not appear to be knowledgeable in the subject area.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	2	Psychology	210	4	4	4	4	894385	10/24/06	Teaches the course very effectively, and gives insight along with each topic. Good sense of humor and easy to talk to. Also very understanding of mitigating circumstances. Great professor overall, and one that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in Psychology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rhiannon Hart	2.6	0	Psychology	101	3	2	1	2	894385	11/13/06	Unclear in course outline/syllabus, inconsistent and arbitrary grading techniques, slow in grading, often unprepared and late did not give appropriate amount of time for preparation to have an effective class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Harvey	2.2	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	559798	10/24/05	Wow, the worst science experiment possible besides having your testicles disected while youa re awake. Seriously contemplate changing majors if you are forced to take a class taught by harvey.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Harvey	2.2	2	Physics	312	3	4	5	4	559798	1/22/05	sounds EXACTLY like the ladies man from snl. sorta funny; gets a little too excited about phyics (after deriving an equation: "isnt that beautiful?"). overall pretty good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Harvey	2.2	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	559798	5/19/05	He teaches NOTHING that he grades on, his grading policy is to destroy anyones GPA, and he makes no effort to help out a student who is in poor standing. If you are a physics major, he may be as psyched about physics as you are but for us humans he has ruined this science, avoid like the plague. Otherwise be repared to use another teachers notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		5	3	5	2	102777	2/29/12	Pretty easy going, i stopped going to lectures half way through the course because all the work is online and right out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	3	102777	11/28/11	He is deaf, however this does not affect the class very much. He is very intelligent and knows the material well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	0	Psychology		5	1	3	5	102777	12/1/09	He is excellent at teaching but is not invested in the course. He is completely useless outside of the lecture. But its an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	102777	11/8/05	Great teaacher, very excited to be teaaching and conveys material well. Very nice guy to interact with
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		5	5	5	4	102777	2/6/05	Truly great teacher! One of the best I've ever had!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		4	4	5	4	102777	1/12/05	Great teacher, makes class amusing. He is deaf but the 2 interperters for my class were wonderful. Tests are easy if you are good at memorization as he pulls all the questions from the practice booklet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		3	4	4	NULL	102777	3/12/04	Test was much harder than expected... interpreter sometimes hard to follow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		5	5	4	NULL	102777	2/18/03	A very good, and easy professor. You still learn.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		4	4	4	3	102777	2/4/12	Simple class to take to get rid of a behavior/social science lib arts. He has daily online quizzes from textbook chapters every week, get points for going to class, and just a essay to write with ample time to do. Easy A if you go to class and put effort in the quizzes. Great professor with great stories and passion for psychology
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology	201	1	5	5	2	102777	5/27/10	His lectures are entertaining. It's like watching television or reading a good book--you have fun and you still learn a lot that is relevant to life. I highly recommend him. He's HOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Hauser	4.1	2	Psychology		3	4	4	4	102777	1/28/06	With him being deaf with 2 interp. you do need to pay a little more attention than usual. He's quite smart and knows his stuff. He has some really interesting and funny stories and conveys material well. His tests are moderately difficult. Remember to get the practice book, it really helps alot since most of the questions are taken from it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	651766	2/27/12	One of the better SE professors. Very helpful. Presents a lot of information and lectures can be boring, but only tests on core principles. Projects are a lot of work but he is a fair grader. I have had him for many classes and take his classes whenever it works for my schedule.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	1	Engineering		4	3	2	4	651766	11/12/08	I agree with other comments - he presents A LOT of material. It is really hard to study for the class because of this. Also I feel as if I didn't really learn any of it. I drowned in a sea of information for a while and wound up with an OK grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	3	3	651766	8/7/06	This class was insane with tons of material to learn; it really should have been focused around a few central topics like most classes. It was a lot of work, but he was lenient with grades; he actually looked at the effort you put into something instead of just the result because he understood that. He's a great guy, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	2	Engineering	443	3	5	4	4	651766	11/18/09	Excellent professor. He presents a lot of material, but he only expects you to be able to understand the high-level concepts of what he has presented. Very helpful in and out of class with questions. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	2	Engineering	443	1	5	5	5	651766	10/27/08	Best professor and class at RIT by far. He presents A LOT of material to you, but only the core concepts will be on an exam. Activities are INCREDIBLY fun and help you learn. Projects are very flexible and interesting. He is one of those professors that I will take every chance possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	J. Scott Hawker	4.2	2	Engineering		5	5	5	2	651766	8/12/05	I had no interest in this class whatsoever but I ended up coming out learning a whole lot. Sometimes his lectures can be boring but for the most part he's not bad. Easy tests. Easy grader. Nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Heberlig	4.3	2	Philosophy	512	5	5	5	3	1078551	4/28/08	good guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Heberlig	4.3	2	Philosophy	101	5	5	4	4	1078551	12/18/07	Great Professor, you can see the wheels turning in his head as he thinks. He knows his stuff, this is a lecture class but you can ask as many questions as you want. I missed most of the classes including a HUGE test and he was really good about it! Take his class if you can, he has a realistic stance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nathan Heberlig	4.3	2	Philosophy	210	5	3	4	5	1078551	4/10/08	He is a really easy professor.He lectures and it helps to take note of everything he says.Before each test he gives the exact question and summarises the answers so attendance on those days are most important.All you have to do is memorise the summary.I got a 100 in all my tests!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Heintz	1.5	0	Information Technology		5	1	2	4	1633125	12/5/11	I did not learn a single thing in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Heintz	1.5	0	Information Technology		5	1	2	5	1633125	10/29/11	Absolutely useless professor. Teaches only by showing youtube video examples of the next project you will do, and says nothing of how to do it. Although this class is a really easy A if you know anything at all about drawing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	3	294749	6/1/11	Best Drawing teacher ever! I had him for 3 quarters freshman year. He grades hard but helps you get better. I actually wanted to get up for drawing at 9. Take the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	294749	11/16/07	I LOVE BOB! Funny sense of humor. Go to class, you have a lot to learn from him. So much experience and ALWAYS helping everyone improve. May be a hard grader at times, (not as hard as Clif I would imagine), but you can re-submit work for a better grade all quarter. It's easy to get an A if you work hard. TAKE HIS CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	1	Fine Arts		2	4	2	5	294749	4/28/06	Bob's a great teacher who really improves your drawing ability. It still astounds me to see the progress that I made from just a single semester with him. Projects are due ever other week though, which makes you really have to focus on what you're doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	4	294749	9/2/05	my work from this class wound up being some of the strongest pieces in my portfolio, but bob is a rude and odd little man. our personalities clashed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	294749	8/31/05	Best art teacher I have ever had or even heard of. Tough, but well worth it... A's are not thrown around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	NULL	294749	8/7/04	best teacher ever. learned a lot from his class and had a lot of fun in it too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	4	294749	10/4/08	Omg i <3 Bob. He's a fun teacher, he likes to make a connection with each individual student so you always have an inside joke going. The class is a lot of fun and I learned a lot from him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	294749	10/30/05	awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	294749	9/2/05	Bob Rocks! He gave me this kick ass Willie Nelson t-shirt from 1987. Did you know he used to be a truck driver?? I LOVE THE BOB!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	294749	8/26/05	a man a few words. Always lending helpful Idea's and helps push boundries beyond mediocrice. This whole school Teaches you the truth about an art career. You need to do above and beyond EVERYONE to be a success.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Heishmann	4.3	2	Fine Arts	101	2	4	4	NULL	294749	11/21/03	He is a really awesome teacher. You learn a lot.. although if you are a perfectionist (when it comes to drawing) this class's homework assignments will consume all your time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Helfrich	2.0	2	History		3	4	4	4	1416603	10/31/10	Great teacher, don't expect an easy A. Lots of papers, but he's helpful outside of class. Don't waste your time complaining about the class. It's college!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Helfrich	2.0	0	History	101	2	2	2	3	1416603	4/26/10	Classes are pointless since he goes over information that isn't even relevant to the essays which are your only source of grades in the class. Also, the essays are vague and difficult. Nice guy but do not recommend him as a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Helfrich	2.0	0	History		1	1	1	1	1416603	3/12/10	Nice guy, awful teacher. He will make you write 8 to 10 pages every week and get no credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Helfrich	2.0	0	History		2	1	2	3	1416603	5/25/10	I would never recommend this teacher. The classes are horribly dull as all they consist only of him reading from he book the entire time. The lecture information usually has nothing at all to do with your papers, and there are only 3, hard and obscure essays to write for the class at the end of the quarter to be graded on. I learned nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Helfrich	2.0	0	History		1	1	2	1	1416603	3/19/10	Depressing class. Wow, I pity him big time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edith Hemaspaandra	3.6	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	3	1429919	4/2/12	Not bad....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edith Hemaspaandra	3.6	0	Computer Science	700	1	2	2	5	1429919	11/21/10	Great person, really cares about the students but not really a good teacher when it comes to teaching. She took 5 weeks to finish chapter 1 but finished 6 chapters in rest 5 weeks. In midterm, the class average was 72 and in final 42 out of 64 students got less than 75. That explains a lot about how difficult her teaching and grading can be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edith Hemaspaandra	3.6	2	Computer Science	700	3	5	4	4	1429919	10/1/10	Great Professor. Try to solve and discuss solutions. Quizzes are easy but it needs consistent study. Overall very good teaching experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edith Hemaspaandra	3.6	2	Computer Science	481	4	5	5	5	1429919	3/19/11	great prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edith Hemaspaandra	3.6	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	4	1429919	11/20/10	awesome teacher !!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology		4	3	5	4	828850	2/24/13	Tona is great person, and her lectures are never boring. She's strict with deadlines and html validation, but she makes her expectations very clear. Just follow her instructions, and you'll do fine in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	295	5	5	5	5	828850	12/12/11	Tona is extremely helpful and knows the material well. You will learn a lot from her if you want to. She's very interesting, and doesn't want to bore the class either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	1	Information Technology		5	2	4	5	828850	10/22/08	I was excited for this class, mainly for web development and Unix. I must say I was disappointed. We don't learn much in the ways of CSS, but we learn how to (basically) google for the answer. Also, we used iframes...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	4	4	828850	12/3/07	She is a good professor, she knows the structure and teaching of good begining web design and that transition to XHTML 1.0. I do think she left some of the non-IT students in the dust early in the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	1	Information Technology	320	3	3	3	2	828850	2/20/07	She wont give an A on any assignments unless you do extra work. Unfair grading sometimes. Decent professor, but wouldnt be my first choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	3	828850	5/3/06	Quite an easy class. Likes to play music before class. Her directions for class work isn't always clear, but great at helping clearing things up. Rather eccentric, but fun. Overall, I say this is a very easy class seeing how I came in with 0 html/css and photoshop/fireworks knowledge and am still getting an 'A'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology		2	5	5	3	828850	5/22/12	Good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	5	828850	5/10/10	The class was easy, the teacher made it fun, and despite being a rather simplistic class, I still enjoyed it and learned a decent amount of stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	3	828850	3/30/08	Tona does tend to smoke the non-IT students, but I feel the new media students should have to learn it anyways. FTP, and Unix file permissions are NOT THAT DIFFICULT. Doing a little extra for an A is no big deal, it's as simple as using XHTML 1.0 Strict instead of transitional. Learn by using internet resources instead of books.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	0	Information Technology		5	1	1	4	828850	8/23/07	Possibly one of the worst teachers I've ever had. Didn't learn a thing. If you need an A though, take her class. No design sense at all and possibly the most pointless class I've ever taken in my life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tona Henderson	3.8	0	Information Technology	320	2	2	2	3	828850	11/14/06	She teaches to people like they already know the information. She teaches to IT students, but when your not an IT student you get completely lost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		4	5	5	5	480159	2/28/13	I took with him two classes and I really enjoyed them. He is very nice guy who cares about his students. He assigns bunch of books that are not really relevant to most of the lectures. Tests are essays and if you take good notes during the lecture, you will do well. If you want an easy liberal arts class, take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		4	3	4	3	480159	3/13/12	A great guy and a great teacher. Lectures are semi boring but you learn a lot. He doesn't take attendance so if ur smart in history you do not need to show up a lot. Books he assigns are a little lengthy but turns out i hardly used them. Two test and a final. He will tell your whats on the test so go to the class before it. Easy A or B
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History	301	4	5	5	3	480159	3/2/12	Nice guy, wants to help. The only grades are essay tests. For a history class it lacks discussion, but a good choice for a liberal arts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History	101	3	4	4	2	480159	8/9/11	The work load assigned is not small but not impossible. He is a fair grader and an understanding professor. History can be dry but you will learn a lot from him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		4	5	4	4	480159	11/19/10	Great professor. Can be boring at times, but is usually quite interesting; ask him about his trips to Japan. Fair grader, doesn't care much if you miss a few classes. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History	301	5	4	4	4	480159	2/26/09	He's a pretty cool the guy, the class is pretty easy as long as you take notes. He tells you exactly what is on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		2	3	4	2	480159	3/6/06	If you cant write well, dont take him. I got C's on all of my papers. Somewhat hard of a paper grader, I thought they all deserved B's. Boring lecturer. Assigns too much reading and gets behind in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		3	5	5	4	480159	11/11/05	Prof. Henning gives out three papers (7-10 pages) for one quarter. No final is necessary. He lectures clearly, so you can take good notes. You will probably use them for the papers. the reading is not necessary for class but definately for the papers! Class discussion gets you credit. I'd definately take him again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		5	5	5	4	480159	2/7/05	Easy teacher, class is a bit boring sometimes but he explains everything, you're aware of what is on each test and papers aren't so bad. I had an A without working too hard. I'd take him again. He's a great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		5	5	5	4	480159	10/27/04	Great teacher! He's new, but he knows what he is doing. Fair tests, very smart.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		3	4	4	2	480159	1/31/13	Good teacher. Uses in class essay tests for your grade. Usually lectures but also shows movies to supplement. If you go to class you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		4	3	5	3	480159	3/6/12	Good choice for a mandatory liberal arts class. As said before, the only tests are essays. I found it incredibly hard to stay focused/awake in class or even get to class in general because its pretty boring. He's a super nice guy though. As a hint, be sure to go to the class before a test because he tells you what's going to be on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History	301	5	2	3	2	480159	2/1/12	Very easy! Very boring! This class made me fall asleep every time. Tests are just essays, and you don't need to do the readings as long as you pay attention a little bit in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History		5	3	3	4	480159	2/2/11	Very boring professor, but extremely nice. Will go out of his way to answer questions...and a fairly easy essay grader. Would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History	301	1	3	3	3	480159	10/24/10	The course was 100% lecture and the only grade is 3 in class exams each consisting of 2 essays. There is no other work, so bad essay writers beware. Fe also requires an insane amount of reading, but none of the books are actually textbook style books. You will have nothing to study from but your class notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History		5	1	4	1	480159	2/19/09	He was one of the worst in my entire college career. ranks in the top 2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History		4	3	3	3	480159	1/31/06	He assigns 3 papers over the course. No tests, quizzes, midterm or final. Lecutres are sometimes boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	1	History		3	3	2	3	480159	9/19/05	He assigns so much reading and you can barley keep up with. Meanwhile he is about 4 days behind the reaading he assigns for class and more then 100 years behind in where a assigned paper wants us to be
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Henning	3.9	2	History		4	4	5	1	480159	10/27/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	2	History	101	3	5	5	4	573221	12/14/12	At bergen. he's cool and does curve test depending how bad they are. he's clear about what he wants. responds quickly. he is a fair grader, lets you redo for a better grade. Take him. Not a class for slackers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	2	History		2	4	5	4	573221	10/13/11	He's a funny guy, he keeps the class interesting, and he's very fair. There's a few hard tests but they curve up according to how everyone does. There's also a paper worth 50% of your grade. It's a hard class, but you'll learn a ton! I'd definitely recommend him as a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	1	History	301	2	2	4	1	573221	4/11/05	He's an interesting teacher, but his grading policies are impossible to satisfy. He gives a one question quiz everyday on 20-30 pages worth of reading on a single obscure detail. You either get 1/1 or 0/1. At the end of the quarter these hit-or-miss quizzes count for 25% of your total grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	2	History	301	4	5	5	3	573221	5/9/12	Very friendly and intelligent. Brings a positive 'energy' to the classroom. Actually makes history interesting. Shows relevant vidoes in class. Tests are not too bad and are curved. Definitely recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	2	History		1	5	5	5	573221	10/5/05	Awesome guy, he is real T-U-F-F. But he's everything that you should want in a college professor, and he really cares about his students. Comes to school on sundays before tests and has study groups for students who are struggling
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Hering	4.4	2	History	301	3	4	4	3	573221	2/23/05	He was a good teacher. Kept you interested in the class by telling stories about history that were not in the textbook. He also showed movies and clips of films related to the topics discussed. He gives 4 Multiple Choice Tests and a paper. For the tests make sure you do the reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	2	Spanish		5	4	5	4	1348215	3/17/13	I took Spanish in high school and did not understand the subjunctive at all, I was concerned about this topic, but Professor Haumann did a great job helping us understand it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	2	Spanish		4	4	4	3	1348215	11/1/12	I had personal issues and professor Haumann was very accomodating.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	0	Spanish		2	1	2	3	1348215	4/21/11	Seriously do not take haumann- she will make you hate spanish. For the hw she makes you copy the directions from the book so she doesn't have to get a book herself. She is not nice when you get answers wrong and does not clarify. Worst class in a long time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	1	Spanish	562	3	3	3	5	1348215	11/16/09	Assigns lot of homework EVERY DAY, that helps to prepare for the tests, however sometimes we are just overloaded with homework. Tests are easy, but she deducts whole points on minor things which is unfair
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	2	Spanish		5	5	5	5	1348215	1/2/13	Professor is very knowledgeable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	2	Spanish	522	5	4	4	4	1348215	2/17/12	I had a lot of fun in her class. She had great in class activities.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Diana Haumann	3.3	0	Spanish	360	2	1	1	1	1348215	2/9/10	Assigns more homework then necessary. Very tuff Grader. I took four years of Spanish and will be lucky to get a B (even though I have done the work and put the time in). Please look into another professor for language classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Haven	1.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	2	1203177	11/11/08	Assignments seem dull at times and isn't clear during critiques. Grades are randomly placed and really have no meaning. Some days are fine others are not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	4	13095	1/28/13	He knows C++ and expects you to know it too. If you have a general understanding you will do okay. His tests aren't the easiest but he curves a little. Asking him for help results in him either making you wish you didn't ask or becoming more confused.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	13095	11/16/12	Matt Healy is the best teacher I've had for the CS intro sequence. His knowledge of C++ is incredible, to the point where he's able to field---and maybe even expecting---any question about the language, no matter how complex or obscure. To top it all off, he's an excellent lecturer with a very interactive approach to demonstrations. Take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	1	13095	5/6/10	When you are relatively new to programming, it is difficult to understand why healy would expect you to write code as if you had been in the industry for 20 years. Beware of this teach... person who tries to teach. He will insult you, trod on you, make you feel like trash, and then give you a poor grade no matter what. BEWARE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		1	4	4	3	13095	10/30/09	Matt is quite a character. His lectures are corny and funny, he is the most interesting CS teacher I've had. He is a tough grader and expects you to know your stuff. If your an easy going student you wont have a problem, but i dont recommend asking about your grade on anything, he can be a little moody. he knows his stuff. Overall hes a good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science	233	1	2	4	4	13095	9/22/09	A part-time teacher, works parttime or fulltime in the software biz, and has two kids thus his grading seems rushed/harsh/mostly uncommented, and his hours are limited. He's not boring cause most of the time he's in someone's face waiting for them to give a wrong answer. If you must take him, make sure you know other people who know your class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	13095	5/14/09	Matt keeps class fun and entertaining. He really knows his stuff. But he's a pretty hard grader and if you ask him for help one-on-one he's pretty harsh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	13095	8/19/08	Wow the other ratings are all wrong. He is the 2nd best cs prof. I have had so far. As a hint, the good cs prof's always wear shorts/sandals, thr great ones take off the sandals while teaching. (Phill White does too, and he's the best)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science		1	2	3	4	13095	3/9/08	Very strict grader, knocks off points for everything he possibly can. Tests pretty hard. not a professor, hes a guy with a job that teaches at night for some extra bucks. avoid if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science	233	4	5	5	5	13095	12/5/06	Matt is a really good teacher. It's true that he can be a hard grader, but he also makes sure you know what's going on in the class, considering what you're learning will be used throughout the rest of your degree. He can be pretty funny and is willing to help you as long as you if you need further assistance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		1	4	4	4	13095	4/27/06	Matt is a great professor, but is an amazingly hard grader. You'll learn a lot in his class, but you'll need to work your a** off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	13095	1/25/13	If you're on top of things with comp sci he's a great choice. The assignments are going to be the same as any other CS4 class. The difference is that in lecture he'll describe things more technically than other professors. He knows his stuff. To keep up with the explanations you'll want to read the textbook for sure, you'll get a lot out of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	13095	3/3/11	This guy is a moron for a teacher. He may be smart in the industry but he is a joke of a teacher. Expects you to know everything & was very unhelpful. Avoid taking any core cs classes unless you know the topic beforehand. Ps he's obese, smelly and often does not wear shoes or socks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science	263	1	1	4	3	13095	11/12/09	VERY rude at times. Makes you not want to go see him for help cuz he always makes you feel dumb and doesn't seem to care. Strict grader, expects you to remember every slide in the powerpoint for an exam, even if he spent 5 min explaining a topic. Every time he helped me outside of lecture he was very rude. He also thinks he's funny but he isn't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science	334	1	2	4	3	13095	10/1/09	Harshest grader I've had yet, and is a "jerk" (replace that with a 'curse' word). Don't take this guy, he'll deduct points from anything just for fun. Plus he's the kind of person who tries very hard to be funny, and never comes close. Not the funny kind either, the annoying like, "please shut up," kind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science	334	2	5	5	4	13095	5/29/09	Adjunct, but definitely knows the material (CS4). A good teacher for somebody who's interested in a more in-depth coverage (office hours good too). Bad for people that don't like to pretend they're a block of memory as a concept illustration.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science	233	3	5	5	5	13095	8/20/08	Healy is a no-nonsense, hilarious professor; class is never a bore. He tends to grade strictly, emphasizing efficiency, but he is fair. Though he may be tough, when you complete his class you will have learned a lot and will be much better prepared for upcoming CS classes. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone who wants to work and succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science		1	2	3	4	13095	4/14/08	TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!! He is very knowledgable in Computer Science and C++ but he is rediculously harsh. Very quick to take off points without even looking at content. Often interrupts when you ask a question and provides an unrelated answer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	4	13095	1/12/07	Not the easiest teacher, but he knows how to get you to understand material with little out of class work on your part. He says "um..." REALLY REALLY LOUDLY whenever he's between thoughts. Knows his stuff, if your projects follow the directions, you'll ace the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	3	3	13095	11/16/06	A very harsh grader. He will not go easy on you. His classes do not cover everything that is on the test. DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science		3	2	4	5	13095	10/18/05	An ok guy, funny but seemed to get confused at a lot of questions. Gets a lot of things wrong on tests and has to correct them, but still grades pretty harsh. Not terrible, but not too great either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	5	13095	5/19/05	Hard grader, hard tests, but if you are serious about being a CS major, and actually accomplishing things that are ona higher standard that a chat program this is the guy to take. He knows his stuff, he makes a seriously large effort to be available even though he is a part time teacher. Very Very good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science	101	2	2	3	NULL	13095	6/21/04	generally puts down creativity...wants to educate and produce code trolls rather than talented, inspired programmers who might go on to do something useful with their careers. Does he still do Rocky @ Ridgeway Sat nights?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	NULL	13095	4/27/04	Okay, you can pretty much never go to his class if you want, he has all his slides on his website, and it's more or less all you need to know. The guy knows his stuff, but is pretty poor at conveying it. And if you ask him for help, he is pretty derisiv

Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	13095	10/22/04	Matt is admittedly a very hard grader. He tends to grade projects no just on correctness, but also efficiency. Certainly not the professor to take if you're a mediocre CS student, but if you're generally interested in CS, he's the guy to have because he puts everything into a real world perspecive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	1	Computer Science		2	3	2	NULL	13095	5/4/04	This guy is the hardest grader i've ever seen. I submitted a working project and I still ended up with a D. Go Figure.. Very hard grader on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	NULL	13095	3/24/04	This guy should be avoided at all times.He is making extra money talking in his own world and teaching few puppets, ignoring the rest willful students, who are paying $$$ to see his hedious face twice a week. Avoid!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science	210	1	1	1	NULL	13095	2/17/03	Avoid like the plague!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Healy	3.0	0	Computer Science	700	1	1	1	NULL	13095	8/17/01	learned comp. science and now taking revenge from humans. be advised.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara Heifferon	3.0	0	English		1	1	2	4	1407107	10/19/11	Avoid if possible, she is an unreasonable woman who will give mean comments (tell you that you are a terrible writer and question your writing background) on your papers which are not constructive to your growth as a writer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design	231	4	5	3	1	236361	12/6/11	I had Denise for 2 quarters of 2D and she was excellent. MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER 2D profs. She's really helpful and considerate. Her classes are really laid back, a good way to start the day. You learn a lot but get so much class time to work you don't have to do much outside of class. Shes really sweet and one of the best teachers in CIAS. Take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		4	4	4	5	236361	3/8/10	I loved her class. You get to fix your assignments even after the due dates to get better grades. She's very nice and if you have any problems with your work, talk to her, she will help you out
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		4	4	4	4	236361	1/31/10	Denise is a very nice lady. I would definitely recommend her foundations classes. If you do the work and hand drawings in on time, you will be fine. Her workload is very reasonable as well. I loved the laid-back atmosphere of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design	212	3	5	5	5	236361	2/9/07	Denise is very nice and helpful. As long as you do your work and come to class (and participate) you will get an okay grade. The more you seem interested and ask her opinion on your work and then revise it the better a grade you will get. At first she seemed kind of boring, but as long as you don't slack off you will probably end up liking her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		3	3	5	5	236361	9/11/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		4	5	5	2	236361	1/31/05	The best drawing teacher, by far. Her classes are very laid back. I would go and get a cup of coffee, pop on my headphones and draw away. Shes very helpful and she really pays no attention to anything but the person she is helping out. It is easy to leave, wander, or do nothing. Fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	0	Design		2	2	2	4	236361	11/14/11	Incredibly vague, not interesting and every class felt unproductive and I thought it would never end
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		4	4	5	3	236361	2/4/10	She is really sweet and completely reasonable about deadlines. Her foundations drawing class is pretty easy as long as you listen to her and do the work! I enjoyed her class and would take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	1	Design	231	1	3	3	2	236361	5/31/07	Got sidetracked easily and wasnt really clear on the assignments. Then would criticize your lack of understanding over and over in critiques. Droned on for a while while she was talking. Didnt grade assignments until last class. Hated this class and the professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		3	5	4	3	236361	12/13/06	Her drawing class was a lot of fun. She was very helpful, and we only had outside assignments due every 2 weeks. Very nice to work with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	2	Design		3	5	4	3	236361	2/10/05	she really knows what she's talking about, one the best drawing teachers I've ever had! She can see your work and tell you exactly what's wrong with it, and her critiscm is always very constructive
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Heishmann	3.8	0	Design		1	1	1	1	236361	11/27/04	Doesn't teach what to do, just assigns work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	3	389266	4/1/13	This professor came with a good recommendation, and I can't figure out why. He's kind of sassy if he thinks your not asking the right questions. He also will tell you to get lost and ask the question on the class forum online. His work isn't hard once you figure out what it is he's asking you for and that's the key. I say he's a so so professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science	450	3	5	4	5	389266	11/2/11	I wrote the 10/11/11 review, and we're now on week 9. Heliotis teaches the concepts very well, but his tests are certainly "gotchas" if you aren't careful. If some detail is simple he might only go over it once, even if in practice that simple thing is very important (and it might be on the tests!) But again, he is friendly and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science	243	3	5	3	4	389266	5/8/11	Cool guy, will definitely try to help you if you ask him question. Will be available to meet with you even if it is outside his office hours. Lecture can be confusing sometime but that's CS guys...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	1	Computer Science	242	3	4	2	4	389266	5/22/10	HE knows what he's doing, but be for warned. He grades with no method that makes sense. Is approachable though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science	243	3	4	4	5	389266	2/10/10	Prof Heliotis is a cool guy. He teaches fairly well ad he knows his stuff. He is very lenient in class, accommodating of students, and available for extra help. The only downside is that his exams are a little tough, but assuming that you are a good student you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	5	389266	10/20/08	Awesome teacher, easiest class ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	1	Computer Science	380	2	3	3	3	389266	11/5/07	I did not like his style. About half way through the quarter, as over half the class had a failing average, he retorts: "When selecting problems, I didn't want to make them too easy." Granted it was CS Theory which is a notorious class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	5	389266	11/25/06	i don't know WHAT these ppl are talking about, but i love heliotis (i've taken 3 of his classes). he has a really dry, funny sense of humor. of course if you don't like dry humor, you might not think he's funny. but otherwise, his test/assignments are very reasonable (not hard or easy), and he knows what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	4	389266	11/19/05	His teaching style is extremely boring. He's usually unavailable for help, so trying to ask for questions after class is useless. Best to avoid him at all cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	389266	10/14/05	Good professor, highly recommended for early courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	3	389266	1/31/12	For CS2 he told us to use the textbook. Then he didn't teach at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science	450	3	5	5	4	389266	10/11/11	So I'm on week 6, and just got the first exam back. It wasn't easy, but then it wasn't outrageous, either. I didn't study, but I learned enough from doing the labs and attending class to get a 90%. Just give exams your all. Class itself is a breeze, and Prof. Heliotis is very friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	1	Computer Science	242	2	3	3	5	389266	2/2/11	Fun guy, definitely knows his stuff. He's very approachable and is fairly good at answering specific questions. His lectures can be confusing so be prepared to learn a lot on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		1	3	4	5	389266	4/6/10	Funny and nice guy in person. He knows his stuff and is a good teacher. Unfortunately, his grading is unfair and brutal, taking points off for things that he would say not to worry about. The class average for our final was in the upper 50's if i remember correctly, and this wasn't the first time that the averages were low. He got me my first B
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	1	Computer Science	450	1	3	3	4	389266	12/4/09	Not a bad professor, but when it comes to grading he takes you to the butcher shop. His tests are single-handedly the worst tests I've ever taken. Not only were they hard, but downright poppycock considering their ambiguities. The class average on the midterm was a 60, and he barely made an attempt to curve the class. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	1	Computer Science		2	3	2	2	389266	3/9/08	Nice guy, but tries too hard to "challenge" students. Likes to do things the hardest way possible. Has trouble explaining things to normal human beings. Overall nice guy though!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	389266	9/18/07	Everyone complaining about how hard this guy is either isn't smart as they think they are or is simply lazy. The tests were challenging, but not impossible. The class was interesting and as has been pointed out, he has a sense of humor that keeps your attention. And for PLC the projects + languages were good choices
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science	233	4	4	3	4	389266	9/20/06	Heliotis is a good teacher, some reviews are unfair. He is hard to follow at times because he assumes background material is known but it is easy to pick up from context. Tests harder than most professors, partial credit is given for close answers Unique sense of humor, good guy, very helpful in office hours when looking at code or concepts
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	389266	10/18/05	Real CS majors love this guy, only IT/SE majors don't seem to like him from what I've seen. He assumes you can program if you're in an upper level class, which seemed to anger some grad students from other programs. An awesome guy, not a pushover, but fun and smart.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		1	2	1	1	389266	8/12/05	This guy is a psycho. His tests are unreasonably hard with no room for argument, and when I found an easier way to do one of the projects than what "he thought was the best way," I got points off for being smarter than him. If you want better than a C in this class...take it with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		2	2	1	4	389266	8/12/05	Horrible Class. Horrible Teacher. Don't take it unless you want a C. That's the best you'll get. I would rather gouge my eyes out with a pencil than take this class (with him) again...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	NULL	389266	5/6/04	Great professor. Very knowledgable on his subject and can help you greatly if you pursue the knowledge. Go Heliotis.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	0	Computer Science		1	3	1	NULL	389266	4/19/04	This guy is nuts. Picture this: teach programming and correcting syntax errors on your slides in class. Tests suck. Projects suck. Hard class. Hard prof. Nuf' said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	NULL	389266	5/12/04	The class is easy. Test are kind of strange but he grades so easy on them and gives points where he really shouldn't. Plus many small projects that are really simple.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Heliotis	3.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	3	NULL	389266	5/5/04	This guy's pretty cool. He knows what he's talking about, which is why he's the project coordinator and main guy in the CS department. Tests are reasonably difficult, but he tells you everything that will be on it beforehand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorraine Hems	4.7	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	5	1477262	3/5/12	Hems is an amazing teacher and makes the class fun and interesting. WOW II is a little more advanced then WOW 1 and focuses more on the specifics but still introduces you to new things. Attendance is optional but you're own loss if you don't and drink the wine. midterm and final are only 45% which allows you to still do well overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorraine Hems	4.7	2	Hospitality		5	3	4	5	1477262	2/2/11	One of the best Hospitality professors in the department. Extremely fun, and will keep you laughing. Class is extremely easy as well!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorraine Hems	4.7	2	Hospitality		5	5	5	4	1477262	1/26/11	Great professor, extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter, you will learn A LOT about wine. Makes the class very enjoyable and something to look forward to every week. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorraine Hems	4.7	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	5	1477262	2/1/12	Lorraine is my favorite teacher that I have had. She is very knowledgeable and keeps you interested in the material. Very energetic and positive. Does not take attendance, but coming to class will help on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorraine Hems	4.7	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	4	1477262	1/26/11	took lorraine for wow 1, wow 2, and beverage fermentation and distillation
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	1	Criminal Justice		4	3	3	4	266998	2/7/08	He's a nice guy, his quizzes are straight off his slides and since you can have open notes/book, they're not difficult. He also remands his quizzes if students miss questions more than others. The class is very boring though, a 2 hour class turned into a 4 hour class and unless you live for computers this is not your class, little on crime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	266998	11/25/05	Good teacher. Was fair on the tests, like if lots of people would get a question wrong, he'd give everyone credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	266998	2/22/05	Excellent course. No midterm/final. 9 tests, once a week. Interesting lecture and very informative. Fun stories!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	0	Criminal Justice		3	2	1	4	266998	5/28/06	Your course grade consists of 9 tests, one per week. The tests are terrible. They are poorly written, unclear, and often subjective. Luckily, they are all open book/notes, and the questions are taken right off of the slides. I learned next to nothing in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	4	5	266998	10/20/05	awesome guy.. fun class... tells awesome police stories. easy A or B...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hennekey	3.5	1	Criminal Justice		3	3	2	NULL	266998	10/23/03	Badly written exams. Questions are only answered correctly if are reading them from his perspectives i.e. you must have many years of experience in the field computer criminal investigation under your belt. Too arrogant to admit many faults in his exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	0	Psychology		1	1	1	3	504077	1/17/13	worst teacher i ever had. When a teacher says i dont care what grade you get im the head of the department you know you have a bad teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		2	4	3	4	504077	9/17/08	I don't understand the neg comments- he's a good teacher. He gave interesting lectures but gets distracted easily (this is usually the fun part). Tests aren't easy, but are fair. Study everything he tell you too, including diagrams. Never had a problem with his essays. I enjoyed his class so much, I'm taking his Perception class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	0	Psychology	514	1	2	1	3	504077	8/19/06	I do not agree with the person who commented prior to me. I worked extremely hard in my class and still did not do well. I rewrote my research paper somewhere around ten times and turned it in over and over, his comments often contradicted what he said on earlier drafts. I wasn't slacking in his class at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	0	Psychology		1	2	2	4	504077	5/24/06	Never worked so hard for a "D" in my life. We had "informal" presentations which he sprung on us at the last minute. These were for each of us to just see what everyone else worked on, but then he graded them. Got really negative toward the end of the course, maybe he's having a life crisis or something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology	311	3	5	5	3	504077	3/22/06	good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	504077	9/6/05	Great teacher. Very interesting lectures, really sparks interest. Always willing to help students and work with them. Great professor!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		3	5	5	4	504077	12/3/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		1	4	4	4	504077	1/12/09	Very knowledgeable and efficient. Can answer most of your questions. Very hard professor though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		2	4	4	4	504077	1/4/07	HARD class but interesting class. Funny professor, but you def. have to work your butt off for a good grade. Hardest psych class I've taken
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		3	5	5	4	504077	7/22/06	I loved this class. He is very funny and i looked forward to coming to class. Grades extremely fair. Tests are from his notes and the book. It's not an easy course but he made sure we understood through his powerpoints and videos. I got a C ONLY because I slacked off. Dont slack off and you'll besure to get an A or B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		1	5	2	5	504077	5/17/06	Moody. Buries students under homework. One has to fight for a passing grade. Answering in class are never "quite" right. He has a great sense of humor, and I think he believes he is encouraging, but has the ability to make one simply stop trying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		3	5	4	1	504077	10/18/05	This prof is very helpful, and positive. He makes you feel like you can do it if you're having any problems. The lectures are really entertaining, he's very witty. The workload is pretty heavy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	504077	2/6/05	Great teacher. Really helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Herbert	3.8	2	Psychology		3	4	5	3	504077	11/18/04	Engaging presentations, good sense of humor, personable. I enjoyed the class and learned more than I expected to. I wish I had more classes like this. It wasn't easy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	0	Writing		5	1	1	4	348984	11/21/11	Don't take this class. She cancelled class 4 times and never informed us of our overall grades. Easy grade, but a useless course and waste of time/money.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing	502	4	5	4	4	348984	1/27/09	Really enthusiastic. Easy class that's also enjoyable. She is helpful and leniant as well. Recommended highly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing		4	4	5	5	348984	4/24/06	I thought the class was easy, the essays were not hard to do. Everything was very clear. No complaints at all. Hermsen is a good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing		5	4	4	4	348984	2/4/06	Easy, but she gets a bit upset when she asks a question that no one wants to answer. I think we literally stared at her for 5 minutes one time while she waited for a response.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing		4	5	5	4	348984	1/31/05	Writing & Lit 1 and 2. She was awesome! Write a couple papers with no real deadline. Get everything done by the end of the quarter and you'll be fine. She's a great professor, Highly recomended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing		4	4	4	5	348984	9/22/04	Write three papers outside of class, write journal entries and read selections in class. Nice and lenient.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	0	Writing	319	4	1	3	2	348984	8/18/09	What a flake! Had her for an online summer course and she was largely absent. Her directions were vague and she didn't even check the drafts we were required to hand in. Felt like a big waste of time. On the upside, it was easy to get an A without opening a textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing	155	4	5	5	3	348984	5/21/07	Hermsen grades in colors. Colors? Colors. My 1st paper got a grade of Lavender - which I think is good. My 2nd paper, about Bruno Latour, scored a Lime Green  not sure what that means, but since I dont like Latour I dont think its good. Final grade in the class: Mango. Seriously! My transcript says Engl 155, Grade: Mango!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	1	Writing		4	3	3	3	348984	2/26/06	She's really disorganized and doesn't respond to emails. She lost 2 of my papers, luckily i had them saved. She's a very easy grader so if you're looking for an easy class then take it with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	0	Writing		5	1	1	2	348984	8/31/05	Hermsen gives out A's so she doesn't have to hear fleck about her disorganized projects that have nothing to do with the cirriculum of a technical college. She's a broad-guage bore. If you really want to learn technical writing, find a different professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hermsen	3.5	2	Writing		5	5	5	2	348984	1/30/05	Had her for Writing & Lit, I & II. She's probably the nicest english prof on campus. Her class is really easy, just do the work (its minimal) and come to class prepared. If you get the chance, TAKE her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joyce  Hertzson	2.0	0	Design		4	2	2	4	1796910	2/8/13	Somewhere, deep down, Joyce knows what she's talking about when it comes to design. Unfortunately, it's covered up by her unclear instructions and easily distracted personality. Class is fairly easy, though, and she's really nice and always willing to accommodate you. But if you want to LEARN, try someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	351	3	4	4	3	649268	12/10/12	He really knows what he is talking about and is helpful. Pretty hard class if you have no networking experience though. He posted the lecture slides online but doesn't post under the grades tab
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology	101	4	2	2	4	649268	11/7/12	Overall, very easy class, but Hill is a bit stubborn as far as updating to modern times. Also, screwed me over with my grade. Don't recommend unless you have to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	5	4	5	5	649268	2/27/12	Larry Hill is a great professor. He makes the class easy and he doesn't take attendance. As long as you do the labs you should easily get an A in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	3	5	5	3	649268	10/25/11	Just make sure you take detailed notes (as he won't post the slides) and whatever you do, quote any answers you find on the net. He absolutely hates plagerism and cheating, and he will make your life at RIT absolutely horrible if he catches you (which happens a lot). Do your own work, pay attention and take notes. Grade: B+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	413	3	3	4	5	649268	7/23/11	He is omnipotent when it comes to the EE side of wireless, doesnt know too much on the Cisco side. TL;DR: Mishra is a ton better, He is in the middle, Yamin Al-Mousa dont ever take 413 wireless with him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	1	Information Technology		4	3	2	4	649268	11/2/10	Professor was decent. Had him for computer system fundamentals as well. Only problems I had with him were that he didn't post the slides. Also he had annoying online quizzes that everyone forgot because they were opened Friday & due by Saturday at midnight.He also included material from a previous course on the midterm, which was extremely annoying
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology	350	4	2	2	4	649268	4/20/10	Goes off on tangents and rarely comes back. You will not finish a lecture in 1 class. Loves to hear himself talk. If you disagree with him he will interrupt you and try to over power you to stop your argument.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	4	649268	2/16/10	Had him for Digital Fundamentals. Homework is always one lecture ahead of where you are. He is extremely unclear in class and sometimes doesn't even cover all the topics to be on the test. You must rely on reading the txt book instead. That being said the class itself is pretty easy and he is more helpful one on one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	403	3	4	3	4	649268	11/30/09	Good teacher, but you must hang onto every word in his lectures, else fail and exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology	205	3	1	2	2	649268	10/9/09	Truly a boring teacher. He could make you fall asleep in no time flat. Will not answer any e-mails and always tells story's from his paranoid computer use. I would avoid him if you could.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	3	649268	11/27/12	Way to strict
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	5	5	649268	4/26/12	Hill is the man. He comes off as strict at first, but he is actually really chill (he just has to lay down the law so that people don't use their phones in class and stuff like that because he won't put up with that). He knows everything about everything, and has really interesting stories (that go way off topic). Take any class you can with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	5	4	5	4	649268	10/27/11	Its an easy class. Prof. Hill is interesting to listen to. Take notes! He doesn't post notes online. Only issue I had with the class, is that he expects you to find answers to your homework online. Your notes don't help you much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology		4	3	5	5	649268	10/5/11	Professor Hill is pretty old school in terms of his teaching methods but he is a good teacher. He does not post slides so you have to take notes. He does rant about "The Cloud" a lot as well as various other topics. His TA's were good so it helped during labs. His midterms are online so its and easy A. Lab practical is closed notes so be prepared.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	4	4	5	4	649268	5/6/11	I strongly advise against taking him, at least for 350. I know that I will be avoiding him in the future. He spends the entire class time ranting about random things that annoy him that are either unrelated or barely related to class material.His rants actually frustrated me so much that I couldn't go to class. He treats his students like children.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	413	3	4	4	5	649268	5/18/10	Good professor overall. Most of the other ratings are accurate.. Likes to go on tangents and if you argue with him he will make you feel stupid in front of the whole class so you don't do it again. He also has a bad habit of picking graders for his labs that do not know the material, so check your graded work carefully for problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	413	4	5	4	5	649268	2/22/10	Had him for Wirless lecture and lab. Hes omnipotent when it comes to wireless- he knows it all. Fair grader but insanely hard MT/Final. Take him for wireless!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology	350	4	2	2	2	649268	2/1/10	While Larry is very well versed on the subject, he absolutely loves to hear himself speak. He often rants about things not appropriate either to the class or to a lecture setting (conspiracy theory much?) Long lectures are dull but the work isn't particularly difficult. Take another professor if available, or Hill if you don't have any other opt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	4	649268	10/19/09	Boring and worthless lectures. However, knowledgeable teacher, easy tests, easy labs, and fair grader. Do your labs and the little homework assigned and you'll ace the class easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	403	2	5	5	3	649268	1/30/09	I can only count the number of professors who have truly stimulated my intellect at RIT on a single hand, and Prof. Hill is one of them. This reminds me of why I go to college. Truly INSPIRING. I have almost never left a class thinking about the lectures for so long afterward.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	5	4	5	4	649268	11/12/08	This professor rocks. had him for Computer System Fundamentals. Lectures were very interesting, he kept my attention in every class. He has strict guidelines for the way he wants things done, but this is not a bad thing, as these guidelines basically tell you EXACTLY what you need to do to ace the course. Excellent prof. Highly recommended!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	342	3	5	5	3	649268	2/21/06	Professor Hill is a fountain of knowledge, can go off on tangents, but hey who doesnt like that. Very fair grader, and will help you out if you dont understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	0	Information Technology		5	2	2	2	649268	8/5/05	Knowledgable, However he will lecture for hours about students not following directions. The class seemed irrelevant at times. Final was on diagramming the parts of a CD-Rom Drive...why would ANYONE need to know how to take a part a cd drive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	5	649268	10/31/08	Knowledgeable, If you do the work you should get a B no problem. If something is unclear he will go over it. Nice guy to learn from
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Hill	3.5	2	Information Technology	342	4	5	4	5	649268	11/25/05	Very fair to his students when it came to grading and any problems that would come up. Knows a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mandell Hinda	5.0	2	Communication		3	5	5	4	1654106	2/28/12	She is AMAZING! Everything is clear in terms of expectations, she is flexible with changing deadlines and assignment requirements around if you state your case for the class logically and she encourages you to explore different programs to figure out what you like. She acknowledges questions in class and does a great job with class discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mandell Hinda	5.0	2	Communication	416	4	5	5	4	1654106	11/29/11	I took Newswriting class under Hinda in Fall 2011. She's a great teacher. Strict in typos, grammar, names spelling and datelines. But she's very clear-cut & I learned a lot from her. Her class is really fun & she invites guest speakers as part of our interview exercise. Overall, she's my favorite professor in the Communication department :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jameson Hirsch	4.6	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	5	913349	8/21/07	awesome teacher, super laid back, easy assignments, good sense of humor and interesting material, awesome guy all around
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jameson Hirsch	4.6	2	Psychology		3	3	5	5	913349	1/28/07	This guy is... Awesome. He is SO FUNNY and makes the class really interesting (as if Abby Psych wasn't interesting enough!) He always makes really funny jokes in relation to what you're studying. I definitely recommend him =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jameson Hirsch	4.6	2	Psychology	514	5	5	5	5	913349	11/8/06	he is a kind professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jameson Hirsch	4.6	2	Psychology	446	4	5	4	4	913349	4/24/07	Amazing professor. Possibly the best professor I've had outside of my home department. Once you take one class with him, you're completely used to his teaching style, expectations, and grading methods. Very friendly and always willing to help students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jameson Hirsch	4.6	2	Psychology	495	4	5	4	5	913349	12/23/06	he gives students chances.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karl Hirschman	5.0	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	822319	1/27/09	He will drop so much knowledge on you that you could start using it as weights on a bench press. He occasionally gives so much work that he doesn't even have the time to grade it himself, but if you just power through it you will be ace the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karl Hirschman	5.0	2	Engineering		3	5	5	3	822319	3/20/06	Excellent teacher. He is very clear in his lectures and often goes out of his way to help the students when necessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering	609	5	5	5	3	1258213	3/3/12	This teacher was very knowledgeable in the subject, and made it fun to learn. There was one project that you work on throughout the course while doing a few small labs. Not a lot of homework, but very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering	547	3	5	5	4	1258213	11/13/11	Despite what others have said, this professor is a great teacher. There may be a lot of work, but in the end you'll actually understand the subject matter. If you get stuck, just show up in his office hours and he'll help you out! If you do the quizzes and homeworks, you'll do well on tests and do well in the course. Labs are fun and realistic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	2	1258213	4/25/11	very high use of the book to teach yourself, lecture very dull. quiz, HW, labs, and test do not relate to each other.if you are in the class good luck
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	404	1	1	1	3	1258213	2/28/10	Made HW and labs mandatory for turn in but never graded them or gave feedback. 1st lecture week 4 after several HW assignments. Made sure student's self esteem stayed as low as possible. Exams were on labs that were never graded. Expected the book to teach 90% of the material to you. If you have him get out or seek assistance from other professors!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering	609	3	5	5	2	1258213	1/28/12	He's a good instructor, if you work hard you'll do fine. Ask for help! He required going to office hours every week to turn in homework, which seemed like a pain at first, but as a result you'll do well on the quizzes and exams. Time consuming, but fun class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering	609	3	5	4	3	1258213	11/11/11	Great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	609	3	1	1	1	1258213	2/3/11	totally vague and inaudible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clark Hochgraf	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	123	3	1	1	4	1258213	3/2/09	The man is oblivious. His lectures are worthless and he can't answer questions. Never returned graded work, didn't even post final grades on time. Since he is new he curves grades so it doesn't look bad for him but he doesn't teach anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Glenn  Hoff	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	4	2	1805618	4/1/13	I have disliked almost all the criminal justice classes so far at RIT, however I loved Hoff's Management in Criminal Justice. Quizzes and Tests are online and open book. He makes a boring topic interesting. Class isn't "mandatory" but each class is worth 2 points. I would take another class of his.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Hoffman	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	5	1694520	11/17/12	Dr. Hoffman is one of the few professors I've had that is willing to change how he teaches based on student feedback. He's eager to help students and actually helpful when you ask him questions. He has a few pedagogical tendencies that can make class frustrating or unclear, but overall is a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Hoffman	4.4	2	Mathematics	306	3	4	4	4	1694520	3/8/12	Moderately helpful. More helpful one-on-one, but if you take the class at 8 am, he is not awake. Ask questions as he is helpful in answering them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Hoffman	4.4	2	Mathematics	316	2	5	4	3	1694520	11/11/12	Good professor, teaches a difficult subject reasonably well, and makes sure that you do understand the subject in office hours. Sometimes he does ramble on for a proof or long derivation for a while, bu he does tie it all back together.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Hoffman	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	1694520	2/16/12	Although Dr. Hoffman just began this quarter, he is an amazing professor. He is very energetic about his work and encourages thinking beyond the application of numbers. He is willing to work with you and is very approachable. Two exams and a final, one quiz (besides exam weeks) and a homework assignment every week. Pay attention and do the
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chun Kun Hoi	4.4	2	Finance	350	3	5	4	4	957453	11/23/09	It is a good combo of tough, with opportunities to get a good grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chun Kun Hoi	4.4	2	Finance		2	5	5	5	957453	4/9/08	..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chun Kun Hoi	4.4	2	Finance		1	5	3	2	957453	10/17/07	really good teacher, but also tough. Makes you work for your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chun Kun Hoi	4.4	2	Finance	440	1	5	4	4	957453	5/14/08	Not gonna lie, he is hard. Nevertheless, you will learn a lot and you will like him at the end. Plus he makes the class very interactive and interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chun Kun Hoi	4.4	2	Finance	101	4	5	5	5	957453	2/9/08	He's an excellent professor. You can learn real and new things in his class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	907866	2/9/09	Amazing teacher for FYE. Lax but gets all the information and material to us.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	907866	10/10/08	Dawn is amazing. FYE is a joke but shes makes it great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	907866	11/16/07	nice person and good instructor considering FYE is a joke anyway
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	907866	11/18/08	Dawn is an amazing professor, and makes it a goal to get to know her students. She is very active with on campus activities. Her class is simple. FYE: show up, participate in class, do the few assignments, get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	907866	3/18/08	Very nice instructor for a joke of a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn Herman	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	907866	10/31/06	FYE is easy anyway, but this prof is the easiest it gets. she's always finding excuses to let the class out early and makes sure to bring candy every week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Herring	4.0	2	Physics		3	5	5	4	1251058	4/19/09	Best physics teacher that i have ever had. Explains everything well, very helpful if you need it, and is very reasonable with grading and homework. Probably the best physics prof. you will find at this school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Herring	4.0	1	Physics	311	4	3	3	3	1251058	2/11/09	He's an okay professor. Not too bad. Pretty fair, kind of a push-over. Grading is fair and not too much homework. Very smart but, not good at teaching at all but overall not that bad of a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Herring	4.0	2	Physics	313	3	4	4	4	1251058	2/18/09	Best physics prof I've had yet at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Herring	4.0	2	Physics	311	4	4	4	3	1251058	1/28/09	Kind of funny in his habits, but he helps you understand the material well. Sort of awkward, but in a way that is somewhat inviting for people that need extra help. Probably one of the most lax professors I've had yet. Homework is mostly all on Webassign, and the labs are usually simple, just don't miss any (he will deduct significantly)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	5	1279214	2/7/13	Very helpful and nice. Was willing to meet outside of class to help with any difficulties for labs. I've had her for multiple class, would highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science	201	3	5	5	4	1279214	5/16/11	Christine is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had. Class lectures are interesting and relevant to the homework and tests. In Imaging for New Media, the majority of your grade is photo projects. The projects are time consuming, but fun, and she grades easily as long as you fulfill the requirements. She's extremely flexible with late work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	4	1279214	10/28/09	Christine is SUCH an amazing teacher. She's worked extensively in the field, so she knows what she's talking about and how to teach it. Her homework can take a lot of time, but it often fosters creativity and is therefore actually "fun" as far as homework goes. If you try at all, she grades very generously. Do yourself a favor and take her!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	5	1279214	9/17/12	Great professor. Incredibly helpful. Her class inspired me to change my major to Media Art and Technology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science		4	5	3	5	1279214	2/1/10	Okay prof. Test content consists of asking the class what they think is important, and writing it on the board. Sometimes forgets she tells different sections different information. Extensive busywork that is time-consuming. HOWEVER, she will work with you for any of your problems and is flexible with late work. Side note: She laughs frequently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Heusner	4.8	2	Imaging Science	206	3	5	5	4	1279214	10/20/09	Christine is AWESOME. i took imaging for new media with her and it was on of my favorite classes. she is extremely helpful and she wants you to do well in her class. turn in assignments on time and follow the instructions on projects and you will get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics	282	4	4	2	3	67405	12/3/07	Decent teacher. Seems demanding at first, but I got used to her class eventually. Tests weren't bad, and not too much homework. She FLYS through the material with minimal explanation, but was always available to help at office hours. Helps to have a good background before taking her class. Would recommend for Project-Based 2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67405	10/4/07	Had her for calc 2 and multivariable. Awesome professor. Grades fairly, tests are easy and gives great lectures. Although some people think shes mean, she is quite nice and funny. Would highly recommend and take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	5	67405	5/2/05	Nice lady, but not an effective teacher. She is very confusing at times and messes up often while giving examples. Her strong points are assigning easy mathematica labs and is helpful one-on-one with questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	67405	2/21/05	Ok, so she's not the greatest, could be worse, but she doesn't seem to explain what she wants for projects (as a hint, GO OVERBOARD with descriptions, and it's still not enough), ok grader, tests are fine, punctual with grading and putting answers on the web... nice and approachable, willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		2	5	2	1	67405	10/20/04	dumbest class ever and a waste of time. but a very nice lady
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	67405	5/11/04	She is a great teacher. I was so happy to get her, always answers questions and is avaible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	NULL	67405	3/8/04	Went through things very fast. Just did examples out of the book. Tests weren't too hard.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics	282	3	3	2	4	67405	11/8/07	She is a nice lady but not a good teacher. I have always been really good in Calc and I had a hard time understanding stuff i already knew. She is helpful if you seek her out but she tends to explain too quickly like you already know what shes showing you. She has a very old school approach to teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics	282	2	4	4	5	67405	10/31/06	she's a super sweet lady and always willing to answer questions. people have complained that she bases her lectures too much off of examples, but i personally learned a lot from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67405	4/12/05	It's a shame I'm not taking calc IV with this lady. Her lectures were straightforward and she's very approachable for individual help- just do the homework and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	67405	10/25/04	So nice I made sure I had he twice!!! She is a very nice lady who will help you whenever you need it. Her test questions are basically the homework problems with differant constants. I would recomend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	1	Mathematics		1	4	1	NULL	67405	5/14/04	worst class of my life. Stay very far away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	0	Mathematics	253	1	1	1	NULL	67405	4/7/04	I should've checked around earlier, Prof. Hill was just ridiculous in how she approached the class. It was as if failure was acceptable. Class averages were always low and she did nothing to make it better. Stay away!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Hill	3.4	0	Mathematics	252	1	1	1	NULL	67405	11/18/03	Her teaching methods are very poor. Nothing is explaied clearly and her tests are much too hard. She claims the tests are made to "separate the boys for the men." She made the course much tougher than it needed to be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hinesley	4.5	2	Women's Studies		5	5	5	5	1646797	11/22/11	Henry is a very nice and caring professor. His classes are all discussion based. The class is very interesting, and there isn't a hard work load. I would recommend this class to everyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hinesley	4.5	2	Women's Studies		4	4	4	4	1646797	11/16/11	Good professor! Very interesting class. I would suggest that anybody interested in LGBT studies take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Hirsch	5.0	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	1145837	3/19/11	I LOVE RICK HIRSCH
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Hirsch	5.0	2	Fine Arts	150	3	5	5	5	1145837	6/11/08	One of the best teachers at RIT. He makes his artwork and is pretty hot in the ceramics field. Take a class from him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Merle Hirsh	4.1	2	Science		4	5	2	4	67484	11/17/08	He is one of the greatest people I know. He is very nice to the students, has a sense of humor and is extremely helpful. His classes are not that hard either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Merle Hirsh	4.1	2	Science		5	5	4	4	67484	10/23/05	Very easy class, easy A. No tests, quizzes, or homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Merle Hirsh	4.1	1	Science	211	5	4	2	2	67484	10/18/05	Very easy and interesting but talks very low and unclear.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Merle Hirsh	4.1	2	Science		5	5	5	4	67484	11/22/05	Teaches the material visually and verbally equally (watched movies like Gatacca and Equilibrium). Is knowledgable and thought-provoking. Illness caused him to miss many classes, so my critque is only of half a course.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	1	Physics	101	4	3	3	3	808433	2/13/12	He does not use the myCourses at all, which makes it difficult. Any materials he wants you to have, you have to go to his own website that is a time machine from the 90s. If you're good at physics, his class is a miny cakewalk, you can probably skip once a week. Tests are easy, labs he grades a little tougher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics	311	1	1	1	3	808433	1/11/11	This professor is awful !! If you want to learn physics don't take him. He enjoys confusing you and never actually gets to the answer of a problem. He has enthusiasm for his subject matter but doesn't teach in an understandable way. Good Luck if you take this guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		2	2	1	2	808433	2/27/08	Much, much easier than some math/science department profs. His tests require only a rudimentary understanding AND he allows 'cheat sheets'. He also will reschedule tests and Mastering Physics if need be. But he is very poor at teaching the material and answering questions, very incoherent and not helpful, but highly recommended over Morabito.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		3	1	1	1	808433	3/17/06	SO horrrible!!!worst in the entire science department! confuses u so much u forget wat u question was in the first place! and he seriously doesnt know wat he keeps talkin... out of about 35 students, 15 sleep every class and loads dont come! i would advice anyone to avoid him completely!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	5	808433	2/6/06	This guy only wants to prove that you can;t do the work my entire class failed the first exam! I withdrew cause i had one of the highest scored, 46%
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics	701	2	2	1	4	808433	10/4/05	If you want to be taught how to understand a subject, and want to be able to apply it in practical and meaningful ways, this is not the professor for you. If you are a math student and like theoretical methods (name of the class) for solving problems you might enjoy his test. However for a class aimed at scientists and engineers, he's ineffective
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	2	Physics		4	5	4	5	808433	11/24/04	what a guy. If you do your work he's a great guy. he got a little tough on the guys who fooled around, but on the whole he is very good.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	808433	11/16/11	I don't know what other people think about him but after taking his class, physics III was so easy compared to when I took a higher rating teacher for physics II
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		5	2	2	1	808433	9/6/10	Went to class 3 times all quarter for exams only got CCB on exams and got a final grade of B. Physics 3. Easiest teacher i'n RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	1	Physics		2	3	3	2	808433	1/27/08	He is a character. His shirt always comes untucked so you can see his gut. He tries really hard to tell jokes. He has a weird lump on his stomach. He can go off on tangents about hurricanes. He is boring during lecture but has interesting labs. Not a bad teacher but be perpared. The test are hard and nothing like the HW.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics	311	1	1	1	3	808433	5/2/06	WOrst teacher ever don't take this class this guy sucks
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	808433	3/8/06	AVOID AVOID AVOID! One of the worst teachers that I have taken so far. Very unclear, and he is always making misakes on examples, on tests, and on answer sheets. His tests are unbelievable, and like said below, he would probable fail his own tests. Take this class only if you already know physics, then the class should be easy, other that STAY AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	808433	2/5/06	This guy really is the worst Physics teacher at RIT. His class prepares you in no way for his exams, and the only way to pass is if you are already good in Physics (most people aren't). For a class full of engineers.. it's simply awful. And his jokes are god forsaken awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Hodge	2.1	0	Physics		3	1	1	4	808433	11/29/04	This guy is the most unclear, arbitrary, useless teacher at RIT. He needs to be constantly corrected, i doubt that he could pass his own tests. He grades so many things incorrectly, it sucks. You can complain about ur grade and talk to him, but if he doesn't like you, you got it bad.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Hoffman	3.5	2	Physical Education		5	4	3	4	1695931	2/22/12	A wonderful class with a great instructor. You get to have tons of fun, learn ice skating, and get credit! Problems: she divides time unfairly to beginner's group, and her sub is bad. For those who hate it: you get to skip 5 times, but why would you?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valorie Hohman	4.0	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	742094	1/28/06	Very energetic and explained things as well as you can explain theatre arts. Really organized and overall a nice person. Extra-credit giver!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science		2	4	5	5	408868	3/5/12	Holden is a nice guy but can be impatient at times when students ask for help. This class is a lot of work but is manageable if you keep on top of it. Midterm / Final practical and written grades are scaled depending on grade distribution. Changed class to incorporate Amazon AWS to allow work to be done outside of labs at home.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	219	3	4	4	4	408868	7/21/09	I was worried taking this class because I had three different programming professors this year. However, Holden is a great guy and the class was fairly easy. The final project was definitely difficult, but that was to be expected. I wish I could take him for a class in the fall, but the class he's teaching doesn't fit my schedule.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science		4	4	3	3	408868	11/20/07	Pretty complex topic covered by class, but he explains it fairly well and is very helpful. A little monotone and just reading from slides makes it hard to pay attention at times, but is a very fair grader and he does really know the stuff he teaches. Written tests are pretty challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	221	5	5	5	5	408868	6/25/06	Very good teacher, would take any class with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	360	2	5	5	1	408868	10/25/05	One of the best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	218	4	5	5	5	408868	1/4/11	He is the best Teacher I have ever know! I would take any class with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	460	1	4	4	2	408868	3/30/08	Tech Transfer. Really knows the topic, covers it well. Hard grader, will definitely get you to be short and to the point. Lectures are long, and boring. Soft course, and it is opinion and theory based, but he grades really hard. Final was easy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science		4	5	5	4	408868	5/18/07	Thank God! RIT has atleast one excellent professor. IT department in general has good professors and he is one of them . He is the best! I highly recommend him for just any class. yeahhh Go Holden!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science	219	3	5	4	3	408868	11/9/05	Lectures were somewhat vague at times, but he really knows the subject material. Is always available during office hours and is very helpful. My only complaint is the lack of explanation on homework assignments. If you go to class, it is very difficult to do poorly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Holden	4.5	2	Information Science		3	5	4	NULL	408868	5/13/04	Hard tests. Excellent teacher. Very helpful outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	2	Physics	315	3	5	5	5	574904	1/24/12	If you're willing to put in the work she's great. If you're an engineer cult-ist, you will hate her because you're lazy, whiny, and don't believe in good work ethic. To think they'll be building our bridges some day....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	0	Physics		3	1	2	2	574904	12/15/10	she is so annoying. unless you're in the physics-major cult you will hate her. her classes were almost always useless, talking more about her lame jokes than material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	2	Physics		4	5	4	5	574904	9/9/09	Had no background in programming, she had me feeling very comfortable with it just a few weeks in. Also, she helped me fully understand free-body diagrams, to the point where I am basically an expert with them. Was funny and entertaining, even had a special thumbshake with one student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	2	Physics		4	4	4	3	574904	10/18/05	Good teacher, it's a hard subject and a lot of people don't get it but she understands that and will work with you if you try.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	574904	2/7/11	useless teacher. do not take her. ever. you will regret it and so will your gpa.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	2	Physics	313	3	4	4	3	574904	10/21/09	She's a good teacher in my opinion. Physics III is a hard course so people say she is harder than she is. All physics III tests are common and she does a great job at teaching so she's a good pick to have for physics if you want a good professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	1	Physics		2	2	4	4	574904	10/24/05	Hard tests and homework, uses webassign alot - very hard, but she does "adjust the grade" based on the class average.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dawn hollenbeck	3.2	1	Physics		2	3	3	3	574904	2/28/05	She is okay as a person, she has a goofy laugh, her grading and tests are just insane. I don't think I'm that bad of a student, but I am going to have to retake this class (and not take it with her).a
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcus Holmes	5.0	2	Engineering	890	5	5	5	5	722642	5/9/12	Holmes is the best teacher, he will help you no matter if your stuck with one or more problems.He explained a lot to me and i understand what he was telling me, then i just finish all my work before it due on that day.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	1	Electrical Engineering		2	2	4	4	1104736	2/26/13	Course revolved around the textbook, read the chapters and know them well. Hoople is a great guy, really nice, but he really has trouble explaining stuff in a way where it doesn't seem like he's reading the book. Exams are pretty predictable. First exam was on material he explained in under half an hour. That was bad, I did poorly on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		1	3	4	5	1104736	8/20/12	I found professor Hoople easy to approach and very relaxed however. He basically copied his notes on the board. He did not teach everythig needed to do the homework. He gave test questions that did not provide sufficient material to be answered. With this teacher you are going to do very well if u can teach everything to yourself or you will fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	0	Electrical Engineering	481	2	2	2	4	1104736	5/24/12	Worst electronics teacher. Teaches directly from the book and goes insanely fast through the material. Hard to follow in class and comprehend. Not very helpful overall. Sometimes assigns insanely long homework assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	1	Electrical Engineering		3	3	3	5	1104736	3/13/10	I liked him as a person but his teaching is more like copying out of the text if anything. Whatever you learn in this class will probably be learned on your own. Do not take Electronics 1 with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	5	1104736	10/26/09	Would rather play with Mr Potato head dolls than help students understand HW. Admitted in class that he was too busy watching desperate house wives to actually find the errors in the homework, so he just took points off if his answer was slightly different. His teaching style makes inherently easy material seem almost incomprehensible. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	481	2	5	4	4	1104736	6/4/09	I had him for circuits1 and electronics1,1 of the best profs Iv had. lots of examples, straightforward tests. yes, they are very hard courses and the tests are tough, but he does a really good job presenting the material, I agree with the poster below about electronics, But he still presented the material much better than most profs. Highly recomme
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	1104736	3/9/09	One of the best professors this school has to offer. Teaching style is so straight forward and you can tell he cares about his students. He even spends time in class going over homework and if you still don't get it, he is also very helpful during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	1104736	2/21/08	Very helpful and a great teacher. Really helps you to grasp the topic. But hard to get ahold of outside of his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	381	5	5	5	3	1104736	4/28/07	This guy is good. Very helpful made classes interesting and quizzes/tests were very reasonable. If you go to class on a regular basis, you should do very well. Be careful about which lab professor you select. This is how you could get screwed! Make sure the TA isn't a jerk and you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	5	5	1104736	2/3/06	Now that I've seen this guy on RL (Real Life) he is the SHIZNITE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	382	3	5	5	4	1104736	2/15/13	Dr. Hoople was an excellent circuits II professor, very helpful and clear in lecture. The tests were on the harder side but if you did the homework they weren't too bad. He is a strict grader however. He's a nice guy and very approachable if you need help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	4	4	1104736	6/11/12	Had him for Circuits I and II, loved him, so I decided to have him for Electronics I, and it was a completely different world. For circuits, he explains things very clearly, his own way, which makes things very easy. However, for electronics, he just read from the book, and went far too quickly. He is very helpful outside of class for both though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	0	Electrical Engineering		2	1	3	3	1104736	12/15/10	he teaches WAY to fast. stands in front of the board when he writes so you have to sit and wait, then you start writing and he's already 2 examples ahead of you when you finish. two sets of homework every week, 8 problems each. quiz or test every friday.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	381	4	5	5	4	1104736	1/31/10	Teacher is very helpful, examples are clear and all questions are adequately answered. Awesome Professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	0	Electrical Engineering		1	2	2	4	1104736	10/26/09	Had him for digital electronics. Stands in front of the board so no one can see what he writes, and when he moves on to write something new, everyone is still copying down his old stuff so everything he says just goes in one ear out the other. Takes off 20% if your answer is +-3% off from his. Asks questions that he immediately answers himself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	1	Electrical Engineering	481	3	2	3	4	1104736	5/29/09	I wouldn't advise taking this particular class (Electronics I) with him for a bit longer - say, 20093-ish: let him find his groove first. He had lots of trouble keeping the class sync'd with the labs - I had to learn much of the material straight from the book. There for office hours. Tests were open-book, but you'll still need to study like crazy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	545	3	5	5	4	1104736	3/3/08	Great professor. This class could have been much much worse than it was. Homework was hard, but it prepared you for the exams. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		1	5	4	1	1104736	1/29/08	i'm not an EE, and i was able to pass. he spent hours with me in ofice hours and was very helpful. If I had to take another EE class, i'd take one of his.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	381	2	4	4	1	1104736	11/27/06	This dude did at one point know what he was doing (i.e. when he wrote his notes) but now all he does is read from the pages he has already written, mistakes and all. Do well on the first two exams because the last two are killers! Stay up with the HW, and for the lab portion, make sure you get a good labbie (your grade depends on it!).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	4	1104736	1/30/06	One of the clearest presenters of information I've ever had at RIT. Does plenty of examples, will go over material again if people don't get it. Gives a decent amount of homework, but grades it fairly. Tests and quizzes are also very fair. Overall, two thumbs up.

Good grader, won't penalize much as long as theory & procedure is right. Tests are just like class examples. Get him for your circuits classes if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Hoople	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		2	4	4	4	1104736	1/24/05	He'd a good teacher, and will help you if you go to his office. Seems to be a tough grader on tests though... sometimes too tough. Decent homework policy. Overall good teacher

Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Hopkins	3.2	1	Electrical Engineering	381	5	3	3	5	1405583	3/8/12	Not the most helpful instructor. Gets confused by questions. Explains material moderately well. Spends most of lecture working examples from the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Hopkins	3.2	0	Electrical Engineering	514	2	1	3	4	1405583	4/4/11	Very unhelpful in general. Doesn't post solutions to exams ("you should already know how to do it"), doesn't answer hw questions in office hours, etc. He wants you to learn everything out of the book. In lectures, spends excessive time on basic things like simple algebra while brief on more important concepts. I personally wouldn't recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Hopkins	3.2	2	Electrical Engineering	351	4	4	5	5	1405583	2/27/12	I really liked this guy, very calm warm speaker and gets everything up on the board. Course is familiar territory if you've already taken Physics3. Not a hard course, just the right amount of homework. Gets a little tougher at the end. Optional final else he counts your test average as final (wont tell you this till the end though)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Hopkins	5.0	2	Economics		4	5	5	5	1558726	12/24/12	Great Professor! enjoyed taking microeconomics with him. Explains the subject matter very clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Hopkins	5.0	2	Economics		3	5	5	4	1558726	11/9/11	I had Professor Hopkins for Honors Economics this quarter. His class was challenging, but I enjoyed it. He's a great teacher and very concerned that his students understand the material. 3 papers, midterm, final, and online homeworks. Tests are hard, so study hard. Overall, a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Hopkins	5.0	2	Economics		4	5	5	5	1558726	5/13/12	One of the best economics professors I've had. Very scholarly (and grandfatherly, lol). Class (benefit-cost analysis) was very interesting, and Dr. Hopkins presented the material in a very effective manner.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Hopkins	5.0	2	Economics	450	3	5	5	3	1558726	10/29/11	The best economics professor in my opinion. Took him for micro and benefit-cost analysis. Grades are usually a few large assignments and the two exams. He knows his stuff and if you follow along in the textbook you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		3	1	1	2	1485378	3/10/12	never responded my questions with patience
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		2	3	1	1	1485378	8/25/11	Not a good professor since he treats all students like a joke. He ignores their comments and continue with his lectures. He don't know nothing. I basically learned nothing and no clues of what it is about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		5	1	2	1	1485378	6/29/11	Horne is the worst professor I have had thus far. He is rude, does not listen to students' opinions, and interrupts students in the middle of presentations. He picks on individual students and mocks them in front of the class. His class was a COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME. I learned nothing. He "taught" common sense topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		3	2	1	1	1485378	3/10/12	Not a good professor, never responded my questions with patience, and was not able to explain things clearly. I am so afraid of taking his class again... oh no..no..no... I
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		1	1	1	1	1485378	8/25/11	Worst professor ever. Disrespect to students esp. deaf! Don't know how to teach. Don't take him. Please! He don't care for students while giving lectures. He thinks he is right always.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Horne	1.3	0	Hospitality		3	1	1	1	1485378	2/2/11	Probably one of the most boring professors Ive had in my entire College experience. Completely clueless on how to teach a class, and refuses to take anybody elses opinions into consideration. Stay far away!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	0	Engineering		3	1	1	3	562647	1/6/09	She doesn't seem prepared at all to be teaching materials processing. She doesn't know what she's talking about at all (it's obvious even if you're a freshman that has never had this class or anything like it before) and she can't answer simple questions. Class so disorganized it's frustrating. She grades homework based almost entirely on format.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	0	Engineering		3	1	2	1	562647	5/13/08	she does not teach enough to do the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	562647	12/4/06	I liked the course a lot. I had no programming knowledge prior to taking this course and still aced it. Homework assignments can be tedious and long, but definitely are very doable (information on VBA is all over google). She makes a good attempt to be helpful and the class itself isn't hard. If you pay attention and do the h/w it's a breeze.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	1	Engineering		3	3	2	2	562647	5/11/06	Bad teacher and her false enthusiasm during class doesn't help either. She does not teach you enough to complete her homework assignments, nor does she do more to help you than say, "Look at the PowerPoint." Oh, and don't expect the TA to be too helpful either. Make sure you have the book and know some other kids in the class or you'll do terribly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	562647	5/3/05	Assignemnts are quite easy. If you do not understand something she will explain it to you and work with you until you get it. Trys to make all material interesting adn generally succedes. Over all a good choice

Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	2	Engineering		4	3	4	3	562647	11/19/08	Class is not set up very well. We cover a lot of random topics for a short period of time. Too much time is spend on basic concepts while more complicated ones are just briefly mentioned. Homework isn't too hard, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the class, and it can be time consuming. Midterm and final were both very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	2	Engineering	304	5	5	5	2	562647	4/23/08	Excellant professor, if she seems hard go to packaging science
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	2	Engineering		3	3	4	4	562647	10/31/06	class itself not too interesting, homework was difficult but just took time to figure out, if you try to do it the day before you will be up all night, but she grades fairly easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	1	Engineering		2	4	1	3	562647	4/2/06	She is a nice lady and overall will try to hep you. But her homework assignments are retarded. She either is very vague or the assignments are ridiculous. For example,It'd be like if she gave a you a lesson on how to use a hammer and then told you to go build a skyscraper with it for homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Hortop	3.1	1	Engineering		4	3	3	4	562647	1/31/05	Pretty easy classes, but she tries to make even boring classes interesting. Overall a good choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	2	Psychology	101	3	4	3	4	1623022	11/22/11	Frustrating class, I came in wanting to learn a lot and she treated the class like we were second graders. Doesn't have her act together and the class was inefficient. Avoid her if you can and save yourself the headache
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	1	Psychology		2	2	3	3	1623022	11/12/11	Tests are hard, low class average. Avoid this teacher if you can. Other psychology teachers are extremely easy while Hotailing makes everything difficult. Very feminist and biased. Papers due every class and if she doesn't agree with your opinion you get a bad grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	0	Psychology	101	2	1	2	1	1623022	10/11/11	she teaches straight from the book. tests are on a lot of material calss avg on first test was 73. test long multiple choiice. she is boring and not interesting at all hard to pay attention
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	2	Psychology		3	5	4	2	1623022	11/14/11	The previous comments are very misleading. Although we may have to cover a LOT of material in just one quarter, she tries to be as fair as possible with the tests and extra 1 page papers due every class to boost your grade. If you study, you will do perfectly fine and pass with a decent grade. If you do not like studying, don't take this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	2	Psychology		4	5	4	3	1623022	11/11/11	Enjoyed this class, never really fallen asleep in class. Didnt think it was boring and my interest level was medium -- psych pretty interesting. She WILL help you understand concepts, has given a couple curves, response paper due every class, tests/examples STRAIGHT from the text, study the vocab and you'll be fine. I really liked this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Hotaling	3.1	0	Psychology		3	1	3	2	1623022	10/2/11	She teaches heavily from the text book, be sure to read it. Attendance is not mandatory. A fair number only show up to class to be social. Taught in a stadium setting. Don't get much from lectures. Text is mostly what teaches the students. Exams questions are mostly questions taken from the text book's online supplement. Lots of vocab.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	300	3	5	5	4	278069	2/7/13	A privilege to have had this very brilliant and generous in passing knowledge to students and a warm Professor. She is not shallow because she has EXPERIENCED not just educated in LIFE. I LOVE HER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		3	5	5	1	278069	7/28/09	The previous review was dated in May 2009 but it was not possible to rate this professor's performance because she was on medical leave last year. Maybe that's why the other reviewer gave Dr. Housel such a negative rating--the reviewer didn't actually have Dr. Housel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	1	278069	11/23/08	Professor Housel is just an amazing teacher. She covers very interesting topics, and is very nice to the class. She doesn't test, but there are papers and journal entries to do for writing seminar, all of which were either easy, or at least interesting. All of her assignments were very interesting and made you want to do them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	319	3	5	5	2	278069	5/1/08	This is a writing class, and as a technical person I hate writing. Even this small comment panel is arduous for me to fill. I have never found any interest in writing until I took one of Dr. Housel's classes. I will be writing my first published creative story, and loving every moment of it. Her writing classes did not just teach me, they changed m
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	210	5	5	5	5	278069	12/3/07	fun, interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	3	278069	3/27/06	She is and amazing teacher. We watched three movies and as long as you follow directions on the papers you get at least a B if not an A. Go to every to as many classes as you can, if you can email her and explain why and she most likely wont mind if you dont miss to many, very friendly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	4	3	278069	6/23/05	Housel is the coolest professor I have had. Great sense of humor and always tries to help you out. She has helped me out of a couple of pickles already and she is just plain awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	3	278069	2/26/05	Housel is AWESOME and knows how to make you chuckle/smile! I loved her class & looked forward to it. Some of the readings were downright awful but she made it bareable. She cares about ALL of her students & is willing to help in EVERY way. Point Blank: I wish I could take more classes with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	4	4	3	278069	1/15/05	Very easy teacher, however, if you don't agree with her, class can be very unpleasant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		4	4	5	5	278069	11/11/04	Best Teacher Ever. 'Nuff said. This is the only class I made a real attempt not to miss. Prof. Housel is the teacher you want to take W&L from. No questions asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	101	4	5	5	1	278069	8/3/09	She was the best teacher I had while at RIT, the only one who actually cared about her students and the only one who realized that she wasn't the only class we were taking. I would take anything she taught just to be in a class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	0	English		5	1	2	1	278069	5/22/09	Very nice person, however her views are very biased. If you don't agree with her, the class can be a nightmare...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		4	5	5	3	278069	8/25/08	She is one of the best teachers I have had at RIT. She makes class fun!! She is one of the few teachers that really cares about her students!! I would highly suggest having her atleast once in your RIT experience!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	504	5	5	4	4	278069	1/27/08	She is totally amazing. Really funny and fun and wants everyone to do well. She doesn't believe in tests but encourages you to do your best. She kept my interest the entire quarter and was a easy grade. She makes going to class really fun and worth your time and money
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	227	5	5	5	5	278069	2/7/07	An amazing teacher and one of the best English teacher's I've had yet. Also one of the easiest classes you will take in college.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	3	278069	7/14/05	She has been the best professor I've had so far in my 3 years here. She made the class sooo fun and we still learned a lot. She loves talking about movies. We acutally watched Gladiator and A Mid Summer Nights Dream, the newest one. She really cares about her students and it's also very easy to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	4	278069	3/1/05	You can't get any better than her. Shes the greatest! She managed to keep me awake at 8am. What a miracle. Easy class. TAKE IT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		4	5	5	4	278069	2/22/05	One of my favorite professors here. No tests, no quizzes, just a few papers and none of them long. Definatly the professor you want to take writing and lit with!! If you mention that you like comic heroes and action movies, you will be in great shape for the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	3	278069	1/12/05	She is great! I would definatly recomend her for Writing and Lit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English	101	4	5	5	3	278069	10/25/04	She is VERY nice. Grades rather easy, she teaches the way teachers should. Her goal seems to be to make students learn something. I HIGHLY recommend her for first year's, it makes a nice break from in your face teachers.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	NULL	278069	6/2/04	She was one of those professors you always wish you will have in your college career. She was always there to help in not only your academic life but also your personal life and really cared about each and every one of her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Housel	4.8	2	English		5	5	5	NULL	278069	4/13/04	the easiest teacher you will ever have in your college career. NO TESTS! NO QUIZES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sam Holcomb	4.5	2	Sign Language		3	4	5	5	721413	5/1/07	SO nice. one of the sweetest teacher's i've ever had. Really tries to make sure everyone understands. Very funny, too.I reccommend him highly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Holland	2.5	2	Fine Arts	101	4	4	4	4	1288596	1/31/10	Really nice guy - projects weren't too hard. Most people seemed to get a decent grades. Some projects are a bit open, but he generally likes the direction people go in. It's a fun class - he's pretty laid back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Holland	2.5	0	Fine Arts	231	1	1	1	4	1288596	5/19/09	Honestly? James Holland ruined 2D for me this year. he has trouble explaining/clarifying assignments, and his assignments take HOURS to decipher. if he decides he doesnt like what you create, then he trashes it. He grades based on the "c is average" principle. consequently only one person in my class got an A, even though many deserved one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Hollick	4.5	2	Physician Assistant Studies		2	5	4	5	1586602	5/30/11	Took him for Medical Microbiology as part of the PA line of courses. HARD CLASS. Very interesting, and he is helpful in letting you know what is on the exams - although be prepared to study! Studied for a few hours a day for about 3 days prior to his exams and pulled a B. He's knowledgeable and informative, recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science		5	5	3	4	288990	4/2/12	Nice Prof. Easy going. Easy to get A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	0	Computer Science	380	1	2	2	4	288990	5/27/09	Homan is a nice guy, and I'm sure very brilliant, but he is a terrible teacher. He does not explain the material well at all and struggles to answers questions at a level students can understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	1	Computer Science	482	2	3	3	3	288990	5/19/09	Had him for Cryptography. He makes class really enjoyable and is really helpful. For Cryptography, the homeworks require a LOT of time and effort, but are fairly graded, and other than the midterm and final, they're all you have to do in the class. The two exams were both a lot easier than I expected, and also graded fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science	236	2	5	4	5	288990	11/24/08	He likes to challenge his students, which results in harder tests and labs. However he is very accessible and helpful in class and outside, and seems to genuinely care that his students learn. Take him if you want to work hard and learn a ton.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	288990	3/8/04	My Grade: B. Professor Homan is an outstanding teacher. He is friendly, helpful, and easily approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	288990	11/17/11	Awesome professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science	380	1	3	5	1	288990	5/25/09	Very tough grader, doesn't offer help for assignments prior to their due dates, and blew me off when seeking help prior to final. Good Lecturer, but the bad outweigh the good in his case
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science	236	2	5	4	5	288990	11/26/08	I had Professor Homan for my first CS class and it was quite a challenge. However, that is what made the class great. He's always willing to help and it is possible to get an A if you do your work. The grading was weighted 60% towards the exams, which I thought was a bit much and the grading was a little slow, but I definitely recommend his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	288990	10/8/08	An interesting and fun teacher. Grades hard at times, but is fair overall and very helpful when you have a problem with your code. Very organized and puts all lectures/labs/homework online. I recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science	123	3	5	5	3	288990	8/24/05	Awesome prof, he's fun, cool, and good at helping students understand the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science	123	5	5	5	NULL	288990	5/6/04	My Grade: A - Homan is the man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Homan	4.2	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	288990	12/4/03	My Grade: A. Dr. Homan is an enjoyable teacher. Unlike many professors, he makes class fun and interesting. He encourages students to meet with him, either to ask questions or just to talk. As a result of my good experience with him, I chose to take hi
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hopkins	4.2	2	Business		4	4	4	2	992700	6/23/10	I went into the class with absolutely no prior knowledge of the subject, and came out with a very good understanding of microecon. The professor tends to drone on sometimes making it boring but he is an excellent teacher and much better than the others. Very knowledgeable professor. He gives extra credit sometimes. Study the book and you'll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Hopkins	4.2	2	Business		4	5	4	4	992700	1/27/09	Great teacher, he made micro-economics interesting. The class can get a little hard at times but ask questions and read the book and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thaddeus Hopkins	4.3	2	Engineering	381	4	5	4	4	475164	3/12/12	Circuits I Honors: He is very good at teaching but he moves very fast. Often he will be halfway through a solution before you finish copying a diagram. He gives many examples and answers any questions with as much reinforcement as necessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thaddeus Hopkins	4.3	1	Engineering	303	4	3	3	4	475164	5/30/07	Good guy, but sometimes wasn't sure what to do with his own example problems. Certainly better than Kniebel... PowerPoint presentations posted online after the lecture. The material is not too bad- the worst part of the class is sitting through the forgein kids asking ridiculous questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thaddeus Hopkins	4.3	2	Engineering		3	5	4	2	475164	4/27/07	he is a good teacher, very fair. really wanted me to learn the material and was always available for answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thaddeus Hopkins	4.3	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	475164	2/9/06	Great Professor! He is more than willing to just hang out with his students and just talk about anything. Great guy! Everything that is on his quizzes and tests come straight from his power point. I had him last and this quarter and i cant wait for the DDT LAB!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thaddeus Hopkins	4.3	0	Engineering		2	1	2	2	475164	10/26/05	very hard to do labs with him, very hard grading labs

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hornak	3.2	2	Science		2	5	3	4	67467	10/24/11	Bring coffee to class he is rather monotone but he knows his stuff better than anyone. If you are interested in the course he is the best to take. if he can't answer your question he will research it for you until he can. Sometimes he explains things over students' heads but he can tell when he loses people and tries again with a different approach
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hornak	3.2	2	Science	311	4	5	5	5	67467	11/1/09	One of the best professors I've had. He is by far one of the nicest there and is always very welcoming when you have any questions. His quizzes are fair, and the final was in the exact same format.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hornak	3.2	0	Science	311	2	2	1	1	67467	11/16/09	He is really nice as a person but far too smart to relate to students who aren't advanced. The quizzes are mostly online and they are extremely hard even after reading the notes and book, and the final is worth half of the grade which makes this class suck more. Get out if its not a requirement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Hornak	3.2	2	Science	101	3	3	4	1	67467	11/20/08	Very boring teacher. He WILL put you to sleep if you didn't have enough sleep the night before! Quizzes are online and the final is ridiculous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	G Horrocks	4.7	2	Chemistry	216	4	5	5	5	1399160	4/24/10	Greg = Awesome!!!! Really easy grader if your work is of good quality. Very helpful and extremely easy on the eyes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	G Horrocks	4.7	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	4	1399160	1/20/10	lab teacher. very helpful and easygoing, mostly an easy grader too :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	G Horrocks	4.7	2	Chemistry		4	5	4	4	1399160	1/30/10	VERY NICE! Really a sweetheart if you work with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail  Hosking	3.5	2	Writing	101	2	4	3	1	1797600	2/13/13	You have 3 papers and 5 quizzes through the year. The quizzes test what you know from the book, each questions is absolutely ridiculous and it's impossible to get a 100 on any of them. She makes you work your ass off in class, it's incredibly boring and attendance is mandatory. You don't want her for writing seminar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Hotchkiss	5.0	2	Army ROTC		5	5	5	5	745164	11/2/05	Great teacher and wonderful guy. Always available to help you outside of class. Laid back class and only one minor homework assignment the whole quarter. Knows his stuff [after 20 years, he better] and is always willing to share. Very approachable and interested in the performance of his cadets. Hooah!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science	487	1	2	2	5	44249	10/1/12	Terrible teacher she says one thing then grades another way. I was looking forward to this class the whole summer and she completely ruined the class for me. She is incredibly opinionated and if your opinion isn't her's then you can go pound sand. Horrid teacher. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	44249	5/13/11	She is a very fair grader, especially for something as complex as java. Her lectures are very helpful, and makes her expectation for our assignments very clear. Some of her lectures can be a bit boring, but you can tell she knows her stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	240	3	5	4	5	44249	4/10/11	Very interested and interesting. Worked in the industry. Standards reflect what we should expect. Sometimes wrote java when teaching Python, but I had her for an 8am and she was as awake as I would expect of any teacher, regardless of the time. Insistent on text use, but the lectures teach almost everything testable. Read text for midterm review.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	241	4	4	3	5	44249	11/2/10	Average teacher. Class was taught in Python, but she often confused it with Java - sending students who had never seen either for a loop. Very fussy grader - lost points for calling a variable 'f' instead of 'file'. Moves too fast, but available to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	232	1	5	4	5	44249	2/2/10	Trudy is amazing! she is very very helpful. i started taking cs 1 with her and i had never programmed ever in my life. understanding it in the beginning was very hard but once i caught on it became very simple. take advantage of the tutoring center on the third floor whenever possible and you will get A's
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	44249	12/23/09	makes you work but helpful if you get stuck. fussy about projects. I'd take another class from her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	3	44249	5/24/09	Horrible teacher. Didn't get anything out of the lectures, had to read the book to survive. You have to get lucky on the tests or get destroyed. She seemed irritated when going for help outside of class. Project specifications were extremely unclear. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science	232	2	1	1	1	44249	2/11/09	grading is terrible. based mostly on small mistakes, if you do everything correct and screw up one small line she will takes off most of the points. The lecture are so boring and so abstract that they relate to nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	232	4	5	5	5	44249	4/9/08	Took for CS 1, 2, 3 (current). Amazing professor. Clear, not too hard, very available, and motivated. Sometimes makes mistakes during class, but no more than any other professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science		5	1	1	1	44249	10/24/07	She spends half the class going on and on and on about the same thing, and the other half walking around the room. It's helpful if you don't know what you're doing, but otherwise the whole class is a waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	487	4	5	5	5	44249	11/11/11	Great Prof. Had for entire intro sequence, and three years later, Data Mining. Explained things with unbelievable clarity. Entertained questions in class. Number one recommendation for an intro course. Data Mining was a tough, but rewarding class, and you were expected to work a lot on the projects on your own. Tests were never a surprise.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	1	Computer Science	241	4	3	2	5	44249	5/1/11	Kinda ruined python and CS, in general, for me my freshman year. Fussy grader, not very understanding, I didn't enjoy any of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	241	3	5	5	5	44249	11/21/10	Made my introduction to CS really fun. Python was an awesome introductory language, much easier than Java. Labs and homework got pretty difficult, but if you put in the effort you'd get a good grade. If you emailed or asked prof. Howles a question she was able to clarify and help you. Any grading mistakes made could be disputed for credit back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	4	44249	4/14/10	She is fussy about projects but says our boss will be too someday. Also fussy about attendence. She is fair and was the only teacher I had who would actualy help debug my code. I'd take a course again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	4	44249	1/25/10	Awful professor. Students who started learning CS suffer and only survive through ours of practice. Projects are completely unfair in grading. Takes of points everywhere in labs, projects, and tests for small mistakes. Take a different professor. Wouldn't recommend this one at all. :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science	590	2	1	3	3	44249	10/31/09	Horrible teacher (for data mining). Concepts trivial, pacing is slow and boring. Algorithms are uninteresting. Unfair grading of project, even though it was said before hand that certain things would not work properly, she took off points if they did not work anyway. Pointless debates in the class. Repeatedly saying 'contact a domain expert'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	440	5	5	5	5	44249	5/16/09	Excellent professor. Extremely useful lectures to help clarify material covered in the reading. Reasonable workload. Helpful during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science	232	5	4	5	4	44249	2/4/09	GREAT PROF! Her class is pretty slow paced, and she belabors topics into you through plenty examples, code writing, and handouts. Class lectures are clear and informative. She lectures well enough to where reading the textbook is optional. She is always willing to help those who need it. Just do not wait until the deadlines to do so.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	1	44249	2/14/08	shes a nice teacher and her class is pretty easy, i would recommend her for people who are new to CS. But if you have her you MUST work alone with all homeworks, if she detects even a coincidental similarity between codes she will accuse you of copying, so watch out
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	44249	5/17/07	Great professor. Made sure you understood the material before moving on. Gives out handouts that the exams are based off of...The greatest CS professor I have had thus far! Would take again in a heartbeat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	44249	4/23/07	Extremely helpful and an interesting professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	44249	2/2/07	Awesome Professor....she made the subject interesting, her lectures are awesome as she goes over plenty of examples which really make the concept clear. Her projects are challenging but she is always around to help you out. There are no quizzes but the two tests are really easy if you were paying attention.I would take her class again and again....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	3	44249	3/5/06	I would not have made it through without her. She is very patient and helpful. Always willing to answer questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	0	Computer Science	123	1	1	1	5	44249	2/27/06	Trudy is not a good teacher at all... Very unsure of herself, makes multiple mistakes on content, and not very clearl when explaining new concepts. Furthermore, she is a vindictive witch if you go to her office inquiring into her grading policy, which is unanimously voted on by my class as unethically unfair. Avoid this woman at all cost.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	44249	1/30/05	I had her for CS I, II, & III. She's really nice and will take the time to help you if you need it. I would recommend taking her class if you get the chance. From my experiance, her tests are pretty easy and she doesn't give any homework.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	44249	3/1/07	howles was wonderful. i had a bit of trouble understand CS1, but howles just talked in a way that i understood. she was very organized and definitely knew her stuff. i recommend her to everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	44249	10/18/06	Good grader and easy to get along with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	5	44249	3/3/06	I had her for CS3. She is anal about attendance but I see why -- lots of the course isn't in the book. I found her to be fair her tests are fair never anything not covered in lab or class. Projects are tough but i learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	44249	2/8/06	She is VERY NICE! She doesn't get much attention outside of the classroom from students. Go to her office and she will adore you. For the bore of the topics she has to teach (graphing, binary trees), she makes class interesting. Attendance not -required- but if you don't go she gets pissed. Always threatens homework but never gives any.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	2	Computer Science		5	3	4	5	44249	11/2/04	Ms. Howles isn't perfect, but she is compassionate and truly cares about your understanding of the material. I recommend that you take any course with her. She always emails me back the same day!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Trudy Howles	3.6	1	Computer Science		4	2	3	NULL	44249	9/28/02	dont let her know your name, then she will call on you like a dog
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	1025326	10/2/08	Fei Hu was the man. He was always interesting to listen to and made attending CE lectures fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering	250	4	5	4	4	1025326	11/30/05	Some people have problems understanding him. I didn't. He is very interested in what he is teaching. He knows his material. He uses/posts slides online, but isn't limited just the slides. Makes a lot of jokes and makes class easy to stay awake in. Very understanding and cares about his students. 70% of my class got an A or B, but you have to work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		5	5	4	4	1025326	8/12/05	Very fun professor. He explained concepts in class well, with a lot of enthusiasm and class involvement. His homeworks were usually fairly easy and his tests were fair. Sometimes what we did in lab didn't quite connect with what we learned in class, but he tried to help with examples. He definitely cares about his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		5	4	4	4	1025326	2/23/05	Professor Hu is a great teacher. He may be a little hard to understand at times with his accent, but if you've taken some of the other teachers in CE, you don't even notice it. Great notes to follow. He's also not afraid to bring real life stories into the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	1	Engineering	351	4	2	4	NULL	1025326	2/3/03	VERY enthusiastic; unavailable when needed sometimes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	1	Engineering		4	3	3	4	1025326	3/12/06	Very willing to help, although his examples and explanations are not always clear. Better 1 on 1 than in class. He is a relatively easy grader as long as you can show him you know the concepts. Quizes have only a few questions so big mistakes hurt. Final was not nearly as bad as his assembly one, both of which involve(d) concepts not used in labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	1025326	10/24/05	His accent is pretty thick at the beginning of the class, but his true enthusiasm for the material makes move.b a billion times seem fun. Very approachable, tough tests, but by far the best teacher for preparing you for the labs. Make a concious effort to take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		3	4	3	4	1025326	5/1/05	Funny professor, talks about his own life in classrooms and his notes give you hints on every labs you need to do. Long tests sometimes but he did curve that time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fei Hu	4.1	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1025326	11/11/04	This guy is a great teacher. Obviously loves what he's donig and has a lot of enthusiasm. He gives great notes and explains things so they're easier to understand. I'm taking him again for HDL
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	4	3	1333208	3/1/13	Very thorough teacher-he makes the material enjoyable by incorporating real like stuff. A lot of writing, exams for biochem were all short answer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology	311	3	5	5	4	1333208	11/16/12	One of the best Professors at RIT. He cares about his students and wants them to succeed. The class material can be challenging but he works very hard to help students understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	1333208	10/15/12	Hands down the best prof at rit. Very professional and has the students best interest at heart. Very helpful, he will sit with you for hours to make sure you understand the material if you have questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	4	4	1333208	11/1/11	Cool Professor, out of all the professors at RIT thus far, he is the most organized. He knows his stuff. He makes you learn a lot of stuff. He is very fair. Take Hudson for cell bio if you have the chance....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	1333208	9/22/11	I have Hudson for cell bio now, we are only 3 weeks in but he is very good. He breaks it down so you understand. Go to him for help, he is really helpful and he takes his time. He is down to earth and a nice guy. One of the best classes thus far. I am learning a lot and it makes bio fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		3	5	5	3	1333208	3/15/11	Just had Dr. Hudson for plant pathology. He is very good at linking the subject matter at hand to previous courses. He also writes questions to make you think critically instead of memorizing. BTW, he is very approachable and very nice to the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	2	5	3	1333208	11/23/10	Without a doubt the best teacher @ RIT. Had him for cell biology, he is made me understand stuff I didn;t think i could understand. He is hard but fair. If you fail cell bio it is because you did not follow his directions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	4	3	1333208	10/25/10	best teacher at rit
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology	459	2	5	5	4	1333208	5/6/10	Very nice and good to students. I have him for Plant Biochemistry. We have to read a manuscript each week and it teaches you a lot about the subject because it is a different perspective from the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	1333208	11/19/12	Excellent Professor. He sat with me for an hour after giving a review for 2 hours on a Sunday. He will help you if you are willing to help yourself. He responds to you in a timely fashion unlike other professors. I would recommend him for cell biology. I wish he was teaching molecular bio in the winter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	1333208	10/18/12	Cool guy, he is very good in class and relates to students. He is very practical as well. Gives real world examples. if you work hard and follow his directions you will learn a lot. Take heed freshmen, take this guy for cell bio.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	5	5	3	1333208	4/27/12	The bio dept at RIT have some disorganized professors, Hudson is not one of them. He is very good about answering questions and he returns tests, quizzes very fast unlike a lot of professors. He is really down to earth, if you have questions, he doesn't make you feel stupid. I had him for cell bio as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		2	3	5	3	1333208	9/30/11	Dr. H is the best teacher at RIT. Knows his stuff and gives good examples. I am going to enroll in every single class he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		3	5	5	4	1333208	5/2/11	You have to work hard, gives you a lot of opportunities to get a good grade. 4 exams, 3 quiz and you have to read and rewrite a manuscript in your own words. All the exams are short answer essay. Take Hudson if you want to learn, one of the best at RIT. He is always prepared and always have time for you if you go to him for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology	311	2	5	5	5	1333208	11/23/10	Hard but fair, he is passionate about science, gives a lot of real world examples to make the subject clear. His exams are MCQs and shot answer essays, they are not a piece of cake, you have to study. Take Hudson if you really want to learn cell bio. I learned a lot. I did not get an A, but it's one of the best class I took here so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	1333208	11/12/10	He is an amazing teacher and gives you a ton of bonus points. I have an A and do not need to take the final. If you have any questions he will explain it a billion different ways till the students understand. He is one of the nicest down to earth teachers at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	2	Biology		3	5	5	2	1333208	9/13/10	I took cell Bio and Biochem with Dr. Hudson, he was an amazing teacher. He is well organized and returns test material in a timely fashion. He is also asked a lot of questions in the lectures which helps study for the exams. One of the best teachers at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andre Hudson	4.6	1	Biology		2	4	1	4	1333208	10/12/09	He's really helpful if you go to him for help but the stuff you are tested on are unexpected. He doesn't tell you what you need to study, so you're on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Hughes-Smith	5.0	2	Not Specified	101	4	5	5	3	1750071	11/17/12	Great lady, Great teacher. Write down all the powerpoints and youll do great. 2 hour lectures on monday mornings and it kept me awake. Highly Recommended if you are willing to read the 4 books and do a few papers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Hughes-Smith	5.0	2	Not Specified	101	4	5	5	3	1750071	10/11/12	Nice professor who really cares about her subject! Had her for environmental studies. Gives a PP lecture that gives you all you need to know for quizzes (no test until final). Lots of outside reading, though, 4 books that will be on your final. No textbook use at all. Pretty easy-going and friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering	624	4	4	4	5	1413707	2/23/13	Knows his stuff. Class is very interesting. Well structured; however, he takes forever to grade or return items. Tests and quizzes are clear and he prepares you well for them. Class often lets out early. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering		3	4	3	4	1413707	4/25/12	Cool, chill guy. If you go to class and pay attention, you'll do fine. During office hours, he will explain everything from the very beginning, so make sure to take advantage of that! I enjoyed the class, though he takes a while to hand work back sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering		4	3	5	3	1413707	10/31/11	A good guy who knows the material. I knew nothing about programming until I took his class. Very clear in explanations. Class is very easy if you show up and pay attention. Does take a while to give back assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering	343	3	3	3	5	1413707	10/11/11	He has a hard time getting work back on time so you don't know how you are really doing in the class until it might be too late, but he has a lot of students work to grade. If you just go to his office hours the class is enjoyable and easy I like him a lot as a teacher!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	0	Engineering		4	1	3	3	1413707	2/15/11	I haven't gotten any of my work back until week 10, so I had no idea that I was doing something wrong on the problems the entire quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering		5	2	3	2	1413707	2/2/11	Terrible at handing back work.. Gives a policy for how homework is graded, but doesn't grade the homework himself; The TA grades the work without following what the prof said. Quizzes are easy if you read the book. Posts when his office hours are, but often arrives there late. I hope he's better for Problem Solving with Computers
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering		4	2	3	3	1413707	1/6/11	Not good at returning graded work, some discrepancy between classwork and book definitions. Quizzes are easy, extra credit for answering questions during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering		5	5	4	4	1413707	8/21/10	I had professor Humphrey for Materials Science Lab for the 20094 quarter. The lab was very easy going. Professor Humphrey was very clear and easy to approach if you needed help/more info. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering		4	2	3	3	1413707	11/7/12	Cool guy, if you go to class you will do fine. It takes him forever to hand back work so you won't have a clue what your grade is going to be till week 11.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering		4	4	3	3	1413707	11/10/11	Just pay attention in class, and maybe watch the videos and you'll do fine. Takes awhile to hand back work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering		3	2	4	1	1413707	10/26/11	He is an okay professor, he just teaches a course that I can't stand. He has daily one question quizzes, he does not hand work back until right before the exams. Has a grader grade all of the work. Great guy, not so great professor. I'd give him a 6 out of 10 for teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	1	Engineering		2	2	3	3	1413707	4/30/11	Awful, avoid at all costs. He has potential to be a good teacher, but he is so lazy and so hard to meet up with to ask questions. He never grades anything until week 10 and takes points off for stupid things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	0	Engineering		2	1	2	1	1413707	2/13/11	Awful teacher. He ate pizza once at the beginning of his lecture while teaching. Never gets any work back graded until the very end of the quarter when finals are done so you can't argue the grade. This guy is the laziest teacher I have ever seen. Lost 15 points on a lab for "format" and nothing else. All the content and everything was correct.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	0	Engineering		3	1	2	3	1413707	1/31/11	He shows up regardless of the weather. But if you think you're going to get /anything/ back, good luck. It's the 8th week, I haven't received any work back, and I stopped getting grades all together after the 5th week (participation points). Multiple people have emailed him, he just doesn't grade ANYTHING. Fun fact, he sounds EXACTLY like Kermit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Humphrey	2.9	2	Engineering	343	4	3	4	4	1413707	11/30/10	Had for Materials Processing. Seemed to teach pretty clear. He is unorganized, doesn't get things graded and returned. Example, during finals week he had 1/5 quizzes graded and posted that had been taken throughout the quarter. He blows it off when brought up and says that he is going to be grading in his office right after class, but doesn't do it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	0	Engineering		1	1	2	4	13602	3/6/13	DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	0	Engineering		3	2	1	3	13602	8/14/08	Not a good teacher if you need someone who is great at explianing himself. He doesn't do a good job of TEACHING even though that's what he there for. He knows his stuff but doesn't know how to convey his knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	2	13602	10/2/07	Great teacher. Had him for Electronics 1. (0609-360) Encourages students comments and questions and does a great job of answering questions. Only good teacher I have had throughout the Electronics series.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	0	Engineering		1	2	1	4	13602	1/15/05	Unable to teach on a level below his, and terribly unclear. Very poor professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	13602	8/28/01	Very helpful professor. If you have a chance, I suggest taking a class from him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	0	Engineering		1	1	1	5	13602	9/12/10	his version of teaching our class was to tell us how we were all bad students, sorry, "professionals in training" and needed to know the material without him to "hold [our] hands"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	1	Engineering		3	3	3	4	13602	5/23/08	He is a good guy but not cut out to teach others. He knows his stuff but can't teach to under his level unless you ask A LOT of questions. If you go to his office hours and ask him questions about what you need help with he will eventually get to a point where you can understand. It is hard to understand material from his lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	0	Engineering		2	1	1	2	13602	9/19/05	Can't frickin teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Hurny	2.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	13602	12/10/02	Had Prof. Hurney when he was an adjunct. Great teacher that actually motivates!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia  Iglesias	5.0	2	Engineering	336	4	5	5	4	1754738	10/17/12	Dr. Iglesias is one of the best professors I have had. She is very enthusiastic about what she teaches and she spends a lot of class time working out example problems on the board. She is helpful during office hours and makes sure you understand everything. She truly cares about your success in the class. Had her for statics. Definitely take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Illingsworth	2.8	2	Science		3	4	3	5	67468	4/25/11	helpful but his lip smacking can be like a drill entering your brain. otherwise pretty good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Illingsworth	2.8	2	Science		3	4	4	3	67468	11/9/05	Smacks his lips every 6 seconds... loudly. Wanted to jam a pen into my eye by the end of class for the first couple weeks. Otherwise not too bad
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Illingsworth	2.8	0	Science		3	3	1	3	67468	11/9/05	Very boring. I swear this teacher smokes up before teaching class. I want to jam a pencil in my eye every time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marvin Illingsworth	2.8	0	Science		3	2	1	4	67468	9/28/05	Boring... unclear... monotonous. But I can catch up on my sleep in class at least. Nice guy, though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	13603	3/4/13	The best instructor ever. Very helpful, tests are fair, final is fair, grading is good. Knows what he is talking about. Will take classes with him as long as i can. Recommend him for sure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	722	4	5	4	4	13603	11/7/11	Good professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	722	3	5	4	3	13603	8/12/11	I agree with many of the other comments. He is a bit disorganized, but he is by far the best online prof in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	271	5	5	3	4	13603	9/9/10	Good instructor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	0	Engineering	465	3	2	2	4	13603	4/22/10	Avoid him. He does know telecom staff, but he cannot teach at all. Looks nice, but in reality he is not. Would not recommend him. He makes easy material very difficult. Very messy and disorganized. He is not a hard grader, but if you want to learn something for your major, try to avoid him. There are much better professors on Telecom department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	13603	12/10/02	Mark is an easy going guy. More like a friend than teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	101	4	5	5	4	13603	2/15/13	Great Professor with great clarity and Passion for networking related courses. FYI amazing personality.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	13603	10/2/11	amazing guy... i will do my project under him very soon... but he is an excellent teacher...teaches whatever is relevant to today's world....doesnt teach **** like odr professors...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	722	4	4	3	3	13603	4/21/11	The department's best online professor. While he is somewhat disorganized in lectures, given the medium, he does a great job. I wish the other instructors were more like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering	271	5	5	3	4	13603	8/12/10	You will get out of the class what you put into it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering		2	4	3	1	13603	5/21/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Indelicato	4.2	2	Engineering		3	5	4	NULL	13603	8/28/01	Great guy all around...even better professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Morton Isaacs	4.3	2	Psychology		3	5	5	3	774866	11/5/09	Excellent teacher :) He is so nice and he really is quite helpful. He is also very understanding and caring with all of his students. I took his online abnormal psych class. The class was a lot of work, but if you are going to college you should be expecting to do a lot of work! Highly recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Morton Isaacs	4.3	0	Psychology	447	1	1	2	1	774866	10/19/08	Childhood Adolescent development. Useless class, useless teacher. If you don't agree with his opinion you will find yourself with a terrible grade. TAKE ANOTHER CLASS AND INSTRUCTOR!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Morton Isaacs	4.3	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	774866	2/24/06	I took this as an online course and it was more demanding than any on campus course I've ever taken. I also learned way more too. He is very sharp and constantly involved in the class. Highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Morton Isaacs	4.3	2	Psychology	442	3	5	5	4	774866	10/24/08	Really good teacher. Don't be fooled by it being an online course: it's A LOT of work from readings, essays, discussions, and videos. You learn a lot though, and he is really there to help you so always ask if you need help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Morton Isaacs	4.3	2	Psychology		3	5	4	4	774866	12/26/07	Prof Isaacs is a very smart and helpful man. He takes great interest in all of his students. He is also very sensible and logical. He knows quite a bit and has experienced quite a bit, and shares a lot of that in this class. The class itself takes some work and some discipline, but Prof. Isaacs is there to help you through it all.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Howard	4.8	2	Science	401	2	4	5	3	9111	5/14/08	GREAT teacher. knows what she is talking about. very knowledgeable. very flexible with class discussions. humorous and motherly like characteristics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Howard	4.8	2	Science		5	5	5	NULL	9111	5/27/01	Great teacher. Good teaching style.Listens and knows her stuff! Shes great!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering	560	2	1	1	1	1104331	2/25/13	Hsu is useless and hard to understand. This course is a hodge-podge which you don't even need to understand- just make a REALLY good cheat sheet and you'll get an A on the midterm and final. This is coming from someone who stopped attending lecture and got an A. Oh, and don't do the Freescale car- you will get a lower grade after more time working.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering	341	2	2	2	4	1104331	5/18/12	Very difficult to understand. Almost all the material I learned I got from the labs. Be prepared to teach yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	1	Engineering	341	5	3	3	1	1104331	10/2/11	super easy prof, gives a lot of extra credit!!! Get it!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering	101	2	1	1	4	1104331	1/29/10	Intro. to Dig. Systems. Heavy accent, extra help nearly useless, can't teach well at all, especially K-maps. Passed only because of lab TA, who had to teach all of Hsu's students how to do the labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering	999	2	1	2	2	1104331	1/28/09	As far as I know, the only professor that teaches Interface to Digital Electronics. Do not take any other courses with him if you can help it. Boring, course is irrelevant and unhelpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering	341	2	2	1	4	1104331	5/18/12	Love the textbook, it is your greatest ally. Lectures are almost completely useless, but better go anyway because he usually won't announce quizzes ahead of time. You get a cheat sheet for the midterm and final, so that's good. Quizzes are not hard if you know it, so don't sweat. Always talk to him after quizzes, you can usually get more points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	1	Engineering	560	3	2	3	4	1104331	11/9/11	Good Professor, intends well and wants students to succeed, but the lectures are worthless. You can use a cheat sheet for the midterm and final though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering		3	1	2	3	1104331	4/8/10	Avoid at all cost, unless you know the topic well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Hsu	1.7	0	Engineering		5	2	1	5	1104331	5/27/09	Hsu is an easy grader, and gives a lot of extra credit. He allows a cheat sheet on the midterm and final, and drops the lowest quiz grade. He just is not good at explaining things. He spends a lot of time explaining and repeating simple material, and barely touches higher material.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Seth Hubbard	5.0	2	Engineering	101	3	5	5	5	872689	8/7/06	Seth is the best professor to walk the face of the planet -- jump through any hoop you can to get in his class. Extremely smart guy who can break things down in simple terms. Ask him about quantum dots in the intrinsic layer of GaAs solar cells for brownie points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	2	Writing	277	4	5	5	3	808316	12/1/11	Good professor, had a lot of stimulating conversations with him and hes an absolute wealth of information. Helped me pick up some essay topics and where to start, class is sorta boring... But that's to be expected, but this guy made it much much better, you can tell he actually enjoys helping you, and he wants you to become a better writer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	2	Writing		5	5	5	3	808316	10/9/08	Good teacher. My class is real easy, it's just writing about the upcoming presidential debate. But conservative comments/viewpoints make him a little shifty. Cool guy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	0	Writing		3	1	2	5	808316	5/24/07	If you don't write what he doesn't enjoy reading (mystery/crime) then you won't get a good grade. Wants everybody to add a thrill into their story (not alwas possible depending on what your form) and never understands where you are going with an idea, no matter how many times you explain it. He annoyed me all quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	2	Writing	227	4	4	4	3	808316	6/7/09	Good professor. We had to write 3 essays, the last one ended up being our final, so we didn't even have an actual final. I thought he graded very fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	2	Writing		5	4	4	4	808316	7/3/07	huff is the man, laid back, listens to your ideas, good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Huff	4.1	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	808316	2/6/06	Very laid back and makes the class interesting. Lets you go anywhere with your writing and the format of the class is also comfortable for people who are not used to sharing their work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	1	Business		2	4	2	2	345925	2/22/13	Oh my was it challenging not the content of the class but what was expected was not always clear. My advice, take really really good notes (he doesnt use powerpoint or even write things on the board) and ask questions. Do not wait until the last week to write the final because you will forget everything you thought you knew but didnt actually learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	2	Business		2	4	3	2	345925	5/24/08	Great guy and thought provoking professor. Seems to really care about students learning and professional development. Attendance is integral to success in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	2	Business		4	4	3	4	345925	10/15/07	Good professor, a bit hard to understand what we're actually trying to accomplish. He does encourage the class to speak, but he has A LOT to say as well. Definitely an interesting class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	2	Business		3	4	5	4	345925	11/20/04	even though his class was sorta boring, dr. hull rules! only a few kids spoke in his class, either he didn't encourage them all to speak, or they were a bunch of arse hats. either way, if you ever hang with him outside of class, he's the coolest guy ever and has tons of stories about iceland!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	0	Business		2	2	1	3	345925	11/10/11	The professor made me want to drink.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	2	Business		2	5	5	3	345925	3/19/08	One of the best! I've been graduated for 4 years now and he's still an extremely helpful resource. Very genuine and top notch!!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Clyde Hull	3.9	2	Business		2	5	5	3	345925	10/21/04	Awesome prof best course in college of buisness ever (well ethics in tech env was great too). Would highly recommend, made class very entertaining!! Allowed entire class to comment even encouraged it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics	312	5	1	2	5	780547	11/14/07	Poor professor; dull, repetitive, and not always accurate. He won't teach you all that much and while he might compensate with an easy exam, you won't take alot out of the class. (This was the first class I ever got 147% on an exam).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	780547	5/26/06	Sucks... Pied piper of physics, puts everyone to sleep. Doesn't teach, sits on his stoold and repeats his notes onto his projector. Lousy "teacher" but that can be said for most physics teachers at RIT. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		2	1	1	4	780547	2/28/06	This guy rarley answers emails, if you ask him a qustion the usual response is "what do YOU think it is?" which obviously does not help. things done in class are never looked at again. notes are useless. class is pretty much useless. if you've signed up for him, be prepared to attempt to teach yourself everything. DONT SIGN UP FOR HUNTE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		2	1	2	3	780547	1/25/06	I wish you guys had posted sooner. This dude sucks... a lot. He never grades or goes over our homework or in-class stuff and the TA seems to know much more than him... or at least the TA's more helpful and gets straight to the point instead of wasting TONS of class time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		3	1	1	2	780547	12/14/05	Terrible professor, very hands off teaching style. SPEEDs through notes, but it doesn't matter, they are also terrible. NEVER went over work we did in class. Doesn't help in office hours and rarely could get straight answers from him. If you are not naturally good at physics you will do poorly. Though tests were usually fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		3	2	2	1	780547	1/12/07	Boring. He LOVES vector notation and will say "i-hat, j-hat... " to excess. Makes you want to bring ear-plugs. He's nice, but no amount of caffeine will make his lectures interesting. Not worth taking. Avoid him unless you HAVE to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		3	2	2	5	780547	4/27/06	Bad teacher. He isn't even listed as a professor, he is technically a "lecturer". (w/e that means) Terribly boring, and an uncomfortable guy to be around. Answers questions horribly, I actually don't think I've recieved an answer from him that has actually helped yet. You need to know physics prior to taking this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		3	2	2	3	780547	1/25/06	I agree with the below comments- he is not very clear and class is dreadfully boring. He should go over previous assignments better. Tests are fair enough, though. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franke Hunte	1.4	0	Physics		2	1	1	3	780547	1/25/06	Avoid if you want to learn anything. Class is horrificly boring, notes are useless, responses to questions- pathetic, if any. Monotone all the time. Only inflection comes when he says "i hat" and "j hat", otherwise it is just a droning babble of uselessness. The book for the class is quite poor, too [free online usage with WebAssign subscription].
Rochester Institute of Technology	Emmett Ientilucci	5.0	2	Imaging Science	370	2	5	5	3	1446286	5/18/11	Great lecturer. Effective homeworks. Tests are fair. The class portion is great; however, the labs take far too long for you not to be getting any credit for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Iglesias-Cardinale	4.8	2	Writing	398	5	4	4	4	287549	3/12/12	Online Web Design II - Great professor, facilitates learning on your own well. Weekly assignments from online textbooks through RIT library. Not overly complicated if you have a decent background with programming. Big part of grade comes from myCourses discussions. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Iglesias-Cardinale	4.8	2	Writing		4	5	5	3	287549	3/8/08	I had this professor for a distance learning course. Very friendly and competent. Checks on students to keep them on track and participates in discussions enthusiastically. Answers e-mail very promptly. I hope to have another course with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Iglesias-Cardinale	4.8	2	Writing	361	4	5	5	2	287549	8/14/11	Awesome professor. Very clear directions and expectations. Very organized and thorough. Great for an online class. Never had him in person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Iglesias-Cardinale	4.8	2	Writing		2	5	5	NULL	287549	8/31/04	Very thorough and helpful: he is a great teacher! Take his courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	482378	3/17/13	She is really good in explaining the complex terminology and had very good style to presenting hard topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	482378	3/3/13	I had a long ago, but it was very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	482378	3/3/13	She is knows her subject
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	1	Philosophy		2	4	1	5	482378	9/28/05	Cannot possibly understand this professor. Her accent is SO strong that I had to withdraw from the class. And HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE HER DAMN NAME?1?!?!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	1	Philosophy		3	4	1	3	482378	10/29/04	She's very sweet but VERY hard to understand due to her accent and poor command of the English language. She really cares about her students, though, and wants to make sure they comprehend the material. I'm convinced in her native language, she'd be a wonderful teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	482378	3/3/13	i enjoed the materials, desire to learn, interest in sbject and discussions, instructor knowledge and feedback was excellent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	482378	3/3/13	She is an excellent teacher! I love her style of teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	482378	3/3/13	She is very good!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Odinposha Imamkhodjaeva	4.1	0	Philosophy		3	3	1	2	482378	11/4/04	She's nice... but EXTEREMLY hard to understand. She also seems to be disorganized, probably because she's not used to American standards of papers and our exact expectations that we have
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Ingrassio	4.5	2	Physical Education		3	5	5	4	1281975	10/21/10	Awesome instructor. Keeps you motivated while still making class fun. She always has funny stuff to talk about and relates to students extremely well. I have taken six spinning classes with her so far and will continue to do so as long as I can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Ingrassio	4.5	2	Physical Education		2	4	4	5	1281975	10/20/10	Great spin instructor! Challenging for all ranges. I came into the class with a broad knowledge and she deepened understanding. Good class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology	387	2	3	2	3	828854	1/30/13	He doesn't give detailed explanations when they are needed. He jumps from topic to topic at a blink of an eye.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology		3	3	2	2	828854	10/24/12	He's a nice guy, and actually quite smart. He'll also generally explain stuff more than one way. However, he's a bit confusing, and unless you already have some prior knowledge before going in, you'll need to REALLY pay attention, and outside learning on top of his teaching is greatly advised.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		4	2	2	1	828854	11/9/11	He's a very very nice guy, but he's really quite confusing. I don't mind taking him again, but it requires a lot of work outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	2	828854	5/12/11	Jay Alan Jackson is a horrible teacher. He took everything I knew about the subject and destroyed it. He actually wiped knowledge clean from my brain. He is a nice guy, but I don't know why he has a job here. AVOID AT ALL COST.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology		3	3	3	2	828854	1/27/11	Jackson is always passionate about what he talks about and sometimes cracks nerdy jokes which can sometimes be funny. i took him for discrete math II at 6 at night and there were always a few people that were asleep
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		3	1	1	3	828854	5/10/10	If you like teaching yourself programming languages, being given online quizzes without being told of their existence, and doing lots of hard work only fail out of later classes because you weren't taught half of the things you were expected to know, then you'll LOVE Professor Jackson.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	5	828854	2/24/10	This guy is the worst teacher ever, I honestly think that he wings his lectures and doesn't know what he is going to say before he walks in. For many of the subjects he just threw some code on the projector said a few words about it not really explaining it and said play around with it and he is of no help as far as question, he tries to guilt you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology	330	1	1	1	2	828854	12/1/09	I took him for Interactive Digital Media(using Adobe Flash). Worst professor at RIT. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. He gets frustrated with you when you don't understand what he's saying. He doesn't show you how to do anything, you're expected to somehow pick it up on your own. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology	101	4	3	3	4	828854	11/5/07	A fun teacher, always throwing in a joke, though many go over everyone's heads. His quizzes are a little hard, but if the majority of the class does badly he'll give everyone a second chance or some sort of compensation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology	320	5	2	2	2	828854	5/31/07	The assignments in class were easy but the online assignments could get a little tricky. Generally went over EVERYTHING, even did some quizzes in class on with you. Easy A. Got off track easily and didnt seem to be an expert at his subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		4	1	1	4	828854	12/17/12	He seems like a nice guy, but he is the last thing from a good professor. He taught straight out of the text, which was an introduction book(despite the class being the 3rd course in a programming sequence). Also, he dragged everything out and was very unwilling to change his teaching methods. Also, on his exams, he tested us on variable names.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		3	2	2	3	828854	9/24/12	He teaches out of the book verbatim. The book used this year is for people who've never touched a computer before, even though this is Programming III, and thus is pretty long winded, yet he manages to drag it out further. He doesn't let you leave class early because "I have to be here so you do too" even though there's only ~45 mins of content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology	101	4	1	2	4	828854	11/9/11	Took him for Discreet Math for Technicians 1. If you're good at math and have basic programming knowledge, he's a good teacher because he grades super easily. If math is not your strong suit, I suggest a different teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	3	828854	5/11/11	before I say anything,I just wanna say that Jay is a nice guy. And thats about the only good thing i can say. He should not be teaching. He makes simple things confusing, hes boring, and he just straight up doesnt know how to teach. He rarely gives us examples and just does math on the board.Then he gets pissed when we're confused.AVOID AT ALL COST
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology		4	4	2	3	828854	10/22/10	I had Jackson for Discrete Math for Tech. 1, in a night class. Jackson's a good guy. You can tell he likes math, and he likes to make jokes to keep you listening. He'll also end class early if he's done teaching which is nice. That being said, he is a bland lecturer, and you'll need to follow along with Google and the notes to do well in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology	206	2	1	1	3	828854	3/3/10	I had this instructor for Discrete Math 1, Horrible professor. He fails to convey even the simplest concepts and over-complicates everything. AVOID. Had to end up teaching everything to myself mainly because he had horrible on board notes, exam and quiz grades were disgusting, and confusion was palpable on everyone's face during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	2	Information Technology	330	3	4	4	5	828854	1/20/10	I don't doubt that Jackson knows what he is doing, but he is another professor that knows the material and can't relay it in a meaningful manner. I learned a lot about flash and actionscript in the class, but if you don't have prior programming experience you may struggle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	1	Information Technology		5	4	2	3	828854	10/22/08	While he does tangent from the topic material it is made up with witty and some times odd jokes. He is great if you dont know what your doing, because he is very thorough going through things, and takes his time during demonstrations. If your already good at the subject, you'll get bored, but he'll discuss more advanced things after class if u want
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	4	828854	10/24/07	Professor Jackson throws in some quirkiness and wierd ways to teach things.. i.e. "festival fridays" but he is wicked smart and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	2	Information Technology	206	4	4	3	4	828854	10/25/06	Though he may get off topic sometimes, and is commonly jumping all over the whiteboard, he is very comical and entertaining. He's given our class a lot of breaks, not to mention many easy quizzes and homeworks to make up for our bad grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Alan Jackson	2.2	0	Information Technology		2	3	1	2	828854	5/16/06	He jump all over the place with his lecture and does not get to the point directly. He know his Java stuff but does not teach it well. However he is better than other Java professsor in all aspect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Jackson	4.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	409968	11/20/09	Excellent teacher and more than willing to answering questions. You have to send him an email and set up an appointment before you go to his office for help, because he is a busy guy. Quizzes and Exams are not hard if you attend class and take notes. I plan to take more classes with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Jackson	4.2	2	Engineering		4	4	3	NULL	409968	5/16/04	very untimely about returning graded work and getting lab data to students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	0	Packaging Science		3	2	2	3	401535	12/12/12	Tests were difficult. Make sure you write own everything that comes out of her mouth cause it mostly likely be on the test. She loves what she does so its nice to see her enthusiasm.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	1	Packaging Science	312	2	3	2	1	401535	3/5/12	tests are impossible even if you study all night, lab TA didnt know what she was doing and everything wasnt graded until the last day that the grades were due and the grades still werent up until the next day. Boring class and does not teach the material just reads off slides... Tests were short answer and there are alot of useless T/F questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	1	Packaging Science		3	2	3	3	401535	8/21/08	some test questions can be very unclear..known to be stubborn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	2	Packaging Science		3	3	4	4	401535	8/13/06	she aight...make sure u take note of every word she says
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	0	Packaging Science		2	2	2	4	401535	3/2/06	she has an arrogant attitude and attempts to 'motivate' by demeaning students and being condescending. Tests are written ambiguously and require specific answers. Interrupts students questions to answer them in a rude "No" VERY untimely in handing back labs and homework especially for someone who demands timeliness. Means well but misses the mark
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	1	Packaging Science		2	3	2	4	401535	11/18/05	Her teaching style needs a major improvement. She needs to make the students more interested in the material as time goes by.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	2	Packaging Science		1	4	3	3	401535	6/16/05	Tough tests, and the lateness policy sucks. But she is a good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	1	Packaging Science		2	3	3	NULL	401535	5/4/04	Maybe its just the class, but Im not having a great experience so far. Her tests are hard and long, mostly short answer with some multiple choice. Dont be late to her class. Only allows drinks, not food.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	1	Packaging Science		1	2	3	3	401535	9/4/12	Be sure to read the textbook... that is my only advice!! the answer will not be give in class. Test are impossible if you don't read, Bottom line do well in the lab to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	2	Packaging Science		4	5	4	3	401535	11/28/10	Her tests are fair and she does a good job teaching the material. However, she's not someone to curve, so don't try for that 88 and hope for an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	2	Packaging Science		1	5	5	5	401535	3/10/08	Her tests are difficult but not impossible. Make sure you take detailed notes. Her teaching style is different, but all of her examples are straight from industry experience. Overall I enjoyed this professor's class and looked forward to going to it. Tests should require "specific answers" for obvious reasons.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	0	Packaging Science		2	2	2	4	401535	6/8/06	had a hard time learning the material. wasn't motivated at all to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	2	Packaging Science		2	4	4	5	401535	2/3/06	Loved having Prof J. for Principles and for Materials 2. She geniunely cares about her students, you just have to work hard and be a diligent student. She likes it if you seek her out for help and talk to her. And participating will also be good. Watch out for cell phones, and drinks only in class. Don't be late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deanna Jacobs	2.9	0	Packaging Science		4	1	1	3	401535	8/29/05	Department allows this queen bee to rest on her laurels and be complacent. Aparently the dean doesn't believe in the "publish or perish" theory because she hasn't published one thing. Rather ironic for a department head...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Jacobs	2.7	2	Information Technology		4	4	4	5	240786	9/5/10	Was great for GDD1 was critical of some project ideas but only because the students didn't take time to really research or pitch game correctly. Lots of reading, sure but often draws exam questions straight from the main ideas of the passages not the little details. Easy exams as long as you mildly pay attention
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Jacobs	2.7	0	Information Technology	380	2	1	1	2	240786	5/15/10	While I understand Game Design is a new and upcoming field, that should be no excuse to teach it like one. We were required to buy 4 textbooks; one was barely referenced on the exams. He procrastinated grading. He cancelled class twice (one time 14 minutes before class). His lectures have little focus. Do yourself a favor and avoid this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Jacobs	2.7	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	NULL	240786	8/21/03	Oh yea, Jacobs is the man!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Jacobs	2.7	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	5	240786	5/18/10	Often too critical about student ideas and projects. Canceled class FIVE minutes before it started (8am class) TWICE. Horrible communication skills and is often biased towards women.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Jacobs	2.7	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	1	240786	5/27/06	More work than any other HCI section. Assigned overed 300 pages of reading material on the 7th week!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	305	5	5	2	3	1345578	1/28/13	Very easy teacher. Gives you a practice exam before each test which is almost identical to the test. Only problem is she is a little hard to understand. Other than that the class is an easy A if you do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1345578	10/24/12	One of the best calc teachers I've come across, extremely helpful and her review sheets strongly reflect the tests

Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	1345578	1/31/12	You'll warm up to her accent within two or three weeks. She's a really fair grader and a good teacher. Take her class if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	5	5	4	3	1345578	10/14/11	Basca is a really great professor. Homework and quizzes every week. Gives solutions to everything and is willing to answer hw questions in class. Tests were fair. Just pay attention and do the work and an A is not hard to get!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	1345578	4/7/11	One of the nicest professors at RIT. I thoroughly enjoyed having her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	5	5	5	5	1345578	12/4/10	Basca is amazing! You only use the textbook for homework, everything she she teaches and explains to you herself. She answers any question you ask her efficiently, and she is always happy and smiling. Hands down the best calc teacher at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	4	5	5	4	1345578	8/6/10	Very helpful, easy grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1345578	1/23/13	She is the best professor. I absolutely loved her she is very easy her exams are fair. She gives out a practice one and if you do it you'll get an A on every exam. She'e so nice. She made the most difficult subject easy. I actually waited for her to come back from having a baby to take her in the spring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	283	5	4	4	3	1345578	5/10/12	Basca is very helpful and a very easy grader. The course is tough, but she explains everything well enough to help you on the final. Definitely take her if you can. One of the best math teachers RIT has to offer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	1345578	3/5/12	She is the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1345578	2/26/12	Basca is the best calc teacher I have ever had. She is a very fair grader, is always eager to help you understand during workshops. She is easy to understand and you are sure to get an A as long as you do the work and come to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	2	1345578	2/1/12	I Really feel like giving her many terrible ratings, because with the current round of registration she filled up fast. This woman is a wonderful teacher and you shoud take her class, especially if you hate powerpoint
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	1345578	11/3/11	Extremely helpful, an easy class to get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	1345578	4/28/11	Basca is the hidden gem of RIT. No one registers for her classes because they are usually 8am, but she is THE best calculus teacher at RIT. At first she can be difficult to understand, but after a few days you get used to her accent. She is always willing to help you if you dont understand and is very fair with grading. Take her class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	4	4	1345578	1/28/11	Professor Jadamba is fantastic! I have taken her for calc 1 and 2, and am rearranging my class schedule to have her for calc 3 next quarter. She assigns one hw a week, one quiz a week, and two-three exams per quarter. Her workshop questions relate very well to the quiz/exam questions, and she gives plenty of help if you need it. Take her classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	4	1345578	11/23/10	Some claimed she was hard to understand; I had no trouble. Fair grader, drops lowest homework and quiz grade at end of quarter. Homeworks assigned every class, minus exams. Exams were fair (lots of partial credit); just show up to class and do the work (problems from textbook). No reason to not get an A if you moderately try. Very nice professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics	211	3	5	5	3	1345578	1/22/10	Very helpful. Gives detailed solutions, review sheets, etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	3	3	1345578	1/21/10	Heavy accent. Lots of questions asked were lost in translation. She had a tendency to write her 9 as a g. Had to teach myself out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Basca Jadamba	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	1345578	10/29/09	Very, very sweet and helpful professor. Always available if you need help outside of class. Lectures very organized, clear and logical. Everything presented in a perfect order. Loved the class :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing		4	5	5	4	1629967	2/17/13	Awesome professor. Very laid back and a lot of freedom on the final paper. Great in class discussions. Great in class format overall. Grades are lenient, but also fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	1629967	11/14/12	Amazing teacher. Second time having her. I took her class and it was very interesting. The best part was I had it 8am and I did not drift to sleep once! Myth, very interesting stuff. Assignments are fair, grades fairly, papers to write, lots of reading but overall fun class! I highly recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing	101	4	5	5	3	1629967	5/22/12	Amazing professor. Really helpful and a pretty easy class. All assignments have really loose topics and are relatively short. Highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing		5	5	5	1	1629967	10/23/11	Shelly is actually a good professor. Writing is probably one of the more boring classes out there in my opinion but the papers she has us due are very accessible by students. We can actually write about things that affect us personally. She is a great teacher overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing	319	4	5	5	3	1629967	11/15/12	Very laid back class, lots of room for individual interpretation of the course content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing		4	4	5	3	1629967	5/24/12	Very easy going professor. She makes the class interesting with thought provoking discussion. Participation will make this class more enjoyable. Fair grader as long as you follow the criteria. Highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shelly Jansen	4.9	2	Writing		5	5	5	1	1629967	10/31/11	Make writing seminar fun. What else can you say. Grades most assignments on completion. You can show up late with no penalty.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Jean-Jacques	1.8	0	Psychology	210	3	1	2	4	1191832	1/23/09	Unprofessional and clueless. I don't normally dislike a teacher, but this one really had no clue what she was doing. The lectures consist of her reading from slides, resulting in zero comprehension from students. When students posed questions to her, she seldom even knew what they were asking, let alone answered them correctly. Big mistake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Jean-Jacques	1.8	0	Psychology	210	3	1	3	1	1191832	10/27/08	Lectures all the time, no student participation, reads from the book, gives extra credit, answers questions (when she notices), might as well read from the book like her, no homework, one paper. For the few kids who like to show off, she'll take the bait, so if you're an attention-monger you'll do well. Otherwise, just lay low and wait for the end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1404373	3/28/13	Excellent teacher. Doesn't look at the students in the eyes, but he is very concise and clear with articulating the information. Very kind and helpful and makes class material interesting!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics	319	3	4	4	5	1404373	3/1/12	Professor Jehle is great to take for Data Analysis I. Get ready to work though!! He gives the work load of a 6 credit class and its only a 4. Amazing in lecture. Final was pretty unfair and unbalanced with the whole years material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1404373	2/13/12	Very good professor. He was very clear and helpful throughout the entire course. He was willing to extend the deadlines for homework if you needed it and posted guides to the minitab projects for people who weren't familiar with the program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1404373	9/23/11	Taught material very well and effectively. Created excellent slideshows which were provided online. He was very fair, helpful, and energetic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	4	4	1404373	5/12/10	Data Analysis I. 1016-319. great professor, very energetic, sometimes too energetic. very helpful, tests are fair, lectures are boring though. HW is all webassign, but you dont need the book, just an access code. several minitab assignments, but he posts a guide if you arent familiar with the program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	1404373	2/5/10	Very helpful and fair teacher.Teaches the material so that it is very understandable. Homework is not mandatory and is counted as extra credit if done. Flexible with extra help hours and allows test and quizzes to be made up. Very nice guy with lots of energy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	1404373	3/4/12	What a guy! honestly at first look at the syllabus I was hesitant, but this guys is by far the best data1 teacher at RIT. Great professor, great guy, and extremely helpful. I had a few issues that I was unable to attend class and exams, and he had no problem rescheduling to allow to do well in his class. Take his class!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	1	Mathematics		4	4	2	2	1404373	2/14/12	If you have to take Data 1 this is the guy to take it with. However, his lecture are mandatory and do nothing but confuse you. He stands in front of the room for two hours going over power points just shouting out number and equations. He is not good at presenting the material. However if you need extensions for hw he will help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics	230	4	5	2	4	1404373	11/28/11	Made good slides but was very difficult to understand when explaining the material during class. Very willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	3	1404373	2/1/11	Very good professor. Enjoyed taking precalc with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Jehle	4.4	2	Mathematics	214	2	5	5	4	1404373	5/11/10	I had him for Calc 1. He is an awesome teacher. He makes it so that you understand everything. His door is always open. But he is a fair teacher as well. I would definetly take one of his classes again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	3	1385957	3/8/13	He was an ok teacher. I felt like i understood the material in class, but the tests and quizzes are hard. The workshops are quite difficult as well. he's a nice person, but also a pretty hard grader. He gave minimal to no partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1385957	2/21/12	He is good teacher explain everything well. super organize his material. very nice guy. take with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	1385957	11/3/11	Homeworks graded harshly. Weekly quizzes. Overall a pretty good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	2	1385957	3/9/11	Accent is tough at first, grades the homework strictly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1385957	3/8/10	Good math professor. Gives many examples and makes sure that there are no questions before moving on to new material. Very patient and helpful. Gives very little homework; just enough to make sure that you understand the material. Also added a very nice curve to the grade at the end of the quarter, very fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	0	Mathematics	467	1	2	2	3	1385957	4/14/12	Home work and exam are really hard. some homework problem are not even cover in class. Not clear explanation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	5	5	1385957	2/14/12	he is good professor, everything explain clearly. nice professor. take with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	1	Mathematics	265	2	4	2	2	1385957	10/28/11	Accent tough first week, but once you get to used it, no problem. Grades the homework a bit rough, but it doesn't count for too much. Quiz once a week, but very basic - helps you stay current. Does tons of examples and speaks in easy-to-understand language. Will not move on until the entire class is ready to. Will take again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	3	1385957	12/15/10	Awesome professor. His accent is a bit tricky, but once you get used to it he's really nice and very understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Jobby	3.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	1385957	2/26/10	Avoid at all cost...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature		4	1	1	3	923641	9/20/12	She is useless. She is like a recorder who only repeats the rubric if you ask her a question about the essay. Also she gives the students a false sense of confidence. This confidence will shatter when you get your grade. Do yourself a favor and take the normal writing seminar. This class isn't worth the honors points...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature		1	1	1	3	923641	5/21/12	Such a bad choice for a writing teacher. She seems nice in person but there are writing teachers who teach a lot better and give better grades. Thanks for the C...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	1	Literature	502	4	4	2	5	923641	2/8/12	she doesnt make it clear on what she wants in her essays but you are allowed to revise them. over all easy class. nice person. easy A if you do your work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		5	5	5	4	923641	10/25/11	Go to class, do the work, get an A. Very nice person too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		4	5	4	3	923641	10/25/10	Fun teacher, always has a cheerful smile on her face. Class is quite easy, as long as you do the work and participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		5	2	5	3	923641	5/5/10	Easy professor, easy assignments. Read the assignments, talk in class, write the two papers = A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	1	Literature		3	3	2	1	923641	1/26/10	This class computer games and ethics is one of the boring class I have had in college. She is really strict about paper and participating in class discussions. For the group presentation we had an article from MSNBC and she denied it due to it not being a scholarly article. I don't recommend taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	1	Literature	319	4	3	3	1	923641	2/4/09	This professor is more focused on how we write papers and develop thoughts than she is on the content. That doesn't bother me, however, since the class is on Computer Games/Ethics (shoot me now). She never makes eye contact with you. Instead, she constantly stares at the ceiling. What's up there?!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature	101	2	5	5	5	923641	6/16/08	Julie is an excellent teacher, as long as you are willing to put in the effort she requires. If you want a class where you can slack off, she is not the teacher for you. However, she is extremely nice if you show her that you are making a considerable effort in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature	101	3	5	5	4	923641	3/7/08	Great Teacher, I enjoyed her class thoroughly. She is a little hard on grading but its worth it with how much my writing has improved.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		3	5	5	4	923641	5/23/12	Had her for AE:Computer Games, easily the best writing professor I ever had!! For this class there is a lot of reading, some of it can be dull, however you dont need a book! She is clear on assignments and what she expects. She allows a paper rewrite if you desire a better grade. In total there are 2 papers, 2 presentations and class discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		4	5	5	3	923641	5/17/12	Very helpful and gives you good recomendations when you need help with an eassay. VEry nice person and cheerful. Go to class and do work you'll have an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		4	4	4	4	923641	11/13/11	No textbooks need to be purchased for her classes; they are all online, which is awesome on my wallet. Class is mostly discussion based. Basically go to class, read the readings,talk in class and write the papers = easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature		1	1	2	1	923641	10/5/11	Not going to lie, she is probably one of the worst teachers to take writing seminar with. She gives off a vibe of knowing everything, which is understandable since she probably sits around all day and reads anyways, and is pretty unyielding when it comes to grading. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature	123	3	1	2	1	923641	5/20/10	i got A- for all my assignment n she gave me a b because of D participation and she is so meant!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		5	5	5	1	923641	2/16/10	Didnt want to take this class at all before I actually took it. Ended up being one of my favorites. Started out expecting quizzes, we only had about 2. Class almost always was out early. Excellent feedback on work turned in on time. If you fix whats marked, you get an A. Participation is required, but just throw in a question/comment here or there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature	101	4	4	4	2	923641	6/21/09	I believe she is a fair grader, this is a college course. With that said, you need to write to her standard. While it is a little bit more strict, I believe that here criticism is constructive. Little homework, but make sure you attend the class. She will warn you if your in trouble. She wants students to learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature		5	5	5	2	923641	1/22/09	Julie is an excellent professor when it comes to writing. She is very helpful and grades your rough drafts with comments so that you can fix your mistakes and get an A on every paper. No exams and little HW, only 3 easy essays
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature		1	1	2	1	923641	5/6/08	Terrible teacher. Do not take this class with her. She is under the impression people want to be there and grades accordingly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature	319	2	5	5	5	923641	3/16/07	Julie is an excellent teacher who inspires her students to learn. She knows what she is teaching and how to teach is, so don't be afraid to ask for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	2	Literature	227	2	4	4	1	923641	1/29/07	She sometimes is very cocky, and hard at grading. (She'll give you a 0 if you don't meet essay length requirements by a half page) She's very nice about helping you though, and I learned a lot in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Julie Johannes	3.5	0	Literature		1	2	2	3	923641	11/22/06	This professor has unreasonable deadlines for papers. Also very strict about how to write papers. Very nitpicky and lets her pms get in the way of teaching the class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		4	5	5	3	234340	9/14/11	Dr. Ishman is a fantastic instructor. She challenges students in order to bring out the best writing possible from them. She is willing to help students whenever they need it. It's sad that no one will be lucky enough to have her class anymore since she is now retired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		2	5	4	3	234340	1/28/11	Ishman was tough and scary at first, but once you got settled in, you can tell she cares about your writing. She pushes us hard because she wants us to do well. Take her if you want to learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	234340	3/5/10	don't oversleep and do your work and you'll be okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	3/2/10	Wow, she's leaving. I became a better writer thanks to her. Love her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		5	5	5	5	234340	2/10/10	Ishman is awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		1	5	5	5	234340	2/3/10	Had her twice, very fair and tough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		1	5	5	5	234340	1/21/10	The best teacher I ever had. Her lectures are interesting, do not listen to the bad reviews and you should take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		2	5	5	5	234340	12/4/09	Very helpful, take her if you have the guts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		2	2	1	1	234340	10/20/09	Ishman is a tough teacher to please and tends to hold grudges against you for the rest of the term if you mess up at the beginning. I wouldn't recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing	202	5	3	5	2	234340	6/9/08	Regardless of the negative comments we usually hear from her, I think she is a good teacher. She is real stickler about grammar. It is to be expected. It is an English class; we all need to improve our grammar skills in order to meet the standard. If you do all of your work on the time, and pay attention to your grammar. You will do just fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	1	Writing		2	3	2	5	234340	2/1/11	ugh
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		1	5	5	5	234340	10/14/10	Brilliant teacher! She would do anything to help you to get a good grade. It's not too hard to get a B unless you work for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	3/4/10	There won't be a teacher like Ishman. She signs so well and she makes everything understandable. She's the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	3/1/10	I love her, she's such a sweet woman. If you do the work she tells you to do, she will like you, period. If you don't, she'll fail you, period. She's sure the best professor! I'll miss her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	2/9/10	Dr. Ishman equals the greatest teacher ever. Take her and you'll know why.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	234340	1/26/10	Take her before she retires..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	12/8/09	Why are people are judging her so harshly? She's fantastic. The harsh reviewers are the ones who doesn't like the challenge she gives.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	234340	12/3/09	The best writing seminar Teacher at RIT! She's tough, but very helpful!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	2	Writing		2	4	4	1	234340	2/24/09	Dr. Ishman is tough, but you got to do the work she asked for. If you didn't do the work, she will fail you, period. I did the work and I managed to get a B. She's quite helpful outside the classroom. Take her if you have the chance!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		1	1	1	1	234340	3/15/06	Horrible professor, doesnt know what she wants. Loves to see students stay in NTID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		2	2	2	1	234340	11/2/05	Not a great teahcer
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		3	2	2	5	234340	5/7/05	Difficult to believe this professor has a doctorate's in English. I spent my classes correcting her or helping other students do things the right way. After admonishing me for stating the way I had I learned it in the past- she would then come back and say that I was correct in what I had said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		2	1	3	NULL	234340	4/6/04	Dr. Ishman never understand what I'm trying to say to her until I had to repeat what I just told her many times. What I have noticed is that she have four or five agendas that she wants to talk about it but she only discuss about half of them in the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	1	Writing		2	2	3	NULL	234340	7/29/03	Dr. Ishman loves to see that students are staying in NTID, not bachelor-level programs or other advanced degree programs by giving these students bad grades. She is the most misunderstood person ever I have. A ridiculous task that Dr. Ishman has given m
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		1	2	2	1	234340	11/16/05	She have a difficult grading system which she rates and scores the paper's structure and grammer (that it!). She often ignore the EFFORTS of time working on paper, length of paper, the style of writing, use of vocabs. She didn't care if you wrote a very good paper! All she care is the grammer ****! Do not take her class if you hate challenges!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sybil Ishman	3.5	0	Writing		1	1	1	1	234340	10/2/05	Ishman has got to be the worst professor I have ever had! I'm an RIT student, through NTID, which means exactly what the other person said in another comment. She gave me bad grades, no matter how hard I did. I even had another English professor help me on the work she assigned and I still got bad marks. Her teaching is very unclear too, and she has different standards for everyone, which is unfair, especially the way she does it. Do NOT take her class, unless you're looking to bring your GPA down.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	1	Mathematics		3	1	5	4	1695046	3/6/13	Be careful with this teacher. Quizzes are 1-2 questions and he never scales even when the class needs one. Prepare yourself for redundant work and if you want an A, that's tough to get with this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	0	Mathematics	282	2	1	1	3	1695046	1/25/13	Difficult to understand accent, ridiculously long homework, absurd attendance requirement, not very useful when asked questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	2	Mathematics	467	4	5	5	5	1695046	5/9/12	Had him for discrete 1 & 2 and graph theory. Usually very clear in class if you pay attention, but if you have trouble he is very good at explaining things one on one in office hours. He is very likely to bump you up a letter grade if you are on the border (eg 89.0 -> A), as long as you came to class and showed that you worked hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1695046	2/21/12	He is a good teacher. He really explain everything well and super organize his materiel. love him....take your class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	1695046	2/13/13	This professor is horrible. His grading on homework is VERY harsh. The problems on the homework are even, so there is no possible way to check your answers unless you come in and see him. His quizzes are also very difficult. They contain 3 problems and they are extreme hard compared to what is given on the final. His tests are equally hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	1	Mathematics	366	1	3	3	1	1695046	11/17/12	Difficult class, difficult professor. Lots (*lots*) of busywork for homework. Quiz every week, homework actually graded. Three exams. Does easy examples in class then gives the hardest ones of quizzes/exams. Good instructor but a little too much in the difficulty department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jobby Jacob	3.3	2	Mathematics		3	3	5	2	1695046	3/4/12	I thought that while he explained the subject well, his tests and grading were too harsh for the class. Most material was copied straight from the text.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Jacobs	2.5	0	Hospitality		1	2	2	5	759747	4/1/13	i admit that he is one of the toughest teacher but i learned a lot from him professionally and personally. he is language is hard to understand but he likes to push his students to learn more out of the class. he LOEVS dialogue and examples of existing company and he is obsessed of Tech
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Jacobs	2.5	2	Hospitality		2	5	4	3	759747	11/17/05	Great Professor. You will learn so much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Jacobs	2.5	0	Hospitality		2	1	1	2	759747	11/13/08	This man is useless and needs to throw in the towel, he does not explain any assignments and refuses to help you when you ask. He takes forever to give your grades if he gets you them at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication		5	5	4	3	1480857	11/8/12	Sebby is laid-back, fun, & personal. Everyone gets chance to talk. All about right brain, savoring physical reality. Portfolio reviews. Light HW & enough time given for research project. She makes it our duty to rediscover the awesome joy of "real life," something those of the Internet Age are starving for, yet sadly don't know it. Enjoy the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication		3	4	4	4	1480857	11/20/11	Great professor. She gives assignments every class, but they take 2 hours tops. Always helpful. Makes the class laugh. Usually pretty reasonable and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication		3	5	5	4	1480857	10/31/11	Sebby is my favorite professor at RIT. She has a lot of real-world experience to help make her points and her sense of humor makes class fun. She is always willing to help if you ask questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication		2	5	5	4	1480857	1/27/11	Sebby is amazing! She is so passionate about Journalism and is extremely willing to help you if you need help. Sends out e-mails after every class recapping what happened/what is due next class which is very helpful. It's her first year teaching here but she's honestly one of the best teachers I've ever had. Assigns readings, but there are no tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication	201	4	4	4	2	1480857	11/29/11	Took Introduction to Journalism class under Sebby in Fall 2011. It's an easy-peasy class and she's really nice. Rule of thumb to A: Always come to class even if you're gonna be late, read NY Times & Elements of Journalism - the required textbook ... and do your homework journals. The workload is not that demanding and she doesn't give exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	0	Communication		3	1	2	3	1480857	11/9/11	Rarely "taught". Gave writing assignments then had each student give progress report. Subsequent advice was usually outside the realm of reason. Gave gargantuan assignments, then when faced with no one able to finish on time, repeatedly pushed back due date to make up for her mistake. Proof that "real life experience" does not = teaching ability.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selma Jacobson	4.0	2	Communication	101	3	4	4	3	1480857	2/15/11	Sebby is one of the best professors I've had. She's really cool, really nice, and she knows her stuff. She's flexible on due dates and is an easy grader. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Archana  Jain	2.0	0	Accounting		4	3	1	2	1794608	1/30/13	If you are fortunate enough to understand her, then you'll most likely have trouble keeping up with her lessons. She teaches quickly, and doesn't really stop to see if anyone needs assistance. She told the class we did not need a financial calculator, and then proceeded to tell the class it was required halfway through the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	2	Philosophy	201	3	5	4	4	150551	2/24/08	great professor. I had him for Philosophy of Language. really understand what he's talking about and can clear things up pretty easily. Tests are very thorough and missing one class can completely lose you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	2	Philosophy		2	5	3	2	150551	2/8/06	His tests you have to know everything word for word but he curves like no other so dont worry too much. I dont recomend him but he does make every attempth that he can to help you if you want it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	2	Philosophy	210	2	3	4	4	150551	3/1/05	Reading the books is usually unnecessary, but study the notes and arguments over and over again. The stuff on the tests is useless to Philosophy. He doesn't test you on your knowledge of Philosophy or how to apply your skills, he tests you more or less on how well you study.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	NULL	150551	2/26/03	Tends to let the class go off on tangents a little too long. Provides notes which summarize the readings- so you can often get by without doing the full readings. Recommend you are familiar with formal logic, but it's not a prerequisite.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	1	Philosophy		3	3	3	1	150551	10/23/07	lectures can get very boring if your not into this subject and taking it because its required. you have to know the material well to get good test scores. very mellow guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	1	Philosophy		3	3	2	2	150551	1/27/06	very hard to stay focused in class b/c he generally goes off on tangents that make no sense, but if you copy notes word for word that he writes down and you study its an easy class and he gives you study guides that tell you EXACTLY what will be on the test so its your own fault if you do poorly...oh and he grades on a curve.. which is VERY helpful

Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Janssen	3.7	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	NULL	150551	10/14/03	cool teacher, fun class, even at 8am:-)...thanks mr. janssen
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	330	4	5	5	3	693944	2/17/12	Had him for IDM. He makes everything clear of what he wants you to do for each assignment. He is clear with instructions and he takes the time to explain things. Just make sure you show up to class and pay attention; he hates it when people don't. Otherwise, great guy, lots of fun in his class and I learned a lot from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		4	3	5	4	693944	11/10/11	Nice guy, easy class. Moves a little slow at times, but all of the presentations and assignments are posted online for easy reference later. Homework is taken seriously, but is usually a reasonable portion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	320	4	5	5	4	693944	11/17/10	Fantastic teacher. Takes time to make sure you understand the material. Projects are graded fairly. All grading criteria is given out with the assignment, so there's no reason to not get an A, unless you can't follow directions. Tests are fair, no surprises. I'd have no problem taking another class from prof. Jefferson.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	601	5	5	5	3	693944	11/18/09	Very helpful prof, and appreciate that he has a sense of humor. Useful in class assignments, completed them all in class, good lectures and lots of time to do the 2 big projects. Had to write a paper...but it was only 500 words. WOuld take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	1	Information Science		2	3	2	3	693944	2/8/09	I don't know how students can rate him as GOOD...this professor does absolutely nothing but collect a paycheck. You have to rely on reading the books to learn anything. He talks really fast and expect students to get what he is saying right away. He lectures for 10 minutes. It really suck for students that are paying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	320	4	4	5	4	693944	11/12/07	Great teacher. got off to a rough start in the class but after a while started to like the material a lot as well as the way prof. Jefferson presented the material. Now I love making web pages, just because of this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		3	5	5	4	693944	4/1/07	He's an awesome professor. Basically what you do in class is sit, wait for him to tell you to try to figure something out, try it, and when you don't get it, have him explain it. When he explains the process, you'll get it right away. He tells you exactly what he wants in your projects and if you get bogged down, he has a tendency to move dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	230	4	5	5	4	693944	1/29/07	Jefferson is a great teacher. He makes the class fun and always adds humor to programming. He's a fun guy, and he'll teach you a lot, being very helpful when you're confused.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		3	5	5	4	693944	11/13/11	Tony Jefferson is a great professor. One of my favorite so far in my college career and I have now been here for 3 years. He knows his stuff and can explain it very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		5	5	5	2	693944	11/9/11	Really nice guy, fairly easy professor. Seems strict at first but pretty laid back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		4	2	5	5	693944	11/24/09	He took an extremely easy class but graded all projects very strictly. Points off for missing class. Follow his directions to the point or you will pay for it. He keeps class fun, but is unwilling to go out of his way to help. Overall cool guy, but disappointing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		3	5	5	5	693944	9/16/09	Took him for the PHP class. A generally good teacher. Exams are fair. As long as you can do the weekly assignments well you will do fine on the written midterm and final practical. Would take classes with him again. Workload not outrageous, but this class is generally not easy for most people.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science		5	4	5	4	693944	11/13/07	One might expect a professor to be really knowledgeable in their field, and yes, Jefferson knows a lot of what he is talking about, but is definitely able to admit that he has to look something up. His classes are easy to follow, and the class exercises are easy. Pretty much an easy class if you just do the work. He's a pretty good guy, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	320	4	5	5	2	693944	10/9/07	Professor Jefferson ROCKS. One of the funniest and most helpful professors you can get, and he makes everything simple, yet informative. If you can, take his class. It's the only one where you're in danger of getting hit by a flying rubber chicken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Jefferson	4.6	2	Information Science	320	5	4	5	4	693944	3/11/07	Very funny guy, and definitely on a college student's level when it comes to communication and teaching. He's an easy grader and assigns pretty easy assignments and projects to help your grade. I would certainly take one of his classes again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	0	Communication	501	1	1	2	2	690438	6/17/12	Professor obviously cares very deeply about the subject matter, but assigns far too much work for a class of this nature at this institution. This class alone takes me approximately 3 times as much time as my other 3 classes combined. On a more personal level, I found prof. Jenkins to be deeply condescending and downright rude to students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	0	Communication	101	2	1	3	1	690438	4/5/11	This guy is one of the most conceded professors I've ever had. I'd drop the class but that would put me behind on graduation. Very hypocritical and will grade you poorly over systematical differences, like the indentation on a speaking outline.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	1	Communication	101	3	2	3	3	690438	2/17/10	I personally hated Jenkins. He is full of himself and full of his area of study (intercultural communication, of course) I am a straight A honors student at RIT and did not get an A in his class. And I found it really boring. Don't take it if you can manage...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication	520	3	3	4	3	690438	3/5/09	A lot of busy work.. You have to do five interviews with people of different cultures and have to read and respond to each and every persons journals (about ten in your group). Gets old after a while. Class is mandatory! If you don't go to class you will most likely get a lower letter grade. Taking notes is a MUST.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication	535	2	5	3	3	690438	7/25/07	Jenkins draws for attention. He is awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication	200	3	5	5	3	690438	11/8/06	Very straight-forward with assignments and expectations. Stuck to the syllabus. Not difficult, but not easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	690438	8/17/06	The greatest professor ever. So interesting... You have to do the work but if you have at least some interest in the class, you'll do just fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		3	5	3	5	690438	10/12/05	Great professor overall, goes out of his way to get to know you. his tests are not easy, but you will learn alot. his grading methods are consistent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication	501	3	5	5	3	690438	6/28/11	Dr. Jenkins is a great teacher who wants to see you learn. I took Public Speaking with him and it was a fun class. He is good about giving constructive feedback, and doesn't grade too hard. Take notes, read the relevant sections, and come to class and you're good. Got a C because I missed two assignments, but otherwise would've had an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		3	4	4	2	690438	1/25/11	Nice guy, but have ridiculously high expectations of his students. A harsh grader. A huge advocate for blended learning (in classroom and online)...if you don't like online classes, don't take this one. A good portion of your grade depends on the online aspect! Very understanding of people with disabilities
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	0	Communication	102	1	1	1	2	690438	11/17/09	Extremely hard teacher! WAAAAYYY too much work for the unimportant classes he teaches! Expect lots of busy work and hardly any actual teaching or lecturing! Poor teacher and way to strict on grades!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		2	4	4	3	690438	2/22/08	Jenkins is a good professor. He knows a lot and is willing to help students. I just felt like his tests were impossible to pass. The class is a lot of work but if you're willing to do it, then do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		2	5	5	5	690438	12/26/06	Well spoken & entertaining...never boring. Lots of work but if you do it, you will do well. Fair grading, # of assignments/test. Tests do have book reading info so read book. Focus on PPs though & attend class bc it is on test too. Test are tough but he prepares you well if you pay attention in class & study 1 hr a day starting a week b4 test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	690438	10/20/06	Best guy ever!!!! Interesting, understanding, funny...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Jenkins	3.7	2	Communication		2	3	4	3	690438	2/20/06	tests are quite hard but lectures are interesting. If you're looking for an easy A, look elsewhere
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics		5	5	5	4	961641	7/4/11	Professor Jodoin was the best physics teacher I had at RIT. He was very clear and friendly, and always explained a bit further than the other teachers. His grading was also the fairest (not easy, fair). RIT really is in desperate need of teachers as keen as him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics	311	4	5	4	5	961641	2/2/10	Very good professor, always willing to help if students are lost, very good at explaining labs and always willing to help with labs and class work if needed, tests are fair. Homework is long but if you don't wait until the last minute its usually not too bad. Overall, best physics professor in the department, definitely take his class if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics	301	3	5	5	5	961641	9/17/07	absolutely the best physics professor in the whole department. physics by itself isnt easy, and in particular univ. 3. If you are taking it I strongly recommend you take this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	1	Physics	311	4	3	2	5	961641	2/27/07	Nice guy, doesnt take enough time to teach core concepts. Just kind of assumes you know what he did in the one example he shows and then moves on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	961641	4/19/10	great professor. He explained anything i needed help on and a fair guy. He let me do an extra credit project that i was passionate about and it may lead to me doing research at rit. Very helpful. A great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics	313	3	5	4	4	961641	2/7/08	An easy going guy that knows his stuff. Class is interesting. Willing to help during office hours. In short, take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics	311	2	4	4	4	961641	5/2/07	Nice guy...easy grader....teaches you what you need to know. His tests are very fair, and test you on the concepts of the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Jodoin	4.4	2	Physics		3	4	5	2	961641	5/11/06	Very nice guy, always clear on his explinations, and was available for help when i needed it. Not a lot of web-assign compared to other professors i've had for physics. A must take professor if available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology	210	5	5	5	3	1335909	10/27/12	He is the best. Easy tests, understandable slides and overall you learn a lot. He is a real nice guy, though the class may be boring once in a while. Attendance is graded so I'd say go for every class. Overall, I'd say go for him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology		4	3	4	3	1335909	5/4/12	He's really nice and all of his tests and homeworks are really straightforward, not too hard at all. The class isn't super interesting but I don't imagine any cultural class is. Not bad- I'd suggest him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	1	Sociology	101	5	3	3	1	1335909	11/14/11	He's not a bad guy, but his voice is monotonous and the class is rather boring. The homeworks and papers are easy and there shouldn't be a problem with them. To ace the tests just review the chapters in the book before class, or his powerpoints. Don't expect him to be very reliable, but he knows the class isn't that exciting and tries to compensate
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology	101	5	4	4	3	1335909	1/27/11	He has a very monotonous voice, but if you skim/read through the textbook a day or so before the tests you'll do fine. I fell asleep in his class multiple times and had no problem getting high A's on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology		5	5	5	4	1335909	8/6/12	I had him for Cultural Anthropology. he is really a NICE and HELPFUL guy. his voice is monotonous. but he is funny. He tells stories related to what in the lecture which make it easy to remember in the tests. Tests are the easiest (straightforward from the slides) 40 multi-choices and 60 short answers. EASY A. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology		4	4	4	4	1335909	5/2/12	He's such nice guy! Very easygoing and approachable. The class is easy and a good liberal arts choice. There are 3 tests and 1 presentation/paper but if you review the powerpoints beforehand you're set. I'd definitely recommend taking it with him, everyone's mean comments on here aren't accurate
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	2	Sociology	101	5	5	4	2	1335909	10/13/11	such an easy A! the tests were easy if you reviewed the notes a bit and the papers you had to write were also easy. although class was kinda boring, he's a really nice guy. just take the notes and you'll be fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abe Johnson	3.8	0	Sociology		5	1	2	1	1335909	11/28/09	He makes class awfully boring and teaches us what seems like useless information. He never graded papers on time, I never got a single one of my papers back. Never responded to my emails, and doesn't post the powerpoint sometimes an hour before a test. Don't bother buying the book, he never uses it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Johnson	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	491	5	5	5	4	1207179	10/29/12	Great Professor. Very interesting and has a interesting sense of humor. Took two classes with him. Wish he taught more at Brockport. Take home tests. Pay attention in class to do well on them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Johnson	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	3	5	3	1207179	11/15/08	This teacher is very friendly and understanding of any issues that arise. The class consists of 2 papers and 2 take home tests which are all easy. The class is broken into discussions and actually interviewing students. The interviews are awkward and forced, but you learn through practice. Good teacher, odd class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Johnson	1.5	0	Criminal Justice	440	4	1	2	1	1449381	6/18/10	If you have a valid excuse for missing 1 class or forgot to do a reading assignment, Good Luck for the rest of the quarter. Don't take.

Get B+ in class & A in lab & you'll get A. Bookreading is MUST Lots of personal initiative 2 learn material Class is presentation style-?s on reading no info lectur

Rochester Institute of Technology	Will Jonen	2.9	2	Science	302	2	5	5	4	918638	3/13/08	Dr. Jonen seemed a little nervous and inexperienced the first semester I had with him, which made him seem strict and somewhat egotistical. After that I think he learned what teaching is all about and he has definitely matured as a professor and one of the best out there. To be a good professor it is important to be able to relate to the students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Will Jonen	2.9	0	Science		1	1	1	5	918638	12/22/06	This professor is so full of himself and that gets in the way of his teaching. his tests are gernerally unfair and he never curves. if you ever have a problem, dont waste your time talking to him about it. AVOID HIM
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology	202	1	1	1	1	480311	10/7/09	awful. simply awful. that's all i can say.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	2	4	480311	12/26/06	Only B I had all 1st year. Her teaching style is lecture oriented(book regurgitation of information). The PP quizzes helped your grade & remembering material but exams were very hard. The tricky conceptual ?'s tested more about understanding the question rather than the material. Student needs to seek her help out of class which is then helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology	123	1	2	2	4	480311	7/20/06	Awful professor, Talks to you like you're a child, Pulls all material out of the book, Speeds through material like it's her job, Laughs at you if you ask her questions, Difficult Test Questions, Good Luck Freshman -- Ended up getting Consistant C's which ruined my GPA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	2	4	480311	10/17/05	Somebody tell her that we're not in middle school anymore. She talks to you in class like youre 10 and goes through slides the book probably provided.....and then the tests are worded horribly with answers that all look the same...totally uncool
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	2	Biology		3	4	3	3	480311	5/1/05	She isn't bad... goes pretty quick but she will help you. Great lab teacher. Tests aren't that bad... I don't go to class all the time or study and still get B's. Down to Earth lady.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	2	Biology	205	3	3	4	4	480311	11/6/07	I only had her for lab, and she did a good job of instructing that. Helpful with answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	1	Biology		2	3	2	3	480311	11/17/06	Yeah, yeah, yeah...she can be a really nice woman, but the materials she teaches depend on the effort you put in. It does appear easy to understand the lecture materials as most of the information are derived from the book and PPs. However, the hardest task is the exams because the questions are detailed and somewhat over-analyzed. Good luck! =P
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	2	Biology		3	3	4	3	480311	1/26/06	The tests were hard and tricky, but if you read the chapter and outlined most of it you could pull a B. I wouldn't say i put a tremenous amount of effort into this class and i still did fairly well. She says randomly amusing things about the subject and is really down to earth. The lab practicals were kind of rough unless you take lab with greg m
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	1	3	480311	5/6/05	goes way too fast, focuses on details way too much. prolly the worst teacher ive had here at rit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	1	3	480311	1/30/05	Very Tricky tests, you must know ur stuff to the T. or the question will trick you. Large class, only looking at a powerpoint i don't even believe she makes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessa Jones	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	2	5	480311	10/27/04	if you don't read the book,you will fail. her questions are worded in a way that she tries to trick you even if you know your stuff. studying for 14 hours would not be enough for her class. dont ask her questions because she will be snippy and not answer them because you waste her time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing	227	5	5	4	1	1042088	11/12/12	Mr Jones is a very nice man. His class is a little dull but you can expect to receive a good grade if you just show up to class and do the assigned papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	0	Writing	227	2	2	2	5	1042088	10/26/11	Class was difficult compared to other Writing Sem professors. Attendance is mandatory. Expect your essays to be graded harshly. Never explains things clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	5	5	1	1042088	3/1/10	Absolutely the best writing prof. a little boring but attendance isnt mandatory. longest paper was two pages double spaced. very easy A. i highly recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	0	Writing	101	5	1	1	2	1042088	11/5/07	The reviews below must have been written by a relative of Mr. Jones. He is a very lazy professor. He's just there to get paid. You won't learn anything but you'll get an A. Yeah, he's an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	3	4	2	1042088	10/8/07	Pretty easy professor. Tends to get distracted very easily which is amusing at first but tends to get annoying after a while. Very flexible with assignments. Looks for creativity and will accept a variety of writing styles. Overall, the class is good for mandatory liberal arts credits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	4	5	4	1042088	12/4/06	Great teacher, very easy-going, take him if u get the chance :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	4	4	2	1042088	10/26/05	He is the man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	4	4	4	1042088	2/28/05	He is very easy-going and understanding. It is easy to get good grades from him, but he does not hold attention well at all and horribly schedules the assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	4	4	5	1042088	11/18/11	I had Jones for Arts of Expression: Writing the Discipline - Medicine; First, Do no Harm. The class was extremely easy, though useful if you actually pay attention. He doesn't have any exams, and the essays are simple. Overall, I enjoyed the class. Professor Jones is an awesome guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing	319	5	3	5	2	1042088	5/13/11	Very easy class. He doesn't mind if you miss a few classes, and you can rewrite all your papers for a higher grade. Papers aren't longer than a couple of pages double spaced. Lectures are pretty boring though, but he is a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	1	Writing	101	4	2	3	3	1042088	1/21/10	He puts me to sleep every Tuesday and Thursday that I have his class for 2 hours. He gets off topic a lot, and it's really boring. Personally, just the way he talks is so boring. Every class feels like it'll never end. Seems like an easy A, but not worth the pain of boredom imo.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing	227	5	5	5	3	1042088	10/23/07	Jonesie is awesome. Highly recommended. Even though the class is 8 in the morning its def worth it. He doesnt always keep you awake but he occasionally whips out some 'yo momma' jokes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		5	5	5	5	1042088	2/7/07	Great guy first off and he is very knowledgeable. The class is a bit boring, but the assignments are very easy and he's always looking for creativity in writing so he's flexible on most any writing you do. Good teacher, definately take him if you get a chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		4	4	3	2	1042088	11/14/05	Good teacher, assignments are easy but fair.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Nick Jones	3.8	2	Writing		4	4	4	2	1042088	2/21/05	Awsome guy, real easy grader, just hand in ur essays, but will almost always give an extension... if ur an engineer like me and don't really do well in normal english, take him... if u want to really get into english and learn about all that crap... suggestion is not... but still a great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayad Kadhim Follow jaafar00365	4.5	2	Languages		4	5	4	4	1500751	10/22/12	Fantastic teacher, really cares how his students do. Scales the material for each student. Gives you the test ahead of time to study. Essay every week but only five sentences. Would love to take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ayad Kadhim Follow jaafar00365	4.5	2	Languages		2	5	4	5	1500751	11/24/10	Arabic is a hard class and moves quickly, but he was very helpful. After taking his class you are ahead if you take the next with a different professor.-- Do ALL of the homework and it really dos help to use the DVD. KNOW YOUR VOCAB!! and speak out in class even if you sound like an idiot, he gives alot of extra credit. ALSO!NEVER CHECKS HIS EMAIL!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	1	Business		2	3	3	3	956373	2/27/13	Very tough grader but she makes you reflect on class materials with the dynamics of her lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	1	Business	740	2	1	4	4	956373	1/27/12	Worst possible instructor for deaf students. Fall and Winter QTR, I've met up with other deaf taking her class, just terrible. Not sure if this is a cultural thing (shes from India) but have absolutely no sense of respect or empathy for deaf students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	1	Business		4	2	3	5	956373	1/14/11	See, I got warned about her class. I didn't listen. It ended being a very stressful class. Very case-study oriented class and the deal is to only give her what she wants to hear. I spent a quarter trying to figure out what she wanted and didn't learn anything concrete.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	0	Business	455	1	1	1	4	956373	2/19/10	She needs help!! The worst professor I have had since starting at RIT. Her exams are unfair - combination of badly designed exam + harsh grading. She is not open to feedback, and seems like she doesn't care. I wish someone had warned me about her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	0	Business		1	1	1	4	956373	7/6/09	curious if she really knows what she teaches, pointless class, shouting all the time, torturous to sit in. leanred nothing, got A, waste of money and time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	0	Business	455	1	1	1	4	956373	11/23/08	class: not organized, grading: highly subjective, personality: impossible to approach
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	0	Business	112	1	1	3	1	956373	3/24/08	She speaks all the time, pretending that she is involving all the audience into discussion. Even if she asks questions regarding specific topics, her questions are vague and more rhetorical. During all the class time major of audience have to see and stare at her or other chosens to answer, who can be criticized in a strong and impolite manner.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	2	Business		1	5	4	4	956373	3/6/12	Very tough grader, Shal knows what she wants and will not give out A's unless you understand this. Shal is very enthusiastic, it is quite evident that she possesses a tremendous amount of knowledge on the subject, and better yet, she is passionate about it! Highly recommended for those willing to work hard for their A's.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	2	Business		2	3	5	4	956373	10/11/11	Professor is always very well prepared for class. Rigorous class, but well worth the time and effort. Learned more in her class than any other class I'va taken at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	2	Business		2	4	4	3	956373	4/12/10	I found this professor to be very well prepared for class. Taught mostly from case studies, seldom used text. Class discussions were lively, but on topic. Not sure why my experience seems to be the exception based on comments here. Would definitely take another class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	0	Business		2	2	1	2	956373	2/1/10	Quizzes on chapters at beginning of class so its required to read the chapter beforehand (which is fine) but then she TEACHES THE SAME CHAPTER after the quiz. How does that make sense? She grades terribly, & if you dont have the exact wording shes looking for, even though you get the point across, she marks you off. Never again. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	1	Business		2	4	2	2	956373	6/2/09	She doesn't help you in the end with final grade. Very subjective in grading, not too fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Kahzanchi	2.7	2	Business	885	2	5	5	4	956373	4/6/08	Awesome professor! very well organised course. extremely helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science	735	2	5	5	4	251450	1/31/12	Took him for grad level Parallel Computing. Wonderful professor however he is a little monotone and stoic. He's very approachable if his stoicism doesn't scare you off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	3	5	5	251450	5/4/10	Good professor only if there are no grades involved in the matter. Projects grading is unfair to a point you lose 5% of your whole course marks because of an extra comma in your output. Not reasonable at all. Not recommended if you are looking for A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		1	4	5	4	251450	3/10/09	He is good at teaching, but grades harshly. You get either 100% or 50%. You will lose lots of points on project if there is a minor error. Not an easy class at all! If you don't have to take from him, then don't! Unfair at grading, but excellent at teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	4	251450	3/12/07	His projects are graded unfairly. He grades harsh and wants everything his way so be careful. His tests aren't too bad and he is a smart man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	5	251450	10/9/05	Good guy. Easy to follow in class, tests can be a little tricky but not too horrible if you study. Very easy to take notes off him. Projects can be a little tough, but they're interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	NULL	251450	9/19/03	Excellent professor. If you'd like to learn, take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	4	251450	10/18/11	Good professor. Grading too strict. If you miss one small comma or add an extra one which doesn't match with his requirements you can lose 5 % of your whole course grade. Very unfair in that manner. Otherwise I would love to take another course under him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	1	Computer Science		4	2	3	4	251450	4/9/10	This guy lives in a box: All is simple but must be done to perfection. All material and assignments are easy and clear, but grading is ruthless. He'll give you a zero for all sorts of mistakes, and NEVER makes exceptions. Tests are easy but must be done quickly and accurately. This is the most stressful class I've taken, but I learned little.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	2	251450	5/18/07	This professor knows a lot, but sucks at teaching, (old fifties style). Grade projects harshly. very slow, have no clue how to make topic intersting. He is PHD, but has no teaching skill at all! No flexibility at all! If you are super brilliant and can learn on your own, take him. if you come to rit to learn, take the class with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	5	251450	11/14/05	Worst professor I've had in the CS department. His project grading is unreasonably strict and unfair. Tests are not too hard, and are graded fairly. Knows a lot, but can't teach well, and project grading is horrible. Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Kaminsky	3.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	3	4	251450	3/6/05	Seems to be very smart and prepares well for class. BUT, even though this is a graduate class, he grades as if it is a CS 1 class. VERY picky when it comes to projects, to the point where you'll get 10 pts marked off by having an extra period in your output.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Satish Kandlikar	4.5	2	Engineering	514	4	5	4	4	983967	4/28/07	This guy is awesome. He is very smart and excited about teaching. The class is very interesting and he did an awesome job of making sure everyone knew what was going on. The TA was awesome too so that helped. I would recommend him for any class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	2	Communication		2	5	4	4	1407438	9/24/12	Very good in getting the content across. Helpful, encourages you to rework material handed in. Overall an excellent professor, with real world knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	0	Communication		1	1	2	4	1407438	2/28/12	What sticks with me most is h9ow married to his own subjective opinion he is. In copywriting it was his personal opinion that determined the grade we got. In other classes I was told that I "had a hammer and everything looked like a nail," but no specific advice to work to improve. Half of my Cs are in his classes for these two reasons alone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	1	Communication		2	2	4	2	1407438	4/21/11	Horrible teacher. Takes points off for something he never informed you of. Ridiculous grader on papers and projects. Expects your work to be at a professional level when this is most likely your first class in apr.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	1	Communication		3	2	3	3	1407438	2/17/10	It was his first time teaching at RIT... no, just no. He's nice kind of? But is a really harsh grader on papers he isn't even clear about. Obsessed with blogging and Twitter.. so just write about that...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	2	Communication		2	5	4	4	1407438	5/3/12	Helpful if you ask for it. Able to rework assignments for better grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	2	Communication		3	5	5	3	1407438	11/10/11	Not quite sure what the problem is /w some people. He lets you rework graded weekly assignments. The final paper is pretty intense but overall you learn a great deal in his class. Took him for PR Writing and Copywriting and Visualization.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Johansson	3.6	2	Communication		3	5	4	4	1407438	9/24/10	Not a bad guy and the way he plays devil's advocate is enough to make anyone question themselves about even the simplest of comments. Fun and interesting guy and he makes the study of Public Relations less boring than it is in reality.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bethany Johnson	5.0	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1139907	5/21/08	She is an excellent student advisor, as well as a great freshman seminar teacher. She is great at answering any questions and responds to email very quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darryl Johnson	4.8	2	Networking Security & Systems	590	3	5	5	5	1535988	11/16/11	Excellent professor, very knowledgeable in network security and other subject matter. Very easy going and clear. Highly recommend any classes with Professor Johnson.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darryl Johnson	4.8	2	Networking Security & Systems	780	4	5	4	4	1535988	1/28/11	Good teacher. No tests. Multiple Presentations. One paper. Loves his job. Awesome all around guy and his lectures are never boring. I would recommend to all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	214052	3/4/12	AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	2	Engineering	363	1	5	4	3	214052	3/2/12	Prof J knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		2	2	2	4	214052	10/29/11	Was really excited to take this course, class started out really easy, then towards last 3 weeks of class he will SLAM you with work I wrote 1 ten pg paper, i have another 12-15 pg paper, 3 stupid analysis, and he wants 2 presentations... mind you LAST 3 WEEKS OF CLASS.. This should be a grad Course, because I wouldn't be so Pissed, Avoid if Can
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering	361	2	2	2	2	214052	11/30/09	Bad teacher, spend 2 classes on 1 question, its worthless to ask him a question
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		2	1	2	1	214052	4/28/08	Not clear on what he wants for assignments. Often grades arbitrarily and without any clear guidline. Asks students to be actively engaged in class, but when hard questions are posed he switches topics or says the question is outside the scope of the discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	214052	2/4/08	Absolutely terrible. Assigns an excessive amount of work from the get-go in his syllabus, and then assigns more and more all quarter long. Lectures are incoherent and talk about everything except anything you will be tested on. Tests are ridiculous, include "trick questions" and such. Worst teacher I've had here so far. avoid if at all possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering	700	1	1	1	1	214052	12/1/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	2	Engineering		3	5	4	NULL	214052	5/20/03	Hard course, but if you pay attention and use the concepts he gives you, it is not that hard of a course (billed as one of the toughest at RIT). He really is a funny guy and a good friend once you are done with the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering	363	1	1	1	5	214052	3/4/12	We go to school with good intentions to learn. If you do wanna learn don't get near this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		2	2	2	4	214052	10/29/11	Adding to the comment above, it was Urban Planning & Policy, you don't have to use the book... waste of $60, but it was actually a good read. Ask him for clarification on something, and he told me "Your research will give you an answer" but if you turn it in wrong he'll say "you should have come talk to me" -_- .. worse class of fall 11
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	2	Engineering	534	2	5	5	3	214052	1/18/11	uses his experience to make the subjects clear, relevant. Has a sense of humor that comes out sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	2	Engineering	361	3	5	5	5	214052	6/13/08	He is one of the best professors at RIT, able to explain the basics in a way i could use it. Exams are not easy, but I did fine - I learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering	402	1	3	1	3	214052	2/27/08	I have never rated a professor. But the reason why I'm rating him is so that every1 is aware before taking him. His exams a really hard and the way he teaches is just bad. Please do not take him for any course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		2	1	2	3	214052	5/12/07	Rabling, often incoherent. Spends too much time on the civics we learned in high school... then tries to defend his record as Mayor. Grades arbitrarily, changes assignments the day before they're due. Total waste of time, avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Johnson	2.4	0	Engineering		1	1	3	NULL	214052	5/21/04	words cannot describe, if you like pain and suffering for 10 straight weeks, this is it. the subject isn't bad, but he is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Jones	2.5	1	Communication	403	2	2	3	1	1568185	4/25/11	Pretty bad teacher. Pretty lazy, grades all assignments out of 5 points and if you do the assignment correctly you get a 4. Not too hard to get a B, pretty hard to get an A. He tells you how to use the dropbox about 40 mins of each class. Weekly assignments are supposed to be 3-4 pages generally. He does let out class very early though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	2	1	1	1043518	11/14/12	Very bad professor, vague and contradicts herself on assignments. If you meet in person she will make it more clear what you did wrong and if you follow what she wants to the letter you can get a B or an A. Do not expect to get away with doing little work, you can get a good grade if you try in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	4	1043518	9/21/12	Awful. Awful. Awful. Cannot repeat this enough. Doesn't explain anything and is vague at best. Avoid her like the plague.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	2	Graphic Arts	323	2	5	4	2	1043518	7/17/12	Unlike past reviews, we were given options for: buying books (text books were reserved in library) redoing assigments, and extra credit. Detailed outline of when assignments were due. Help was always offered, it solely depended if the student wanted the assistance. I often ask for help when I did not understand the material MultiMedia Strategy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	4	1043518	10/18/11	Worst professor i have ever had in school. I dont understand how this woman ever got a job at an academic institute, let alone graduate from one. absolutely terrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	2	2	3	1043518	10/5/10	Absolutely abysmal professor. An overflow of busywork assignments, and both instructions and due dates are ambiguous. It's a shame Cost isn't teaching the class anymore; she took a subject I was interested in and killed it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts	101	1	1	1	1	1043518	2/7/08	Undoubtedly one of my least favorite professors in college. Very largely authoritarian attitude towards running a course. Would avoid this one like the plague were I you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	2	Graphic Arts	101	1	5	4	3	1043518	11/25/07	Difficult class but if you are willing to put in a lot of work you can do okay. Lots of assignments but she allows you to retake exams. She acts like this is the real world and not college which I guess is good since that is why we are in school. It takes you for a surprise but I learned a lot. She really cares and is passionate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	2	3	1043518	11/6/07	Good luck...you are going to need it. She makes it very difficult for all her students. She believes that failure is the best way to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	2	1043518	11/8/12	Unorganized, unclear about assignments, makes NO sense when she's talking, and expects everyone to know exactly what she's thinking. She's a nice person, but the worst professor I've ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	5	1043518	8/7/12	WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD!assignments are unclear, she is extremely pretentious when you do ask for help, i missed ONE class, because i was legitimately sick and she berated me, told me she "didn't think i could do it" and made it impossible to catch up, i dropped her class and proudly shook her hand before walking across the stage in may...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	1	1043518	10/28/11	We are now 4/5ths of the way through this quarter and I am still not sure what she is trying to teach. Every assignment is horribly vague and leaves everyone confused about what they are even supposed to be doing. Massive amounts of reading covering tons of information, yet the tests are only a few questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	1043518	3/23/11	She is the definitely the definition of ambiguous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts	101	1	1	1	1	1043518	5/26/09	Entirely too difficult for her own good. Her assignments are very unclear. When you ask her for clarification she gets lost in her own explanation. lol.It would be great if she spent more time preparing her lessons and less time picking at her hair. I watched this lady pull a ball of hair out her head and place it on the desk like it was nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		2	2	2	4	1043518	1/15/08	Very unclear about assignments, does not let you redo assignments that are worth 20% of your grade each, even the the majority of the class was unclear of what the assignment even entailed. Does not believe in extra credit (extra work for her). Worst professor I've ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts	101	1	2	1	1	1043518	11/10/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Myrtle Jones	1.7	0	Graphic Arts		4	2	2	1	1043518	10/25/07	Has a 24hours email respond time but doesnt really follow through. Always seems lost in class. Goes to fast through material, and has very vague discriptions for everything. Unfortunalty most people who are in the Print departement have to take this class, however its not to hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business	315	5	4	5	3	703173	2/5/08	Really is a BS class cuz I still don't know how to use SARP. A GPA booster, and the test and assignment is easy. It took me on average 40-120 min to study and 30 min to finish his test. Ya even the final and I still got A on all of it. Nice and helpful person and shouldn't be teaching this pointless class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	0	Business		3	1	1	1	703173	11/17/06	worst class & teacher EVER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		5	5	5	3	703173	2/18/06	He is very helpful and very caring. He understands things and he notices if something is wrong. Even though the class may be a little boring, he has great stories and can be quite funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		5	5	5	3	703173	2/9/06	I agree with the person below. He doesn't try to squeeze in material if we don't have time. Very clear and to the point.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	0	Business		3	1	1	1	703173	1/18/06	BORING!!!!!!! He is off topic alot and he is very very hard to listen to. In addition, he basically punched my computer during class because he thought I was doing something other than his class, which I wasn't. I had my notes on my computer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	0	Business		2	1	1	1	703173	12/12/05	Do not take this prof. Gives quizzes on material he has not covered in class, you have to teacher yourself everything. On top of that, he does not know his left from right, or vertical from horizontal. In my opinion, he is not qualified to teach anyone if he does not know right from left.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		4	5	4	4	703173	11/7/05	very helpful, for the most part easy if you do the hw
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	1	Business		5	2	3	2	703173	8/20/07	Just participate in the activities he sets up, they aren't hard just follow the directions and shut your mouth. This is one of those classes where you have to forget what you know and let him tell what to do. Test questions are all in the test bank and your a fool if you fail them. His final is all the test questions from all the chapters you read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	0	Business		3	1	1	1	703173	2/22/06	terrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		5	5	5	3	703173	2/12/06	awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		5	5	5	5	703173	2/4/06	Great professor, very easy. He understands we only have 10 weeks of school unlike other professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Joseph	3.3	2	Business		5	4	3	1	703173	1/10/06	Kinda different... stays OFF topic all the time. It's the 4th week and we're still starting to go over chapter 3 even though we were already quizzed and tested on it. He;s a very easy teacher, who only has like 3 hmwk assignments.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bob Kahute	1.0	0	Design		3	1	1	3	671567	9/6/05	Bob is a terrible teacher who relies on a bunch of pre-rehearsed sayings to attempt teaching (again, you know, i don't know... maybe... uhhh it goes on your finger, or in your navel). He plays favorites, and offers no guidance or worthwhile input whatsoever. STAY AWAY FROM KAHUTE and his archaic nonsense gibberish called teaching.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	2	Psychology		3	4	5	4	437214	2/1/06	great professor. gives you a breakdown of every test question before the test. very funny, uses his own life examples in lecture.ess
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	1	Psychology		4	2	3	3	437214	11/18/05	download the Powerpoints from his webpage, no point in goin to class, but if you do decide to go count how many times he says essentially
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	437214	9/7/05	loved kaisers classes, always very interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	2	Psychology		4	5	5	NULL	437214	4/23/04	He knows what he's talking about and has at least one video a class... curves all tests based on the class' average. Very fair, you should be able to pass with good grades as long as you just listen to the lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	1	Psychology	210	2	3	3	3	437214	11/30/05	ok class but the test are hard. To take this class you need time to read the book. Even thought the powerpoints are 80+ slides long they dont cover half the stuff on the test
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	437214	10/24/05	This is the second time I have had Dr. Kaiser as a prof and I can definitely say hes one of my favorites!! His lectures are interesting with engaging class discussions and he makes the material interesting and easy to follow. His exams are also very clear and follow the material nicely! Definitely recommend him to anyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kaiser	3.9	0	Psychology		3	2	2	NULL	437214	5/18/04	This class was a nightmare. Needs to get organized + figure out what he's doing. He never had papers ready to give back with feedback. Didn't meet with students enough, and then gives out all poor final grades. BAD Teacher. BAD.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Kampschmidt	3.8	1	Computer Science	432	4	3	3	2	1598636	5/20/12	Meh. Not super clear on what he was doing, but I had very little interest in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matthew Kampschmidt	3.8	2	Computer Science	330	4	5	4	5	1598636	7/13/11	Great at explaining concepts and answering questions. Very fun and encourages group input. Tests are on the simple side though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History		5	4	4	3	1020687	11/8/12	Worked for the UN! Has experience & knows lots about politics, history, & current events. Very interesting lecturer; doesnt need PowerPoint! Unbiased, presents both sides of issue. Likes to call on quiet ones. Few videos. Gets in-depth & runs out of time, seemingly absent-minded in things besides international relations. Read the whole textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History	214	4	5	4	4	1020687	6/3/12	Very knowledgeable and informed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History	214	5	5	5	3	1020687	8/30/11	He helped me learn the material if I didn't understand. Went out of his way to help me with this class. I did receive an A!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History	211	3	4	3	4	1020687	4/19/11	I have never recieved so many B's. My writing has always been told that it is excellent, but not in this class. No matter what I wrote or how much time I devoted to it, I never got an A. Tread carefully in choosing to take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	0	History	325	1	2	2	4	1020687	11/12/10	He was not very clear on what he was looking for and graded far to harshly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	1	History	101	3	3	2	3	1020687	11/17/09	I had him for Commparative Politics and Human Rights. Not really a bad teacher. Matieral was interesting if you read the book. Dont really have to pay attention in class. Other people here said he's a hard grader but I got high B's or A's on my papers and I didn't put that much work into them. Deffinatly a lecture class so bring coffee or dip.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	0	History		2	1	2	4	1020687	5/10/08	worst teacher i ever had, i worked really hard for the class and i got a b, what sucks is that the whole class got a b too, so if u want a b take him, if u want an a look for someone else
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History	496	2	4	4	3	1020687	8/22/07	Really need to pay attention and take notes or you'll be completely lost. Very interesting lectures, though he is a talker and classes last for the entire time. Sometimes he gets side tracked but only because he gets really excited about a certain topic. Good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	2	History	446	4	4	3	4	1020687	7/16/12	I took his class Politics of Developing countries. The class is very easy. All you have to do is show up and review notes. He always jumps on different topics and he is boring . He is really horrible grader!! He would always give me a B grade for paper. If you want an easy class take his class. But never expect an A. Just a B!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	1	History		3	1	4	5	1020687	10/14/11	I enjoyed the class and the topic itself but could not stand him or his grading. I asked him a question and told me to look at the syllabus. I explained to him that I wanted him to clarify what the syllabus stated and he never responded. The test was easy but he grades his essays too harsh. Expect a B and nothing else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	0	History	211	3	2	2	2	1020687	7/27/11	Very easy class but absolutely impossible to get an A. If you do all the work satisfactorily, you will get a pretty easy B. Dr. Kannyo is a nice man but he is very vague in what he expects for his assignments which leave the class guessing about what he truly expects. If you're looking for an easy class that requires minimal work, this is it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	1	History		3	4	1	2	1020687	11/24/10	Kannyo is a very wise man and very close minded. His major flaw is being a huge scatter brain. His notes are illegible and attending his class is often unneeded. Many times I slipped out at the break. Just read the book and do the reports and you'll get a B. IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AN "A" IN THIS COURSE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	1	History		3	3	2	3	1020687	11/18/09	sometimes can be difficult to understand. attendance not necessary. no need to pay attention because he just rambles on and on about random facts that he will not test you on. one in class test, take home mid-term, take home final. 2 papers to write during the quarter about countries you pick and present
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	0	History		3	2	2	2	1020687	6/9/09	Can be hard to understand... he has a really thick accent and completely illegible handwriting. He doesn't explain what he wants from assignments. He is a tough grader - the best grade I've seen him give is a 93 so there's not much room for error. He definitely knows what he is talking about, it just takes a while to get used to his teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Kannyo	2.9	0	History	101	4	1	1	3	1020687	3/12/08	I had international relations with him He hates giving out A's. It's not a hard class because it's not supposed to be one; it's a liberal arts class. He doesn't explain what he expects on his assignments. All we had to do was summaries based on the chapters in the book or class lecture but no matter how detailed you wrote, it was always "B" materia
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	101	4	5	4	3	955874	5/22/11	Prof. Karim is awesome! He sometimes can be confusing, but all he wants is for his students to learn. Dances in class, loves Lady GaGa, and refers to himself as a "cool daddy". Tests are easy if you prepare for them
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	703	5	5	5	4	955874	1/11/10	He is so funny and make everything simple. He is easy grader in assignments and final project just do what he asked for don't make difficult stuff follow the instructions and u will be fine. DON'T forget to bring calculator to the class. Most of my friends and I got A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	703	5	4	4	3	955874	2/20/09	He is a great professors. Easy to get a high grade. But few things I didn't like about his teaching. His sense of humor is horrible. He also talks about the "contract". You need the book and calculator at all times. If you don't have it, then face a tirade and a bad joke that follows to neutralize it. Otherwise he is a good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	706	4	5	5	4	955874	2/9/08	He's fantastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	701	4	5	5	5	955874	1/13/08	GREAT PROFESSOR, AND A NICE PERSON.. EXCELLENT TO WORK WITH, ALWAYS INTERESTED IN HELPING OUT STUDENTS. CAN GET A VERY HIGH GRADE VERY EASILY.. GO AHEAD AND TAKE HIS CLASS, ACCOUNTING KNOWLEDGE IS MIND-BLOWING..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	335	2	5	3	5	955874	6/26/07	Great person and great professor. Kind of like a drill sargeant in class, but you will learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	0	Business	302	2	1	1	4	955874	9/9/10	Absolutely terrible. Attempts to teach "his own" version of the book, using useless diagrams and going off on rants about the local school system mid-class. If you aren't a select favorite, he will ignore you. Brings his 7-year-old to class when he has to babysit. A kid's Nintendo DS is extremely distracting when the professor is this bad. Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	0	Business	302	1	1	1	2	955874	8/20/09	terrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	101	3	5	4	5	955874	11/17/08	Great professor. MoveOnDotCom, Hard Cookie, and Piece of Cake. Has a great sense of humor. Do the homeworks and study the slides, and exam is gonna be piece of cake. Overall, the class is fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	704	2	4	5	4	955874	2/6/08	I'm serious. Moveon.com? The train is at the station. If you don't remember this, you're going to be in DT, deep trouble. I love this professor. Not only smart and a great professor, but funny too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Khondkar Karim	3.9	2	Business	335	3	5	4	5	955874	11/20/07	Awesome instructor! Very knowledgeable, helpful and genuinely interested in students' learning the material!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Kaseman	4.2	2	Chemistry		4	5	4	2	731387	2/26/06	Good teacher, very fair and also helped out if needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Kaseman	4.2	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	1	731387	2/7/06	Very laid back teacher, makes the class fun! Knows what he is doing.. most of the time, and isn't insanely strict on the lab reports like a lot of others are. Very fair also, I would personally keep taking his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	J Katz	4.6	2	Psychology		3	5	5	3	14787	11/6/05	Excellent, clear teacher. Helpful outside of class, too. Gave good examples to help you remember concepts. Loved her!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History	442	1	5	5	5	17499	12/21/11	Kaylani is the most powerful lecturer in the history department. Write down everything he says, and study for 10 hours. Roughly 1 in 10 students gets an A. It is true that he has no tolerance for total ignorance or intellectual illiteracy, so many students get shot down in class for not knowing the word "autarky" or Chomsky, Keynes, and Schumpeter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	2	17499	2/6/07	Great Teacher but makes you work extremely hard. The tests aren't to bad if you take good notes but make sure to study them. He doesn't require attendance but the things he says in class may not be in the book but WILL be on the test. Overall very good class extremely smart guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	4	17499	12/3/06	Hard, but great professor. Wants his students to understand history, not memorize dates. I enjoyed his class, and learned alot. If you listen to lectures and DO NOT MISS CLASS, and of course read you will do fine. Test based 90% on lecture material. Take him.. You will learn more.. Do not expect an A, but you will learn value of a good education.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	5	17499	11/10/06	Amazing amount of insight. Makes you want to learn the material outside of the class, which is something not many teachers can do. Sometimes I wonder why he teaches at a tech school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	3	5	5	17499	10/26/06	Probably the best teacher I've had to date. Doesn't waste any time, and knows so much about what he is talking about it sometimes scares me. Holds students up to the same standards to which I think he holds himself. He made me want to learn the material myself more than any other teacher I've ever, and that's the most important thing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	1	History		1	2	3	1	17499	3/26/06	If you want to read 30 pages a day for the rest of the quarter, take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	4	17499	4/29/05	Had Kaylani for European and Mid.East History. He is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. I feel like a much more educated person after having taken his classes. He is a touch teacher, but if you actually care more about your education instead of just your grades - TAKE HIS CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	1	History		2	2	4	NULL	17499	8/18/04	I took 3 courses with him because of his tough teaching style. Though I didn't do well in his classes, I learned much more from him than I would from other history professors (Newman is also great)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	1	History	302	1	2	3	NULL	17499	10/10/03	he sucks, puts down students, don't take
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	NULL	17499	8/30/03	One of the best teachers i've ever had. Extremely knowledgeable and motivated. He has a way of getting ahold of your attention and being interesting like no other teacher. He is demanding, and an excellent educator.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	0	History		2	2	1	3	17499	4/29/07	Can barely understand him, and cant read anything he writes. Constantly tells the students that they are stupid because they don't know some obscure fact in history. Even the kids that liked history got tired of talking and being told that their opinions were wrong. He teaches his view of what happened in history and is not open to debate about it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		3	4	5	3	17499	1/28/07	Modern European was one of the most intresting I've taken. Kaylani is easy to listen to and he is passionate about what he's teaching. Tests weren't hard as long as you went to class and paid attention. I'd like to take another class with him in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	5	17499	11/11/06	Out of any teacher I have ever had, I would say that Dr. Kaylani has had the greatest impact on my academic life. He is the first teacher that has made me actually enjoy history, and want to know more about it. Studying for anything became much more bearable, and even enjoyable after taking him. Because of this, my whole GPA went up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	5	17499	11/2/06	One of the most intelligent professors ive ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History	100	4	5	5	5	17499	9/21/06	Amazing Professor, will give you all the facts you need to know about the Middle East. Highly recomended. All you have to do is listen to class lecture and take notes to get east As in exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	2	17499	5/2/05	A very challenging but informative professor. Grades came from three multiple choice tests, no final. He has a ridiculous amount of insight into politics and history, and is a really nice dude (as long as you ask intelligent questions!) Would recommend for anyone seriously intersted in history.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	3	17499	10/2/04	The best professor I've had so far. Has a frighteningly sharp intellect and his lectures keep you hooked the entire time. He really made me want to learn the material. Dr. Kaylani should just open up his own institution. I'd go.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	1	History		1	2	3	NULL	17499	11/5/03	Very tough grader....grades came from only 3 tests and they were extremly hard...does not curve at all...notes are taken directly from his mouth, and he talks too fast and has an accent so its hard to understand...studied a lot but still did not do well..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History	103	3	5	5	NULL	17499	9/11/03	The only professor able to keep my attention at this abhorrent school. I wish I had taken more of his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	1	History		2	3	3	NULL	17499	2/26/03	Kaylani is like no other teacher you've ever had. His excitement over the material is evident in everything he teaches. He has pretty demanding expectations for his students, but all his tests are multiple choice (but usually difficult multiple choice).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	NULL	17499	2/19/03	very good, but tough
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		3	4	5	NULL	17499	10/23/02	Interesting professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	0	History		2	1	1	NULL	17499	2/19/03	Tough but very very good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nabil Kaylani	4.1	2	History		2	5	5	NULL	17499	10/28/01	Outstanding Teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		1	5	4	4	758435	4/15/10	Kearns was extremely passionate about accounting. His tests were hard, but if you studied then they weren't that bad. I think he's now retired though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		2	5	4	2	758435	10/26/09	He is a very kind person and really wants you to learn. Again the reading, not skimming, and studying are the key to his class. Once your done, you will know accounting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	1	Accounting		2	3	3	2	758435	2/2/09	I didn't care for his style of teaching. If you don't mind professors that assign reading and then homework based on it BEFORE they've taught it, then take this class! I found it difficult doing homework we hadn't learned how to do and it didn't really reinforce any concepts for me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		1	4	4	4	758435	5/3/08	A good professor, but may sometimes play favorites. As mentioned below, it can be very hard if you don't know much about Accounting to start with. Hard grader. Class average for tests are very low, with the last test around 40%. Curbs tests grades. but offers no extra credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		2	4	4	2	758435	12/2/07	Hard class if you do not know accounting. Very nice teacher willing to help at any time. Do all the homework and study like crazy and you will pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		1	4	4	3	758435	3/7/07	This is a very hard course for those of us that have never taken accounting before. It is A LOT of work and hard to get a good grade. However, the professor is very nice and his lectures are very clear. Homeworks due every class and please do study hard and smart for his exams, they are difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		2	5	4	3	758435	12/25/05	Excellent! Hard if you don't care about the class/do the work. As a professor one of the best I have had. Very Understanding, willing to help, straightforward, makes you feel comfortable. Understanding the material is the hard part... Take him. You won't regret it as long as you're willing to work (or have he time to work at it).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting	301	3	5	5	4	758435	2/18/10	He is a great teacher and really wants you to learn. He does collect HW every class, but as long as you attempt it you get credit. Recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting	301	1	5	4	5	758435	6/1/09	I took Intermediate Accounting 1 & 2 from Dr. Kearns 28 yrs ago at Frediona State College. Based on the comments that I see today, Dr. Kearns is the same. When you pass his course, you will know your stuff! He takes great care in helping folks that seek his help. Dr. Kearns is a very nice man & one of the most wounderful teachers in my college e
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting	101	1	4	4	1	758435	10/22/08	professor kearns is a great teacher if your an accounting major and want to thoroughly learn the topic; however, the class requires rigorous attention and reading everyday if you are to pass his tests.if financial accounting is required for your major and you want a decent grade, do not take him. i know many people who have withdrawn or failed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting	301	4	5	5	3	758435	2/5/08	Please pay attention and do the homework if you going to take his class. Very hard at the start if you don't know accounting, but with a little common sense you will be fine. Test seem easy to me and I only study 30 min per test but a lot of people fail. LOL. HE A EVERY HELPFUL TEACHER and one of the best teacher in RIT cuz his class not a BS class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting	101	4	5	4	3	758435	11/29/07	Make sure you do the homework and read the chapters. Going to class explains everything that is unclear. If you can do that you will get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		1	4	4	3	758435	2/12/06	if your not majoring in accounting, its hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francis Kearns	4.2	2	Accounting		2	4	4	1	758435	11/16/05	Very nice teacher, but if you don't do homework and stay on top of things, you will fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Keenan	4.3	2	Literature	502	2	5	5	5	1434694	4/27/11	In my first year, first quarter, I took Written Comm I with her. I thought she was scared teacher in the first place but in least of 2 weeks later, when you really work hard, she did not seem to be scared at all. She's cool teacher. However, she refused to give anyone an A for their final grade unless they work really, really, really hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Keenan	4.3	2	Literature		4	4	4	5	1434694	4/27/10	She's cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Keenan	4.3	2	Literature		4	4	4	4	1434694	11/8/10	i think shes the best teacher of all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	5	493382	7/9/09	As a teacher, Angela is not that great at covering fine, technical details. She expects you to get all that from the book, but doesn't really grade based on that (makes me uneasy considering that this was an intro course). Her critiques are what I'd take her class for. She can really read photographs, and gives helpful insights on your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	493382	2/18/09	Wonderful teacher! Loved her to death! Very helpful and very understanding. She requires a lot of work but you will learn from her. She believes in learning by doing. As a artist you have to perfect the technique yourself to learn it. You'll be lucky to get her as your photo teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	5	493382	8/18/07	LOVE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	1	Fine Arts		3	2	3	5	493382	10/16/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	5	493382	4/29/06	thought art work should be done her way (keep journals and such like she does), grades unfailry has favorites. although will listen for the most part if you talk to her about the unfairness of grades
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	493382	6/22/05	Great Professor. She pushes photo one students to be creative while still emphasizing technical information. My only complaint was the way she handeled critiques. I thought she went very easy on less than mediocre work. You can definitely slack in her class, but if you put in the time and energy you'll learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	493382	4/15/09	Angela understands the importance of a class that can slow down and really critique. Her realm is fine art/documentary. If that is what you're interested in, take her. I found her critiques very helpful and she is incredibly knowledgeable. Being self-motivated is important in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	493382	1/30/08	took her for 2 quarters pretty easy but def has her favorites, grades that way too. no encouragement for creativity, more tech stuff. Wouldn't take her again. Boring lectures.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	493382	6/2/06	made me love photo again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	3	5	493382	2/7/06	very laid back, assignments are pretty open to interpretation. notvery harsh in critiques, doesn't push much, but will support you if you go out of your way on an assignment or need help. also has the best anectdotes and funniest accent of all the photo teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Angela Kelly	3.5	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	5	493382	11/10/04	Was my Photography as a Fine Art II teacher for a full year. She is very easy going, nice and helpful. The only thing I did not like about her class was the reading response assignments - those tended to be quite boring, everything else in the class was enjoyable. Great teacher, great experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering	543	2	5	4	4	1453973	11/15/12	Much harder than other sections but you learn much more than you would. Grades very fairly but takes long to get back to you. Allows test corrections for half points back. Tests were difficult but not too bad if you understand the material. Very helpful when asking him questions but beware the stories, he likes to go on tangents.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering	543	5	5	5	5	1453973	2/27/12	Probably one of the best professors I've had at RIT. Very good at instilling interest in the subject too as well as teaching it. My only complaint is that he's unorganized when it comes to graded material. Both exams ended up being take home exams but I ended up learning a ton while doing them and understand the material better because of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	0	Engineering		1	2	2	4	1453973	10/31/11	Lousy at explaining things. He assumes that you can program already before taking the class which is not the case for many. Lab View is a terrible pain to work with. Often in class exercises are done entirely out of class. Does not teach something then expects students to figure it out. I found than Wellin is much more helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering	680	5	5	5	5	1453973	10/11/10	Dr. Kempski is the best professor in College of Engineering of RIT. If he teaches Chinese, take it. He knows how to teach. He taught in Automotive control Applications.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering		2	5	5	4	1453973	8/1/12	Awesome professor! I took him for System Dynamics and Design of Machine Elements. Great examples, most test are take home, though they're pretty challenging. His assignments take FOREVER to complete, but he's always there to help you out, even after hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering		4	5	3	3	1453973	2/26/12	He is a great guy and enthusiastic about what he teaches. He gets off track VERY easily and will tell you about the most useless stuff. He doesn't really do a good job explaining things in class at all, he more or less expects you to learn on your own which can be tedious if you've never programed with Labview before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Kempski	4.4	2	Engineering	280	4	5	5	3	1453973	1/29/11	Best teacher in dept at rit. He knows what he is doing. Had for MIC. easy class and he made it understandable. TAKE HIM
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	217	4	4	4	5	729685	10/2/12	Great professor, he was my favorite teacher I had during my first quarter at RIT. He will love you if he sees you taking notes during the first few weeks of class. Great guy, great teacher; take him if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	219	5	5	5	5	729685	2/3/12	great teacher and a damn sexy mustache
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	212	4	5	5	5	729685	11/22/11	Really helpful professor! Grades very fairly. Take if you can, you'll learn a lot and get an A if you try hard!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	360	4	5	4	1	729685	10/29/11	Great professor, nice sense of humor. He is clearly passionate about the subject and about helping students. The material itself was rather boring but he made it at least fun to come to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	218	3	5	5	4	729685	5/11/11	This guy is fantastic. Awesome mustache and a great prof. He is always skipping things over because he feels they are unnecessary, but then teaches them by showing you the code and going over it to make sure you understand. If you can take programming with him definitely do it great guy. If you don't need to but you want a cool elective go for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	210	4	5	4	3	729685	11/8/10	He knows his stuff and is very personable. Class discussion is strongly encouraged. He adjusts the content of the course based on his students needs (e.g. a game based lab for IDM students). You will learn the material and enjoy class if you take Kennedy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	4	3	3	729685	5/18/10	Hilarious guy. I always attended the lecture to hear the gems that he says in class. Teaching-wise he's mediocre at best.. Reads from the powerpoint and isn't very clear when you ask for clarification. Also grades at a snails pace.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	3	729685	10/19/09	Keeps the class interested. Easy to talk with. Helpful with any questions asked. Easy on grading. Do the practice exercises and homeworks and you'll do good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	402	3	4	4	1	729685	5/5/09	Cool guy, great sense of humor. Tries to make sure that students do not fail his class. Lecture is pretty boring however, occasionally he says something pretty funny, but reads from the slides and moves pretty quick.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	0	Information Technology		5	1	1	5	729685	1/29/09	Had him for OS scripting last quarter (thats me 11/7). HORRIBLE online professor. Never got around to answering questions, threw the projects at us and said "here ya go", with no useful material. If you have an online class with him, RUN AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	212	5	4	3	4	729685	2/27/12	Take him as a professor if you want an easy A, not if you need to learn the material well. He's great for the upper level prog-courses, but if you're just learning a language, you'll need a stronger foundation on which to build than the knowledge he'll provide. Great guy, semi-good professor. I would definitely take him for another class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	1	Information Technology	212	4	3	3	5	729685	11/26/11	Took Kennedy for Programming 3 (212) for ISF. His requirements are pretty unclear, we didnt get grades until week 8. Drops surprises on you and really doesnt know C++. Uses Windows and C++ and doesnt allow Linux or C programming. Pretty dull in lecture too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	360	5	5	5	2	729685	11/1/11	Kennedy is the man. Ridiculously lenient, loves his students, appreciates good humor... We had a lecture that lasted 30 minutes, and he spent the rest of class with the interpreter laughing at damnyouautocorrect. He's probably close to retiring, so take a class with him while you still can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	218	3	4	3	5	729685	8/2/11	Of the marginal programming teachers I've had at RIT, he is the best one. He does tons of code examples, which are extremely helpful. Nice guy once you get past the gruff exterior.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	729685	1/26/11	He is really good teacher. I would suggest you to take him whenever you can. He is very hilarious guy. He makes class more enjoyable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	3	729685	10/21/10	Being a mediocre programmer, Kennedy made everything crystal clear. Thoroughly explains everything in an interesting way, always does in class examples of code to further explain the lesson. Great sense of humor. Cares about student input so much he changed the format of class. EXTREMELY understanding. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	2	3	729685	11/24/09	Extremely experienced and understanding professor. He is more than willing to go over anything you don't understand. He is a bit tougher than other professors, but keeps it very fair. Not crazy about his teaching style, but if you can get him, take him. He's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		1	5	5	5	729685	5/24/09	Outstanding, professional very informative, fun to take classes from
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	0	Information Technology	402	3	1	1	4	729685	3/28/09	Avoid online classes with him at all cost. He's a nice guy, but doesn't seem to have much skill as a teacher. He cancels classes often, assigns projects with out explaining what he expects, breezes through lectures with out going into enough detail to be useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	4	729685	11/7/08	Great person, average professor. Likes to skip slides and tell stories instead of teach. Not very helpful during labs or class (likes to breeze on through), but if you go outside of class, he will help you as much as you need. His exams are stupid easy (generally exact copies of the labs). If you paid attention and did the labs its an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	318	3	5	5	5	729685	3/23/08	Great Professor. He asked me once, "Why are you even in IT??" now, I'm a professional in the field. He made me realize that I tried to hard...he's a great professor that explains everything...crystal clear!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	220	4	4	3	4	729685	10/24/07	Professor Kennedy is good teacher. He uses several examples from his vast experiences in the working world. Sometimes the info is alittle vague but overall its not too bad. Deadlines are imortant but will help you out if there is a problem, If you make an effort and show up you will do well. Studying helps too. Overall good guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	431	3	5	5	5	729685	4/27/06	That is one damme sexy mustache
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	2	729685	10/18/05	Great prof. Really cares about students and a fair grader. Thumbs up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	4	729685	2/5/08	He was very helpful. He told you useful information as well as his personal work experience. The material was covered through slideshows and lecture. The class was interesting and the workload was not bad. The only work that you had to do was just a whole (1) research paper of your choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology	400	4	3	4	1	729685	4/27/06	Coffee and a mustache...nothing more attractive on a man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Kennedy	4.1	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	729685	12/1/05	Dan's the man. Tries to get rid of the boring standard IT assignments and give you a more interesting one. Tests are fairly easy, if you pay attention in class, you're good, his test questions might have been in class exercises before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	230	4	5	3	4	402501	2/27/13	Good guy. The accent gets a little thick sometimes, but he knows his stuff and he's willing to help you understand it. Do the PEs and the HWs and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	1	Information Science	360	4	3	3	1	402501	11/1/12	Class isn't a breeze but if you pay attention, take notes and try you'll be fine. Accent is a bit hard at first you learn to get used to it. The amount of work is just about right as it applies what you learned in class but farther, you just have to look at his notes. Exam was fairly difficult, just study and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	1	Information Science	220	3	3	2	4	402501	5/3/12	Hard to understand for a bit, but his accent wears on u. He's fairly helpful but grades strictly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	574	5	5	5	5	402501	3/2/12	the best professor I have met
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	219	3	5	5	4	402501	4/15/11	Dr. Kang is a great professor. He truly knows how to teach his students. I had him for 218 and I liked him so much that I took 219 and 360(DB)with him as the professor. Also, he bends over backwards to help his students if they are respectful. I have received replies to my emails at midnight before. He gets back to you quickly and helps a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	1	Information Science		3	3	2	3	402501	1/27/11	Not a bad professor but sometimes is confusing and hard to understand
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	0	Information Science	219	1	3	1	4	402501	3/3/09	Kang's heavy accent is very difficult to understand. He is a nice guy, but very tough grader. Despite working very hard,I wasn't able to learn in his class. I later took the class with another professor and succeeded!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science		1	4	3	3	402501	3/18/08	Kang has a heavy korean accent. He is a tough professor who doesn't take crap from students, but he knows his stuff. (The man has 3 masters and a PhD) I took programming III with him and am now taking intro to database. Once you understand how he teaches you learn quite a bit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	0	Information Science		1	2	2	4	402501	6/1/06	Kang is a pretty good teacher, but he is not a good grader. very hard to get a good grade in his class. And TA is very important too, sometimes TA is very easy, but some TA just harder than professor. Professor only grade the practical test, and everything else is gradede by TA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science		2	5	3	4	402501	11/28/05	Very good programming professor. HW is difficult and very time consuming but that is how you learn it. But he is helpful if you're having trouble. Some may have difficulty with his accent, but you get used to it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	0	Information Science		2	2	2	3	402501	1/10/13	Not my favorite guy, to be honest. I found his accent a bit hard to understand, The accent would be so harsh if it didn't transfer to his slides and notes. The notes he provides at in huge quantity, but lack quality. Be ready to work in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	460	5	4	4	3	402501	9/12/12	Great teacher, easy as learning to ride a bike.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science		5	5	5	5	402501	3/2/12	I graduated from RIT almost 10 years ago. Professor Kang is best professor I have met. I want to thanks him for his guidance during my study in RIT and job searching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	360	5	5	5	5	402501	10/29/11	Took him for programming and for database. Kang is a master of all material that he teaches and is extremely good at teaching by example. If you make an effort to pay attention you will do well. Any complaints about his accent are baseless. I would take Kang over any professor any day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	218	5	5	5	4	402501	3/7/11	Professor Kang is the man, regardless of what others have said. He is the one who creates all the slides, and assignments for programming, and he has been using Java for decades. If you want an omnipotent professor, who will try his hardest to teach you, then you want Kang. He does have an accent, but only those who don't want to learn, complain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	218	3	4	3	4	402501	6/7/09	Kang is the man. I wish I had taken him for 219, but he didn't teach it in the spring. His accent is a little hard to get used to, but he definitely knows what he is talking about. Do the work and you'll do fine, and don't be afraid to e-mail him for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	219	2	3	5	5	402501	7/9/08	You can tell that Kang knows a lot about the material he teaches. The homeworks and practicals were all straightforward. The final project was a real challenge. He lets you choose your team, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T END UP WITH A BUNCH OF LOSERS because he WILL NOT give you a break. Your team all gets the same grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	0	Information Science	219	1	2	2	5	402501	3/12/07	I really disliked this teacher. He is very hard to understand, and he assumes that you will know everything like he does. He is brilliant and knows all his information, but he was hard to understand and learn from, especially, if your teaching/learning methods don't mesh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science	219	3	4	4	4	402501	2/28/06	Very good Programming Professor! He is a very strict grader, but will give the class extensions and curve the class grades if needed. He is hard to understand at first, becomes easier as the 1/4 progresses. Don't play games or IM durring his leectures, b/c he will KUNG-FU CHOPP YOU! As said before.. the final is very time consuming!!! beware!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science		4	5	4	5	402501	8/31/05	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jai Kang	3.7	2	Information Science		3	5	4	NULL	402501	5/5/04	JAVA NINJA!!! Best professor for the IT programming sequence (217,218,219), except for the 219 final project (client/server with bad model).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristin Kant-Byers	4.5	2	Anthropology	101	5	4	5	2	1630937	4/30/12	Lectures are easy to follow. Exams are easy if you pay attention. Do the readings for homework and you'll have an easy time. She's very nice as long as the class shows some interest in the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristin Kant-Byers	4.5	2	Anthropology	210	3	5	5	2	1630937	12/30/11	Such a great professor. Extremely helpful. Pay attention in class and do the readings - it will really show in your grade. Captivating lecturer, she has passion for what she teaches and it shows when she's lecturing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristin Kant-Byers	4.5	2	Anthropology		4	5	4	3	1630937	1/15/12	Lectures are very easy to follow, writes everything on the board. Discussions and test questions come from the readings. Tests consist of short answer and essays but are pretty simple if you pay attention in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristin Kant-Byers	4.5	2	Anthropology	210	3	4	4	2	1630937	10/25/11	Very clear professor. Lectures take place every day, but she lays it out in a way that is quite understandable. Tests are fairly simple, and if you pay attention in lectures and do all the textbook reading, you should do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Karpen	4.6	2	Fine Arts	101	5	5	5	5	484440	3/9/12	He totally changed my professional life. He was my Conceptual Photo instructor also and, as such, showed me how to see, not just render. As a student instructor's assistant, I had the honor to spend extra time with Prof. Karpen. What a wonderful man!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Karpen	4.6	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	484440	10/27/05	jack is a mix between jimmy stuart (personality and voice) mr. burns (looks) and he is the coolest teacher ever.. he has done it all..

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Karpen	4.6	2	Fine Arts		4	4	5	5	484440	10/24/05	Jack is such an amazing teacher. he will tell you exactly what you need to improve, and then expect you to do it. he could talk for hours about anyting that you wanted (ESP. WWII and Horses) He can make anyting interesting to learn as well! i just love him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Karpen	4.6	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	484440	4/28/05	Jack is totally awesome. He'll sit and talk with you about anything and he'll help you and give advice about your photography. Sometimes things are unclear, but he really relaxed and its a good class to learn about photography and not worry about messing up because thats what learning is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack Karpen	4.6	2	Fine Arts		3	5	3	5	484440	11/1/04	Very nice guy. Very relaxed. Knows what he is doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	1	Science		2	2	3	3	478701	11/18/09	Homeworks and lectures were both convoluted. Homework material was not taught and question were fairly confusing. Labs were not returned in a timely manor thus errors carried over into successive labs resulting in lower grades across the spectrum. Also would mention often that he couldn't teach at 8am...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	2	Science		4	5	4	5	478701	11/16/05	This class was very interesting and Dr. Kastner made it even better. Exams can be tricky if you dont know the material cold but is fairly lenient on the grading. The only thing he grades harshly are the lab writeups. Projects are intersting and pertain well to the course material. Looking forward to other classes with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	2	Science		4	5	5	3	478701	11/18/04	great teacher, very picky on grading labs though. allows a page of notes (typed small font) going into each test. If you get lower than a B you should re-evaluate how smart you think you are.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	1	Science		3	3	3	3	478701	10/25/04	Nice guy, I just can't figure out how a got a B, but someone I know who did lower quality work got an A. I don't think he did this on purpose, but It was disappointing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	2	Science		4	5	4	4	478701	1/26/09	Good teacher, exams and homework are straightforward, lecture is easy to follow, and he is approachable. He plays guitar in a band and is pretty laid back...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	2	Science		5	5	5	5	478701	9/19/05	Face it, this is man of the hour. Gives cool projects and lots of time. Yet you still learn. Invites interesting guests to come and speak.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Kastner	4.2	2	Science		3	5	4	2	478701	10/27/04	Nice guy. Good grader. Tells you EVERYTHING you should do to get an A. Funny at points but sometimes when you ask questions it can be difficult to understand the answer. If you try though he'll help. He definatly wants you to succeed in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Denise Kavin	4.0	2	Psychology	101	4	4	4	4	1486059	10/22/10	Willing to make the class interesting. Extremely helpful when possible and willing to answer and ask questions to make sure students understood the topic. Give students discussion and activities related to topics. Open-minded and very reasonable. Give some class time for guest speakers about job related to psych
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	475398	4/26/12	Took him for PLC and Intro to CsTh. His grading is fair and he covers all the material well, the lectures are boring but essential to the course because he follows a tight schedule. Average professor, but still better can most CS professors. Test are tough, but do the hw and projects well and you will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		3	4	3	4	475398	2/22/12	I mean, he's ok. Doesn't use MyCourses, nice but boring lectures. Programs on the whiteboard, hard tests, easy homework, easy programming assignments. Some might like him, I wouldn't take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	2	475398	3/7/11	He was a great professor for PLC. He explains the material very well and overall does a great job. Projects are fairly easy if you take the time to learn the languages. His tests directly reflect content presented in class. Study and you will do fine. He is always willing to answer questions in class and do extra examples if you ask him to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	0	Computer Science	450	4	2	1	2	475398	10/20/09	Projects are fairly easy, and he grades them easy too. Tests a quite a bit harder, but still very doable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	3	475398	10/19/05	This guy is out to lunch. He doesn't cover the matierial as well as it should be. Going to class is a waste of time. The projects are easy, but the Tests are very hard because he asks specific things that no one should need to know off hand! To bad he's the only one that teaches this class, all I can say is study the self review questions in the back of the book, and commit them to memory if you want to pass any of his exams. The final will be hell!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	4	475398	10/20/04	His exams were hard but if you do the work you'll do fine. Always very very helpful during office hours. Come to class. If you don't he may decide he doesn't like you and you'll be screwed. I was told he was evil but I really liked him. I would take him again if I could.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	2	475398	3/1/12	Easy-ish class, but he makes the lectures... boring. If possible, take this class with a different professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	475398	11/20/11	Very straight forward professor. The best CS prof I've ever had. Can be boring in lecture, but assignments are easy. Tests are VERY difficult, study hard and practice. Very open to office hours. Visit often and this will help your grade. He's a nice guy and will help with anything. The class attendance will help with assignments and tests as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	2	475398	2/21/11	One of the most helpful professors in the CS department at RIT. Willing to help students as much as they need. Tests reflect homework assignments and in class examples. Will go over examples in class as slowly as needed. Very helpful - take CS Theory and PLC with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science	380	3	4	4	2	475398	11/27/06	Tests are really tough, but if you do all of your homework and put forth a good effort, you will do alright in this class. He's not as bad as everyone says.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Fereydoun Kazemian	3.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	3	475398	5/2/05	Dullest teacher ever! But very good at explaining after class. Tests dangerous, lots of T/F hurt and hard grader (almost no partial credits). Assignments easy though. I recommend skipping class and attending his open lab sessions as the way to get the most out of him and his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Keefe	3.0	0	Political Science	101	3	1	1	2	886404	10/23/09	I had Foundations of Public Policy with Professor Keefe. He's a really kind hearted guy, but he is a terrible professor of the class that I took. Many times he did not know the information that he was trying to teach. The students corrected him constantly when he would make errors. Today I had a quiz on the readings. He did not know the right answ

Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	2	Environmental Studies		3	3	5	4	979133	11/17/12	I've had Dr. Keiner for several classes. She'll expect you to participate (and marks each time you participate per class discussion) and expect you to have done the readings. Assignments are straightforward so meeting the word minimum shouldn't be a challenge. Lectures can be boring. She's very socially awkward but she has good intentions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	2	Environmental Studies		4	3	4	1	979133	11/9/11	Great Professor for a seminar class. There is a lot of reading but the discussions are good. Assignments are straightforward and she grades them fair. For upper level classes she was very good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies	212	3	2	2	2	979133	2/9/10	She actually expects you to do all the readings. She doesn't put her powerpoints online. Test questions are pretty detailed. Writing assignments are pretty easy. I bet she scares a lot of freshmen away from the program. Don't take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies		2	2	2	4	979133	2/17/09	As with the other comments this teacher is very boring. She seems like she questions herself which makes her look like she's unprepared for every class. Her quizzes aka tests are ridiculous even if you read, the essays are a breeze though. If you have to rely solely on extra credit something's wrong. Avoid, or you'll need major caffeine to survive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies		3	1	2	2	979133	1/28/09	never directly answers questions, gives way to much reading while claiming she should give more. tests are ok, but she grades like an english teacher. meh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies		3	2	1	3	979133	11/14/08	Very boring teacher. Cant understand what she is saying. Gives 25 page articles to read for every class. Tests not that hard if you study. She gives study guides and essay questions prior. Gives extra credit for events. Ok to tale if you can stay awake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies		1	1	2	2	979133	10/22/12	She does....knows her stuff. Not a great teacher. Class is not worth time if you are only taking it for concentration or minor. Not a fun class, too many guest lecturers, too many boring field trips, 8-10 page essay. Many other essays, tons and tons of readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies	212	2	1	2	1	979133	2/17/10	This lady is insane... Her powerpoints are useless because her lectures are boring; she doesn't put the powerpoint up online either... There's a lot of reading to do for this class and the essays are not easy, but not real hard; I still relied more on my essay part of both tests for my grade. Save yourself and don't take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies	212	4	1	3	4	979133	11/19/09	Really easy topic but terrible teacher.Powerpoints are all pictures,so boring.She's nuts.Assigns way too much reading and expects you to remember certain authors/articles on the exams.Avoid her if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	1	Environmental Studies		3	2	3	3	979133	2/2/09	Crazy teacher. Will give you extra credit for easy assignments though. The only good part of the class was making fun of her with the rest of the students. She's scatterbrained and doesn't grade fairly. Don't take her class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	0	Environmental Studies		3	2	2	5	979133	12/11/08	Terrible teacher. I'm a mid-liberal person who is a conservationist and environmentalist-- this woman is NUTS. Beyond left wing retard. Way too heavy on the book, boring boring lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Keiner	2.2	1	Environmental Studies		4	3	3	1	979133	3/17/08	Scatter brained but not that hard. As long as you can make it through the boring lectures you should be fine. Lets you miss 2 classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Kemp	5.0	2	Not Specified	607	5	5	5	5	635549	2/8/12	awesome teacher!! easy class. she is so funny. it was my favorite class of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Kemp	5.0	2	Not Specified	101	5	5	5	3	635549	5/20/08	awesome teacher. Hilarious and generally cares about her students. Has college son so she is very good at relating to students and what goes on in their lives.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Kemp	5.0	2	Not Specified	201	5	5	5	4	635549	2/9/11	Great teacher. Knows what she is talking about and has actual experience. Very understanding and always is a help. Tests are pretty good and all around great teacher and class. I would recommend her if you can get her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Kemp	5.0	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	5	635549	6/23/05	Easiest professor, even easier class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy  Kendell	1.5	0	Environmental Studies		3	1	2	2	1754464	10/16/12	She always comes late and tells her life story. I did not learn anything
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		1	2	5	2	66038	2/28/12	Alright guy. Don't get on his bad side, ever. Definitely a strict grader and refuses to regrade. Decent teacher although he does go through examples extremely fast. Definitely prepares students well for the exams but in doing so students will need to do significantly more work than other students in other sections. All in all, a very "meh" prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science	313	2	4	5	4	66038	10/19/10	If you want to learn and you respect Kern, he will show you respect and be very helpful. If you think he should give you a grade rather than earning one yourself, he won't lift a finger to help you. A very reasonable professor who is fair with his grading. Sure, the class is hard, but it's hard material. Be ready to work. Don't talk during class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science	313	3	4	4	5	66038	4/24/10	He's not bad. He does get offended easily at people talking in class, but he's helpful during office hours, tells you exactly what's on each test, and his lectures are useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		1	1	2	2	66038	2/17/10	Very mean teacher. Will refuse to teach class if only a few are talking, and won't think twice about throwing an entire table of people out of class. Avoid this teacher. Other than that, he is very knowledgeable in physics, hints at questions on the test, even though the test average is usually a 50.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		2	1	1	4	66038	5/31/09	He was a horrible professor. Although I did get extra credit on a test because I asked him his opinion on Pluto being a planet or not. Supposedly Pluto is his favorite planet. Ask him his opinion during class to gain this extra credit, you'll need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	1	Science	313	1	3	3	3	66038	11/9/08	Not too good of a professor. His lectures don't usually help you too much, as he speeds through them way too fast. His grading was fair. Overall, I think this professor needs to shorten his lectures and allow students to struggle on problems associated with a particular topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		2	2	2	4	66038	10/25/07	Very good at physics, but expects you to already know everything that he "covers". Do not take if you like teachers who actually teach, dont expect a good grade unless you already know physics. Otherwise, fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		2	2	1	1	66038	1/31/07	Prof. Kern is a very smart man, and makes sure that you know it. He finds the material so easy that he expects his students to know more than they do. The course is challenging with Prof. Kern. Students will teach themselves and each other quite a bit. Prof. Kern is certainly not the star teacher of the physics dept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science	311	3	2	1	4	66038	10/23/06	wow, this guy sucks the big one. Mean, and just generally unpleasent. No help out of class and a real bore actually in one!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		4	5	5	4	66038	4/12/05	Super nice and very easy to follow if you pay attention. Have yet to take two more exams, but so far his class hasn't been difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science	321	2	3	4	3	66038	1/10/11	Nice man, just not a very good professor. He speeds through examples too fast. If you want to learn you are going to have to seek help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	1	Science	313	2	1	5	2	66038	7/28/10	VERY smart. Very opinionated. Very dominate. Stopped class about once a week for people talking, laughing etc. Harassed students about not knowing things. Badgered one student and listed 10 reasons the kid shouldn't be in class (cause someone beside him was talking). Told the class he almost wrecked his car and he "knows we all wish he died".
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science	313	1	1	2	3	66038	2/25/10	Kern is the worst professor I've yet had at RIT. His method of teaching is simple: Speed through examples at the speed of light and yell at you if you ask a question. He yells at everyone all the time, completely unprovoked. Incredibly rude and terrible teacher. AVOID!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		1	1	2	4	66038	6/11/09	Yo man the guy below is right. Ask him about his opinion on Pluto being a planet or not during class to get these extra points. I was in his class that quarter. BTW the professor is terrible at teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science	313	1	2	2	4	66038	5/27/09	Kern is the worst professor I have ever had. I did well in physics 2 and 3, but this class was awful. He is a though grader, gives no partial credit, and gives more focus to notation than the actual answer. I would not recommend him at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science	311	4	4	4	3	66038	10/26/07	Pretty good, anyone who thinks his tests are too hard is crazy, fairly good teacher overall, covers the material well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		3	5	4	3	66038	10/10/07	good teacher, likes physics
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		2	1	2	3	66038	11/8/06	This professor is BAD. He ridicules you if you dont understand the material. Exams are rediculously hard. Unless you know physics inside and out, you wont do well. Doesnt teach anything in the text but expects you to know everything cold. He once kicked a student out of class for not knowing an idea that was never really mentioned. Avoid Kern
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		2	1	1	1	66038	10/18/05	Very Unclear, end up teaching yourself all the material. Webassign and Tests astronomically harder than in class activities.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	4	66038	10/26/04	really bad... on par for rit's physics department.

Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		4	5	5	NULL	66038	2/23/03	Simply the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	66038	10/1/02	he is the bomb one of my favorite pphysics professors
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	NULL	66038	5/15/04	one of the most mean-spirited and unhelpful people i've ever met. never mind how he his as a professor (which he's bad at), he's just a rotten person overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	0	Science		1	3	1	NULL	66038	5/3/04	His lectures were completely over the heads of 70% of the class, who got at most a D. He is very helpful in office hours, but horrible in lecture. Not enough submissions on webassign hw, and hard quizzes and tests that were way too long.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	66038	4/24/03	Easy to understand...lectures are a little boring but always tons of help during office hours. Quizes are tough but exams aren't too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kern	2.7	2	Science		2	5	5	NULL	66038	10/5/02	one of my favs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Khazanchi	4.3	1	Business		1	2	3	5	1260439	11/16/12	Very tough grader. The lowest case will be dropped and you really have to used all the concepts in the cases to have a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Khazanchi	4.3	2	Business	755	4	5	5	4	1260439	11/12/12	I loved the course. Highly recommend this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Khazanchi	4.3	2	Business	740	4	5	4	2	1260439	2/15/10	Professor did a good job at incorporating interesting case studies and activities to teach concepts. One of the most useful courses I've ever taken!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Khazanchi	4.3	2	Business	755	3	5	5	4	1260439	11/12/12	I am engineering student and took this course as an elective. I feel that this should be a required course for all students. She is fantastic professor and really knows her stuff. What I learned in this course will be useful through out my career.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shalini Khazanchi	4.3	2	Business	740	4	5	4	3	1260439	1/28/11	Amazing teacher. I would highly recommend to all. She runs an open discussion class so class participation is very important. Do not show up late and you will do well in this class. Keeps even a 3 1/2 hour class interesting the entire time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	5	4	5	2	1082921	11/16/12	I didn't like him at first, but it wasn't until the first exam that I realized how much I learned. Attendance is mandatory, but he is a good professor so you aren't wasting your time. He may be hard to understand at times with his choices of words, but his grading is extremely fair. I recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	5	5	4	2	1082921	5/17/12	Hard to understand at times but extremely easy and awesome as a professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	0	Mathematics	451	2	1	3	5	1082921	1/10/11	He's mean when you ask questions, he even made me cry when I went to him for help! Expects students to spend 3-5/hrs/day just for his class, outside of class. Quiz questions come out of no where, his "easy" tests aren't so easy, and if avg test grade is 55, he's okay with that, as long as one person does well. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	0	Mathematics	319	2	2	1	1	1082921	2/10/10	One of the worst professors I have ever had. Blames low test grades on students though when teach material is very unclear on topics. Very degrading towards students, and almost impossible to contact. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	5	4	3	4	1082921	2/24/09	Really nice guy. Has an accent, but if you're actually paying attention it doesn't really get in the way. Homework wasn't bad at all, quizzes were pretty easy and he was liberal about open-note/book on occasion. Class itself isn't too difficult at all. Reasonable about grades if you approach him about it. I'd take him again if I got the chance,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	3	3	1082921	1/28/09	He is helpful, but people don't approach him often. He makes lecture notes and puts them on his website, so it's very easy to study. I would highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	0	Mathematics	351	1	1	1	4	1082921	12/26/07	Prof Kim is very difficult to learn from. He has a heavy accent, so info is hard to receive the first time around. He is unapproachable for questions, so you can't get it the second time around either. His tests are much harder than the accompanying study guides. There is either a test of homework due every class, so you can't miss one. Avoid Kim.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	1	1082921	10/4/12	Very nice guy. The mandatory attendance is annoying (takes off points for missing class). Pretty good at explaining the material. Uses a lot of poker-related examples. Pretty funny, throws random jokes in class. Tests are fairly easy, worksheets not so much. Homework is straight from the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	0	Mathematics	345	4	2	2	1	1082921	10/13/11	Prof. was difficult to understand, doesn't stop for understanding during lecture. Learned very little from class but had to go for worksheets given in class. Online notes were decent. Learned better from book and note than class. Rushes through lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	2	4	3	4	1082921	8/24/10	Lots of assignments to boost your grade. Tests are fair. Homework can sometimes be very long but usually is 1-2 hours. Accent was not an issue for me although if you know you have trouble understanding teachers with accents you may have a hard time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	4	3	1082921	12/1/09	Such a great professor, really nice guy and made things easy to understand.. some lectures were dry but half class time was lecture while half was a group worksheet (really helped boost grade) offered some extra credit and took students opinions into consideration a lot. I'd take a class from him again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	0	Mathematics	351	1	2	1	1	1082921	2/23/09	Kim has a heavy accent. It is difficult to understand him in class. Homework assignments did not help. Topic is very dry and boring as well. Attendance is not mandatory but he likes to give extra credit points (up to +10%) on exams for attening class. This did not help me. I will need to take this class a third time. Avoid Kim.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chulmin Kim	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	3	5	4	5	1082921	8/20/08	Kim is very friendly and highly approachable. Sometimes he may not explain clearly during class, but if you attend office hours he makes things very easy to understand. You'll have to work to get the A, but he will help you achieve your goal if you actively try to. An excellent professor; not the best, but still a great guy I'd take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	401576	10/18/05	Good teacher. Thumbs up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	401576	12/21/04	The best teacher on Liberal Arts courses so far. Always willing to make the class flow better and to help you get the grade you need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	NULL	401576	5/15/04	Very Nice, makes class fun, posts power point slides online, which makes it much easier to take notes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	401576	8/31/05	take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	401576	10/24/04	One of the best at RIT. Had fun having my Intro to Psychology class. Always willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nancy Kim	5.0	2	Psychology		3	5	5	NULL	401576	5/4/04	She's smart and funny and she knows how to keep people interested in the material. I wish she taught more classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	0	Chemistry	251	1	2	2	3	903523	11/18/11	set up the class around peer learning. COMPLETELY USELESS IF YOU END UP WITH A BAD GROUP. if asked for help, he gives vague hints. no tutors can help b/c the class setup is the only one in RIT. lectures were barebones & confusing. avoid this class at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry	217	4	4	5	4	903523	6/30/08	went to class, sat towards the front, took notes, did all the online hw's, didnt have to study a long time for the tests, scored an A in the class. he's a very funny, down-to-earth guy and i enjoyed his class a lot. definitely worth taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry		5	4	5	3	903523	2/18/08	taught the materials really well. made class enjoyable and chemistry tolerable. show up to classes and take notes. online assignments aren't bad. tests are based on notes. a little effort guarantees an A :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry		5	4	4	4	903523	2/3/08	Had him for Gen & analytical lecture. He's a funny guy. I already knew the material he was teaching but I think he covered it well enough. If you can do chemistry the tests aren't hard. Seems very nice, but only talked to him once.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	1	Chemistry		4	3	3	3	903523	10/23/06	Took him for gen&analytical chem. Decent prof. 3 tests + optional final if you want to raise your GPA. A few quizzes and weekly easy homework. His teaching style is ok, a little vague at best. Tests are free response, so slightly harder than Langner's. He uses dorky examples to get concepts across, but isn't a bad guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry	101	4	5	4	5	903523	10/13/10	He's a great guy and very down to earth. He understands problems and helps you deal with them. Though he is a joker he can be very serious when the time is right. I would recommend his class to everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	1	Chemistry		1	3	3	2	903523	3/17/08	He is enjoyable to listen to and keeps things interesting. This doesn't help you on the tests however. There are only a few tests and they are very difficult. There are no homework or quizzes to help bring your grade up. Also don't expect him to bump your final grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	4	903523	2/4/08	Very clear and organized. Writes all the notes on the board, so you'll always get them. Has a sense of humor and is very approachable. Tests are easy and a mock test is usually given. Homeworks are online and graded by effort. I would recommend him over any other chem professor here at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kim	3.8	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	3	903523	3/6/07	Lively lecture, rarely fall asleep. Likes to random stories about his family. Don't rely on "practice exams" too much: they basically contains topics that mostly will NOT be on the test. Claims to be flexible in grading, but doesnt like to discuss pts. very arbitrary grading scheme. all open-ended questions. lose pts on things not covered in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature	505	3	5	5	4	346601	10/29/12	One of the best teachers on campus, if you have the chance to have her. TAKE HER. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		4	5	5	3	346601	2/7/12	love her, she was so easy and fun to have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature	111	2	5	5	5	346601	5/13/08	Amazing teacher, with patience and enjoyment with students. Strict but fun and good to learn from her. Gave us extra homework, which it helped us to be prepared for challenging writing. Take her! :]
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		5	5	5	1	346601	2/1/05	just wowerz.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		4	5	5	5	346601	4/18/12	This teacher is such an amazing woman! She teaches writing very well and she is very creative and helpful teacher. I highly recommend you guys to take her for writing seminar or any liberal art course. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		2	5	5	5	346601	1/24/11	This class may be challenged but worth to learn from her. She's sarcastically funny. I had to laugh my butt off when she makes a scene. Take it with HER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		3	5	5	5	346601	9/14/05	She is very awesome and open-minded. I know that course is very stricted and it don't bother me in general. She is making sure if the students understand clearly and warn them what is coming up next like tough challenge for us. I like that and it helps me to be aware about tough challenge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Kincheloe	4.9	2	Literature		3	4	5	NULL	346601	8/16/04	a feminist even though she denies it. can be a bit crass at times but makes class all the more interesting. on-line quizzes, only four papers to do. very helpful and can be flexible if you maintain good grades and show eagerness to learn. take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Kinsman	1.5	0	Imaging Science	211	1	1	2	4	1752136	10/5/12	Has been programming for 20 years and teaches as if to students who have been doing it for just as long.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arturo Kiyama	2.0	0	Psychology	440	1	2	2	3	1750745	9/29/12	The lectures were very hard to follow as he went off on tangents all the time. The interpreters in my class even got so bored they started leaving out huge sections of the lectures. The tests were very difficult as almost nothing on the test was in the lecture and went into great detail on things that seemed completely unrelated to what we learned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology	210	5	3	3	2	288262	5/17/12	Really easy. There were 5 tests with 5 minutes of open book open notes at the end of each one. Lectures from powerpoints on mycourses
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology	210	5	2	3	2	288262	12/4/10	You only have a few multiple choice test for the class, and there is no cumulative final. Her lectures are a big snooze fest though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	0	Psychology	350	5	2	1	1	288262	10/23/08	The textbook taught me the better than her teaching!! So dull, unpleasant voice to listen for two hours,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology		5	3	2	2	288262	9/13/07	I actually have her for psych stats and I cannot tolerate the way she teaches. It's not informative, it's condescending and she rambles. If there's any other prof's teaching this, take them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	0	Psychology		5	2	2	5	288262	10/19/04	You're better off taking the online course. same reading material w/o sitting in class 4hr/wk listening to her nonsensical regurgitation (straight from the book btw) and useless anecdotes. Easy tests (10pt extra credit on each) Non comprehensive finals, with EC. I have over 100 average in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	2	Psychology	508	5	4	5	4	288262	1/15/11	Had for Intro Psych. Everything is in the textbook, which is long but interesting. Lectures are powerpoint and notes on the board, with her personal examples. Tests are easy multiple choice, and no Final. Friendly, approachable, easy teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology	210	5	3	2	1	288262	10/26/10	Quizzes are easy, but the class is extremely boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	0	Psychology		5	1	3	2	288262	10/16/08	I had her for both Industrial Organizational Psychology and Psychology of Personality, in both classes the tests were a joke. Personality was basically Intro all over again and IO was just plain boring. Easy A for both.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology		4	2	3	4	288262	2/6/06	She is without a doubt the most boring teacher ever. She just rambles on about her life and talks straight from the book, and even so she can't stay on track with the syallabus. To prove this ****, her tests are so easy: I skipped an entire week or so before the first test, found out we had it that morning and studied for a hour or so and got 1
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cheryl Kleist	2.5	1	Psychology		4	3	2	NULL	288262	11/16/03	Sometimes I wonder why she has a doctorate...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	111715	6/20/08	hey kids lets learn flash and make more garbage to look at on the internet. I had to drop out because this was too hard for me and bill couldn't explain a damn thing clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	3	111715	1/20/06	We had 1 lecture class and 1 class in the lab. For the lecture class he made us read the material and present it to the class in groups. He couldn't even teach it himself, he made us try to make sense of it. And then after that he just showed example work for the rest of the quarter. I don't know how anyone could learn a computer program like that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	111715	10/11/05	what an ****....shittest teacher I have ever had!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	111715	9/1/05	favorite prof at rit. the rest of the design staff pales in comparison. go bill!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	1	Graphic Arts		4	2	3	4	111715	4/3/05	so-so, and sometimes moody
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	4	5	NULL	111715	5/15/04	very chill dude, very informative and also pushes you to learn on your own as well. If youre into experimental design talk to this guy! good class

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	5	4	111715	2/1/07	Very laid back professor, only two projects for the quarter...rewards attendence but allows you to miss two, critiques honestly but helpfully, grades very fairly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	111715	1/19/06	It seemed like he was teaching like everybody already knew the program, and many people told him was going to fast and he just got mad. didn't really teach anything, he just went over a few basic things! and then expected everyone to breeze through it?! he also makes you feel stupid when asking for help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	5	111715	9/29/05	he pretty much just sucks. in general. as a professor- definitely. as a person- even though it's not as important as his teaching skills-yes. he is not helpful, he is moody, he does not give good feedback, and he makes you feel extremely uncomfortable if there's the slightest chance that you don't know what you're doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	0	Graphic Arts		3	1	1	5	111715	4/26/05	Very moody. Vague with assignments. Needs to learn how to constructively criticize students instead of just yelling at them. Told us our work made him want to puke.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	1	Graphic Arts		3	2	3	NULL	111715	5/15/04	goes pretty quick with his teaching skills...kool done to earth guy, but needs to understand everyone does not learn that fast and has the "talent" like he does!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	4	NULL	111715	9/4/03	He's a cool guy to be around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Klingensmith	2.8	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	3	NULL	111715	1/16/03	good guy... vague projects
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald  Kent	3.0	1	Accounting	530	5	4	2	4	1776869	12/6/12	NOT a good teacher. Did not get assignments back in good time, could not follow the syllabus. We had our first exam half way through the quarter; received it back the last week to withdraw. I learned nothing and re-took the course the next quarter. Worst course I have taken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	1190006	4/8/13	After over 20 ratings he has an overall helpfullness of 5.. i think u get the point... great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1190006	4/11/12	One of the best professors at RIT. He is a pretty lenient grader and is there to help you if you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	712	3	5	5	3	1190006	3/5/12	My favorite
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	1190006	1/7/12	excellent, very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	5	5	1190006	11/24/10	Truly the best professor I've had so far. He was hilarious (had the interpreter crying from laughing so hard) and really nice and always stopped to make sure the class was following what he said. Emails mandatory review packets along with the solutions before tests that are really helpful in studying. I can't wait to take another class with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	711	2	5	4	4	1190006	11/20/10	Always willing to help. He is genuinely concerned that students have a good grasp on the material, and will listen to any suggestions you have about the class. Don't be afraid to take a higher level class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	713	3	5	5	4	1190006	8/6/10	Simply great. Very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	1190006	2/22/10	Very nice guy, very helpful. if you dont understand something he will try to help you the most he can. Test and quizzes very easy. Overall very great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1190006	2/4/10	Taught our class for one day and taught related one of our math problems to the game Cricket. No explanations necessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1190006	10/23/09	Made differential equations super easy. Great at explaining concepts. Gives you a ton of occasions to rise your grade. Very, very helpful. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1190006	5/16/12	Wonderful teacher, makes sure everyone does well. He genuinely cares about his students and is extremely helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	859	3	5	5	4	1190006	3/8/12	Very hard course but extremely useful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	859	3	5	5	3	1190006	3/5/12	The best course ever. Learnt a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	5	5	1190006	5/23/11	Awesome teacher. Loves what he does and great at it. Cares about his students. He's great at explaining and re-explaining, and offers lots of chances to make things up. Funny, too. The only thing I dislike about him is that he doesn't teach many more of my classes. :-(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	5	4	1190006	11/21/10	Dr. Khan is an excellent professor. He is always willing to explain any questions. His class was always a pleasure to attend and everyone was engaged. I cannot wait to take another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	512	2	5	3	4	1190006	10/19/10	If you take an upper-level class, you may be confused by his notations. He tends to assume his students are smarter than they are and tries not to offend them by teaching them what they already know. This makes upper level classes difficult. He is very entertaining and nice. Very smart guy. Take him if you find other professors slow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	306	5	5	5	4	1190006	5/24/10	One of kindest people you will ever meet. He actually cares about his students. The quizzes and tests are easy and if you do poorly, he will find ways for you to get back some points. Excellent professor and very good person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1190006	2/7/10	He is more like a high school teacher than a college professor(In terms of caring). There is no other professor at RIT that cares more than him. He is very knowledgeable, approachable and he tries more than you for you to be successful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	1190006	10/23/09	Such a caring teacher, he gave me a birthday card! One day I was an hour late and he said he was sad. Everyone respects him because he respects the students, front row filled. When he makes mistakes, he feels really bad and apologizes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	123	3	4	4	3	1190006	8/26/09	I had Akhtar for all three of the Project-based Calculus classes. Each of which consisted of a weekly homework workshop and quiz/exam (3 exams not including the final). These all counted towards your grade but what really counted was your attitude towards the class and your ability to show Akhtar that you learned something. Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	123	4	5	5	4	1190006	4/9/09	Probably the greatest Teacher I had freshman year. He knows his math and he is extremely knowledgeable. He actually cares about how you are doing and if you are learning. Really nice guy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	282	4	5	4	5	1190006	1/23/09	had him two semesters in a row and absolutely loved the class...looking forward to having him for 283 and also a couple elective classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	361	3	5	5	3	1190006	12/18/08	Genuinely nice guy. Made you feel like he was actually concerned about you as an individual. Covered the material well, i actually felt like i learned something. was always available for help and even gave us opportunity for undergrad research!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	1190006	2/4/09	The best calc teacher I've ever had! Explains everything crystal clear, makes sure you get it, concerned bout you as an individual. Whatever's on the test/quiz- goes over in class before/is taken from the hw. Attendence mandatory thou.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Akhtar Khan	4.8	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	4	3	1190006	1/22/09	Amazing professor, By far the best Math teacher I have ever had, Will explain everything you can ever want as long as you ask

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajat Khullar	5.0	2	Design		4	5	5	4	956938	2/8/07	He was very helpful and he always made sure that everyone was on the same page. Projects were not hard at all, and all he really required for them is that you put in a little thought.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dongryul Kim	2.6	2	International Studies	214	3	5	3	4	1342641	2/7/12	He's very funny and he knows it, so his classes are quite humorous. Really difficult quizes but easy tests. He curves the grades so almost no one can fail. Really friendly and nice. International Relations grade based on tests, quizes and a group project. The textbook is important. Also he offers extra credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dongryul Kim	2.6	0	International Studies		1	1	2	1	1342641	11/1/09	Boring material; book is useful but dull. He is funny but hard to understand. The intro course should be easier than this.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dongryul Kim	2.6	1	International Studies	211	2	4	2	4	1342641	2/17/10	If you don't read the books, you will not do well! It's all up to the student. This is not a course in which you can be lazy and get an A. great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dongryul Kim	2.6	0	International Studies	214	2	2	2	4	1342641	10/27/09	hard to understand (accent-wise). lectures are useless; the tests are all on things you learn in the textbook, and his lectures are mostly off topic. hard quizzes, moderately easy tests, lots of reading for homework. a lot of people drop his classes and he uses a curve so almost no one fails. funny to listen to. take his classes at own risk
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	2	Engineering		4	5	3	3	1099403	1/17/13	To everyone that says he is a hard professor, or received any great lower than a B... you are an idiot and need to leave RIT. His classes a based on the amount of effort you are willing to put into it. You do the work, you get a good grade, simple as that. He is helpful if you dont understand and he is quick to respond by email. He is great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	1	Engineering		5	3	3	5	1099403	11/10/11	hes gotten a lot better. but there is definitely a communication issue sometimes. if you do the worksheets he hands out, you WILL learn. and if you need clarification, he always does his best to answer. he is usually in a jovial mood, so its never too tense during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	301	1	1	1	1	1099403	10/25/10	HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!the wrost teacher you can imagine. he is a total jerk and full of himself. has no respect for student or other falcuties, and his teaching method is uncoprehendable. avoid him at any price and if you do happen to take him, you would be lucky to even get a C. he is just impossible to work with and is not dependable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	416	3	1	1	1	1099403	2/10/09	As the others stated stay away!! worst teacher ever cant under stand a word he says. Dont even think about asking a question, the answer will be nothing close to what you wanted. Ive also herd from the grapevine that hes even a backstabber in the work place.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	304	3	2	1	3	1099403	10/6/08	Impossible to understand at times, lingually and academically. Does not appear to understand the course material. Loses assignments and refuses to take blame for it. I would personally avoid this professor if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering		2	1	1	1	1099403	9/7/12	Avoid taking a course with him at all costs! Words can't describe how bad he his, and he'll even make you wear a lab coat for why I have no idea, perhaps to embarrass himself and his students......
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	416	1	1	1	3	1099403	1/27/11	If you can, never take a class from Prof. Kim, but I think RIT makes it imposable not to. Can't understand anything he is saying, Just read the book and ignore him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	416	1	1	1	1	1099403	11/9/09	Useless professor. Doesn't answer questions, tells students one thing & then does another, changes class schedule layout on a weekly basis (promises Fridays as online lectures with no attendance required, and then gives an attendance quiz to the few that happened to catch his schedule changing email & make it to campus in time!) Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Kim	1.7	0	Engineering	304	4	1	3	2	1099403	1/28/09	Totally full of himself. Bold faced liar. Agree that he looses assignments. Cant understand him at all. His english comprehension is nearly non existant. You can send him an email and he responds "very good" without answering any questions. That is if he even reads it. If you ask him about it, he will deny even getting an email from you. Avoid!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Kimble	4.5	2	Biology		4	5	5	1	1251358	5/7/09	Loved Kimble, she's really nice and extremely helpful. Grades are fair and her quizzes are pretty average in terms of difficulty. Take her if you can, best lab prof I had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Kimble	4.5	2	Biology		4	5	4	3	1251358	3/10/09	Best bio lab professor there is. Funny and really helpful. You'll always be out early since the labs don't take the whole 2 hours. Getting an A is as easy as just going to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Kimble	4.5	2	Biology	206	2	5	3	1	1251358	3/12/09	Very knowledgeable, helpful, and easy-going during labs. Her quizzes and practicals can be very tough, but she's always approachable and eager to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Kimble	4.5	2	Biology	102	4	5	4	2	1251358	1/29/09	sweet proff, she's easy going and very helpful. Preferred over Morgan.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	1	Communication		5	3	3	3	959837	1/25/11	A nice teacher. I personally liked her. I found her funny and got an easy A in her class. I don't see why people disliked her. She retired after Spring 2010
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication	101	1	1	1	1	959837	2/16/10	Dear lord listen to people here when they say do not take her class. I thought it wouldn't be that bad, but YES IT IS. Stay away, stay far away. She doesn't explain anything and expects you to know everything, and if she doesn't like you, you could turn in A+ material and get a C. She is by far the worst professor I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	2	Communication	350	2	5	4	4	959837	9/18/09	If your a PR major Wilma King is the greatest professor you can have. Her assignments are very effective at preparing students to enter the field. She doesn?t behave like a professor and more like a supervisor. I learned more in one semester in her class than three years with other instructors. If you?re a slacker don?t take her class, but if you w
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication	101	5	1	1	4	959837	3/19/09	Everyone else is right. This is absolutely the worst Professor. Do not take her courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication		3	2	2	4	959837	3/27/08	She is outstanding at being a horrible teacher. She is unfair at giving all her students a fair chance to excel. She grades as follows: if she likes you, you are rewarded with an A if not you are guaranteed a C or lower. You will learn NOTHING in her class. BEWARE..DONT TAKE HER, YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAREER DEPENDS ON THIS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication		2	1	1	3	959837	1/28/08	She chose favorites early on and gave them more opportunities to succeed (i.e. gave them easier topics for their projects and gave more time on presentations). She did not explain the material or the assignments very well and spent a lot of class time talking about unrelated material. If you want a fair education and grade, do not take her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication		2	1	1	5	959837	6/27/07	Honestly the worst teacher you could ever have. Her assignments make no sense, so good luck trying to figure out what she wants. She gives unfair grades and picks favorites. You also will learn nothing in her classes. PR classes may sound like a fun elective, but trust me, not when they are with her! To bad some of us have to take her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	1	Communication	101	5	3	2	4	959837	2/17/10	Prof King is a nice woman but you may as well not come to class. She doesnt grade for attendance or participation and her grading on the papers is pretty easy. And she is very easy to suck up to. She lets you decide what the final and midterm projects will be. Basically she is a boring teacher and needs to grow a pair if you know what i mean
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication	535	4	1	2	3	959837	2/1/10	Absolutely horrible. I did not learn a thing. Goes off on random stories not relevant to class or projects. Our entire class consisted of writing ONE plan. The midterm was open book, oral, and in a group with the rest of the class. She grades on if she likes you or not, not if you know the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	1	Communication		5	3	3	4	959837	5/21/09	She has a passion for PR. Easy. Not clear on assignments but if you go to class and acknowledge her you will do good. She likes feed back especially if you quote something from the book. I read the text book. Very informative but if you go to class and listen its basically the same stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication		4	2	1	3	959837	11/21/08	awful teacher for PR never used the text book and isn't clear with assignments, grades based on if she likes you or not and will disagree with everything you say. Take with a different teacher if you can because she is horrible. final grade won't reflect how you do on graded assignments (most likely lower)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication	109	5	1	1	1	959837	1/30/08	Terrible teacher. Lectures are whatever she feels like that day. Little to no guidance on projects. Do yourself a favor and: DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wilma King	1.9	0	Communication		1	1	1	2	959837	11/1/07	I don't normally put in reviews, but I wanted to warn people about this teacher. Specifically if you aren't in the major described. She believes that everyone in the class is a PR major and believes that they should be able to write award winning material. Furthermore, she can not make up her mind and often grades unfairly. She is unfair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Kiwitt	4.0	2	Film		2	5	4	3	1690205	2/5/13	Peter does not give many A's. However an A is not as important as the life lessons you learn in his class. If you are not in his class for production you need to switch classes because his students are ahead of everyone else. Peter still works in the industry and he has a lot of knowledge about film. He will go out of his way to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Kiwitt	4.0	2	Film		2	4	3	3	1690205	2/3/12	Peter is tough. Especially when it comes to grading and format! He gives lots of work but also a lot of feedback regarding your work. Overall a nice guy who cares about the quality of work you produce.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	2	Accounting	709	4	5	5	4	898341	11/17/11	The lectures were extremely clear and the course structure was the best organized I've ever seen. She is very engaged with her students and will always help clarify. She's capable of inspiring deeper interest and analysis of very boring topics (like taxes). Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	2	Accounting	522	4	5	5	4	898341	11/24/08	Does a good job explaining and simplifying the material in the book. Very friendly and helpful. Work through the homework and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	0	Accounting	340	4	1	2	3	898341	10/13/06	Half the time I tried to ask questions via e-mail I got a terse or even rude response. The class and material itself is okay, except that the projects are just busy work and I don't really get anything out of them so I just feel like I am wasting my time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	1	Accounting		2	3	2	1	898341	2/23/09	She seems like a nice professor. I took her online. Adv Tax is a hard class. Did well on assignments, but horrible on her tests. 2 test = 50% of grade. Test on concepts and taxation is not easy. If you like independent stressful work, take adv tax. Avoid it if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	2	Accounting		4	3	5	5	898341	6/26/07	Great professor. Very easy to understand. Stay on her good side though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roberta Klein	3.2	0	Accounting	522	1	1	1	5	898341	10/9/06	This is the worst prof I have ever had. Does not instruct, Tests you without explaining material. Makes students explain homework problems instead of her. Seems really disinterested if you learn or not. You are on your own. Very confrontational and unhelpful with questions regarding course material. Whines about workload as prof. Emotional
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	5	506908	4/16/11	Excellent teacher - very challenging. He has a lot of knowledge and glad I took the courses he offered. I enjoy the emails and am sorry that they have stopped.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	0	Graphic Arts		4	1	1	1	506908	8/31/05	Without a doubt in the top 3 worst classes and professors Ive had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	1	Graphic Arts		3	4	1	5	506908	1/29/05	tests are INSANE, long, winded lectures, TONS of junkmail, but very approachable. if you have a hard time with him in class, approach him outside and talk to him--he wants students to do well, he's just out of touch with reality.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	2	Graphic Arts		2	4	4	2	506908	9/30/05	Freshman need to quit rating Kleper. This man has shaped and reported more industry knowledge than most will ever understand. Ask him about his research sometime. Kleper isn't an easy-A, but he's among the most interesting people you'll meet in your lifetime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	506908	6/16/05	Terrible. Words can't describe how wretched both the class and teacher were. He cracked his stupid inside printing jokes. Never helped to anyone who struggled. On top of all this he spams people with useless printing news.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kleper	2.5	0	Graphic Arts		3	3	1	1	506908	1/19/05	awful, awful man. boring lectures, trivial tests - sends massive amounts of junk email (im still receiving stuff from him)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Kmiecinski	2.0	0	Hospitality		2	1	3	3	1408555	11/19/10	Online Sports Nutrition class-grading was mostly from weekly discussion (must reply to 8 other students). Is strict grader,grading what you didn't do vs. what you did. Final was online with 62 Q's in an hour. The Q's were too specific, needing exact numbers,and short answers.Barely got to complete the test with a minute left. I don't recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Koch	4.1	2	Business		3	5	4	4	925704	3/3/09	Class requires a lot of time and effort, but is extremely useful and practical. She will go out of her way to help and is very friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Koch	4.1	2	Business		5	4	4	4	925704	3/7/07	Class was easy. Teach your self, quizes once a week online. All true/false or mult choice. Take BSA with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Koch	4.1	2	Business	112	1	4	3	3	925704	2/5/08	She move a every fast and if you are inexperience with excel then you really need to read the chapters. Her homework assignment is really hard and so are her quiz and tests. This is helpful because in order for you to pass this class, you have to know excel inside and out.If you are in a business major you need excel later on so plz take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Koch	4.1	2	Business	270	4	5	4	3	925704	11/29/06	The class is fairly easy. You need to do the HW to get a good grade. There is a quiz every week. The teacher gives you as much help as you need. The powerpoint lectures aren't pleasant but the practical application helps.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Koneski	3.0	1	Mathematics	211	2	3	3	3	1254908	1/19/12	I had her for my freshman Math & Stats Seminar, and in the second quarter of it she assigned us a 5 page paper that we had to use LaTeX for. This was a ONE credit class. She is a very nice person, but she gives unnecessary work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Koneski	3.0	2	Mathematics	225	2	3	4	2	1254908	11/19/09	Super nice teacher,really young.Quizzes every Friday.Homework isn't graded but it's good practice for the exams.Fair grader,especially if she knows you did your best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Koneski	3.0	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	1	1254908	2/14/09	Newer teacher still learning the ropes, and can't handle teaching a lot of information. Isn't very helpful, doesn't do concepts at all, just how to solve a problem. Relies on a terrible textbook. Grades randomly, but will give monster curves. Many extra credit assignments, but sometimes they aren't even worth it. Always happy for some reason.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Koneski	3.0	1	Mathematics	241	1	3	2	2	1254908	10/14/10	Started out okay, but I quickly realized how inexperienced this prof truly is. She relies on an extremely poor (and extremely expensive) textbook. GIANT assignments are given twice a week(I'm currently on my second all nighter just because of this class) and the exercises in the book contain problems that the book itself doesn't even cover. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Koneski	3.0	2	Mathematics	201	2	4	4	4	1254908	10/12/09	Great professor who knows strategies on how to solve and check a problem. Also, very kind. She is hard but it is worth it, I am sure that you will learn a lot in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	K Koppola	2.4	2	Engineering		3	4	4	3	1349813	4/24/11	She has good stuff but her accent is hard to follow. Homeworks are difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	K Koppola	2.4	2	Engineering	344	5	4	4	4	1349813	8/21/10	I had her for Materials Science for the 20094 quarter. I found her class to be fun and enjoyable. She cares about the students, and is willing to aid them outside of class. The work load was low to moderate and not very difficult. I would recommend her if you have the option to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	K Koppola	2.4	0	Engineering	101	1	1	1	1	1349813	12/15/09	Very hard to decipher what she is talking about. In-classes are pretty much done for you so you don't know whats going on. Homeworks are super hard. Expect to spend over 15 hours each week on it. She will be no help at all. Midterms are very hard as well. Final project was the hardest thing Ive ever done. I spent over 25 hours on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	K Koppola	2.4	0	Engineering	342	1	1	1	2	1349813	4/20/11	Never helpful, hard to understand, easy examples in class, difficult homework assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	K Koppola	2.4	1	Engineering		1	2	3	4	1349813	1/25/10	I think she knows her stuff, but often makes errors in her code and doesn't realize it until the whole class is confused. I found several equation errors in the homeworks and the final which make things a lot harder. I understand the other PSWC professor also sucks, but I didn't hear anything about her making blatant errors. I learned a lot.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Karl Korfmacher	5.0	2	Environmental Science	350	4	5	5	3	1500560	3/13/11	Dr. K is fantastic! He'll make you enjoy GIS no matter how much you hate it. He's always willing to help, and he'll make sure you understand concepts. Also, his jokes are actually funny, and the stuff he teaches is pretty useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karl Korfmacher	5.0	2	Environmental Science	450	3	5	5	5	1500560	1/31/11	Karl is the man... He's really helpful and although he's busy, he's always willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shaina Kovalsky	2.0	0	Humanities		3	1	1	1	1634592	11/5/11	Very unprofessional, sarcastic, and awkward at times. Assigns way too much reading of long boring articles. Doesn?t give a clear grade throughout the course, and doesn?t hand back work in a timely manner. Also there is never a clear idea of what each class discussion is about, it always rambles on and turns into randomness for lack of better term.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shaina Kovalsky	2.0	1	Humanities		5	4	2	2	1634592	11/3/11	Boring Professor. She is about 26 and does not seem to be comfortable teaching. Doesn't count attendance or participation and there are no tests or quizzes. Your grade is based off mini response papers that she never reads. We had one 3-5 page paper and a final paper based off the 3-5 page paper. Easiest prof ever but mad boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Kowalczyk	4.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	4	1187406	6/7/10	This class was critical for my major and I learned so much! Weekly assignments took a while, but were worth it. Take good notes, because he talks fast. I wish the raster class was like his.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Kowalczyk	4.8	2	Graphic Arts	216	4	5	4	5	1187406	2/27/09	really cool guy. very willing to help. Very knowledgeable about illustrator. Class got a little boring sometimes, but it was a great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Kozak	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	247880	9/27/11	Best teacher ever! Had him in high school for Calculus and Physics. I miss teachers like this in college!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Kozak	4.7	2	Engineering		5	4	5	5	247880	5/5/05	Dr. K is awesome! Topics are very clear, extremely helpful (sometimes skips office hours, but will stop and help if you find him in a hallway or room), classes contains a chuckle or two to relax the class. Totally recommended!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Kozak	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	247880	9/10/03	He is such an awesome professor! Always take him for thermo and fluids because he'll help you out anytime you can. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable, I learned so much just because he was so concerned about us understanding the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Kozak	4.7	2	Engineering	413	4	5	4	5	247880	11/21/06	Amazing professor! He is everything that a great professor should be. Dont expect the class to be easy though cause its not. I looked forward to going to that class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Kozak	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	247880	8/30/05	Koz-Beast is the man. Super smart, very willing to help. class presentation is funny and enjoyable. had him for thermo, and fluid mechanics

Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology	210	3	4	4	1	63754	8/20/09	I'm bad a multiple choice questions and that's what this class is made of. Luckily extra credit is offered which probably helped me achieve an A. Homework was straight out of the text and easy to get 100% correct. Class consists of 10 weekly homeworks, 3 exams and one research paper. Good class but nothing interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	0	Anthropology		3	2	2	1	63754	11/12/08	She gave us 2 hour powerpoints, which talked about the chapters we already read. Boring lectern.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology	510	2	4	4	3	63754	11/10/07	she was very organized
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		5	5	4	4	63754	6/15/06	She is a very nice lady, very nice, but very boring. Maybe its because research techniques are hard to make interesting, but it was a snoozer. Talked with my partner throughout the quarter and still got an A. Very concerned with students learning. Study the ppts, dont bother reading the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	1	Anthropology		3	3	2	2	63754	10/25/05	Do not take unless you like the material! It will bore you to death otherwise. She loves to hear herself talk and rambles too much on the topics covered in the reading. If you read the book and study guide,and like anthropology you can get an A or a B witout too much trouble.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology	442	5	5	5	3	63754	3/14/11	She was overall quite interesting and experienced in her area of expertise. Sometimes classes could be boring but if you pay attention it's easy to learn. Homework consisted of reading from the textbook and answering 4 multiple choice questions. There were 2 very easy multiple choice exams and 2 essays. Easy and fun teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		3	4	5	5	63754	3/9/09	Been in multiple classes with C Kray. I believe in her cause and love her personality. highly recommended for those looking for a truly intelligent and society-minded prof. If you are just interested in getting an easy A on the other hand then you could give her a shot- you'll probably find the lectures boring if you don't care about the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	5	63754	12/10/07	had prof kray for maybe 3 classes. what a dominator. her voice could put crying children to sleep, so pleasant. lotta kids take the intro to anthro to fill a req lib arts. but she has some fun upper level ones too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	3	63754	10/17/07	Really nice teacher, interesting reads, fun assignments. Definitely would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		5	4	4	4	63754	11/28/05	Very easy class but can be a bit boring. Not hard to get a good grade if u pay attention. I got a B and did a VERY small amount of studying. All the tests were mult. choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		3	4	4	1	63754	5/25/05	Shes a really nice lady... its just that anthropology is boring, and the whole class was power point lectures. I got an A in the class by doing a fair amount of studying. She also gives extra credit oppourtunities as well as bonus on tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		4	3	4	NULL	63754	2/26/04	This teacher isn't too difficult, but her lectures are directly out of the book, making the requred reading assignments totally pointless... loves to hear herself talk. Take her if you need a class to sleep through.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Kray	4.2	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	NULL	63754	12/3/02	super super easy. get A or be ashamed

Rochester Institute of Technology	Heinz Klinkon	4.3	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	NULL	146233	5/15/04	Pauses alot, but its because he actually thinks about everything he says, and its meaningful, metaphoric. GREAT guy! intelligent, patient, opinionated, and open.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		4	4	4	4	348120	3/10/13	Koberlein has a great sense of humor and makes the class fun. He makes use of a lot of examples that reflect his test questions. I would definitely have him again as a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	3	4	2	348120	1/29/13	Good professor. Can be real strict, but pay attention in class and tests are not that hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		4	5	5	4	348120	11/8/12	Absolutely loved his class. I not only understood the material but enjoyed physics as well. He is a funny and nerdy teacher and I always looked forward to his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	348120	9/3/12	Best teacher i have had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	5	5	3	348120	5/21/12	Dr. K is always helpful. He teaches the material in a way that is easy to understand and if you don't understand something, he explains it better. If you put effort in his class you'll get a good grade. My only complaint is that he takes a lot of points off for stupid mistakes on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	5	5	3	348120	3/2/12	Let me tell you he is the best professor in the department. As long as you put forth the effort, you will succeed with him. He tells jokes and makes learning fun! He is also extremely easy on the eyes for any of the few females at RIT who want a nice sight. I would take him again in a heartbeat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		4	5	4	5	348120	5/18/11	Koberlein is the man. Good lectures, very funny if you like nerd humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	2	2	1	348120	1/31/11	I knew I wudnt like him on the first day. seemingly awesome but makes dorky jokes 40% of class. doesn't teach enough. 4 nerds who know physics its a good break, but i hate phys and ACTUALLY needed help instead of hearing his lameass attempts at being cool. If your doing something wrong on a lab he wont tell u. He expects u to b smarter than that
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		4	5	5	5	348120	10/8/10	By far the most fun teacher I've ever had, also very receptive to questions, and unlike many of the other physics teachers here is able to clearly explain things in a practical manner rather than sort of going off on some strange theory that is way above your current education level. I love his class, and suggest taking him if you ever are able.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	4	5	5	348120	2/23/10	As a physics major, I thought Professor Koberlein was a great teacher. His labs are strict, but other than that, he is a fair grader. He tries to emphasize that. He also emphasizes asking questions whenever you are confused and he is very willing to answer them. He goes over problems in great detail. Because of this, you should show up to class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics		3	3	3	2	348120	2/18/13	Would not recommend this professor. I found him amusing the first class as he makes little jokes, but he is not good at explaining things and likes to repeat himself. The worst are his "high-stakes labs" which you fail if you don't calculate something perfectly. Only way to pass is to BS your numbers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	3	4	4	348120	1/22/13	Our physics department is the worst so hes good for the department. Funny at times keeps the class moving, is very good with explaining. Just is an @$$ sometimes and definitely thinks he has more authority and purpose in life than he really does. Just kind of a cold hearted person but at least he can teach
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		2	2	1	5	348120	11/4/12	Terrible professor, will talk down to you if you even show the slightest sign of weakness. He's an astrophysicist, so if you aren't than that sucks for you. Assumes you know things that you obviously don't (because otherwise you wouldn't be taking the class). I got a decent grade, but I feel like I didn't learn anything. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	3	348120	5/27/12	Took him for University Physics 2A, one of the most failed classes at RIT. The material is very hard, but he is completely willing to help you and very good at explaining things or coming up with an example to go through to help you. If you want to pass this class, go ask him for help and it will happen. PS His sense of humor makes physics bearable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	389	4	5	5	3	348120	4/12/12	He is always himself and has a good heart, he is very spontanious and very refreshing. Does not try to trick you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		4	5	5	3	348120	2/17/12	Great teacher who knows his memes. Tells great jokes and keeps the students interested. HE KNOWS HIS STUFF!! Clear when not telling jokes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics		1	2	4	1	348120	4/19/11	Makes jokes that aren't funny half of the class. No personal skills/hard to interact with outside of class. Runs through problems on the board without stopping, so if this isn't your learning style don't take the course. Takes off points for no reason on labs and exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	348120	1/5/11	Prof K keeps the class entertained while doing an excellent job at explaining physics
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics	311	1	2	3	3	348120	6/14/10	One of the better teachers in the physics department. He grades the labs extremely harshly, but his exams are easier than the other professors. He does a lot of examples on the board and make himself clear. He has a wicked weird sense of humor, but if you can get around that, I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	4	3	4	348120	11/24/09	As said, he definitely knows what he's talking about. But, he lets class get off topic too much. Also, he didn't give instruction on how he wanted things done, then took off pts, when it was "wrong."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	311	4	4	5	3	348120	10/23/09	If you pay attention in class, he's a great teacher. His lectures are well organized, and he knows what he's talking about. He's always willing to answer questions in or out of class. Even webassign isn't that bad. I didn't have much prior knowledge coming into the class, but it wasn't that bad. I would definitely recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	559	2	3	5	2	348120	5/4/09	Not sure why everyone else hates him, I've had him for 6 classes and done well in all of them. He teaches clearly if you pay attention and his homeworks and tests are all reasonable. Have taken University phys I, II, and III, Math Physics I, II, and III with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	5	348120	3/11/09	this man should not teach. I worked so hard and did well in highschool phys n still didnt do well. Hes teaching style non exsistant because he doesnt teach. DONT GET HIM OR YOU WILL FAIL
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics	311	2	1	2	2	348120	3/23/08	this guy is an awful professor, he explains things once and expects you to master them and the way he explains them is horrible, i would NOT recommend this professor at all, he is an ass because he specifically stated "i dont care about your grades" meaning he didnt care that he gave half our class D's so we had to take the sequence again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	311	2	4	3	3	348120	2/4/08	Labs are quite a bit of work and there is one per week. Good at explaining and showing how the material works. Tests are quite challenging. Jokes a bit too much in class, but good at getting work done. Hope that your class isn't full of jerks who try to talk over him. If you put in the work you will enjoy his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	348120	11/9/07	HORRIBLE professor, probably the rudest person I've come across in life. He seems cool at first, but turns nasty when you need help. Doesn't care how much effort you put into course and only thinks you should worry about his. If you get him, drop it or switch out ASAP. Save yourself before its too late!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	348120	3/6/06	the worst 10 weeks i ever had. yea he was funny but his teaching was all over the place and hard to follow i learned more doing the webassign then sitting in his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	348120	10/20/05	A very animated and fun/funny professor. He grades hard on tests, but curves. He is very fair, and if you do your work he will give you good grades. I liked him so much I took a second class with him. He knows the material and conveys it to you effectivly. Also if you need help he is willing to give it to you. Also flexable with due dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	313	2	4	4	3	348120	9/22/05	Funny as all hell. Definitely had a blast in his class. Tough but fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	4	5	3	348120	5/7/09	Great teacher- all these low raters are sensitive idiots. Very clear way of presenting things, willing to repeat himself if you ask a question, never made fun of anyone for it. Exam questions are all taken from example problems he gives in class. It does get a little boring, but try not to zone out or you'll miss things. Would def take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		1	3	5	4	348120	4/29/09	He's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. He is pretty awkward but thats expected especially at RIT. Scared the crap out of me the first day of class when he gave his whole "50% of you will fail" speech, but all in all very good at explaining things. Tough teacher, but super smart you could ask him about anything and he'll explain it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics	311	1	1	1	3	348120	5/18/08	The worst teacher I have ever had. His jokes are annoying and only funny to nerds. I even heard he once called a student a nooblar b/c he didn?t know what species chubaka was. His office hours are meant to make you feel awkward and hurry you away, so that he can get back to those action figures lined up and ready for battle. Do not take class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics	311	3	4	3	4	348120	2/18/08	He is a very smart guy. But is fairly difficult to learn from. It's important to ask questions in class if you are lost. Will try to help you out. If you still don't get it ask him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics	311	1	2	3	4	348120	1/28/08	Tests are short and he is a strict grader, seems to be strict,but fair. Makes class interesting, reminds people of Robin Williams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics	210	1	1	1	4	348120	9/26/07	This guy is not only the worst teacher I have ever had, he is an extremely rude person. He seems very carless towards his students learning, and when you ask him a question, he just replies like you're an idiot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	4	4	5	348120	5/12/06	Not the easiest class in the world. A very smart proffesor who will help if you need it. Go to all the classes and go to all the labs and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	348120	11/20/05	This guy is the worst Physics teacher ive ever had. He might seem funny and down to earth at first but underneath he is a sadistic person. He enjoys giving low grades and doesnt care about his students. He laughs at you when you do poorly on his tests and makes fun of you in class. His tests are extremely hard plus he is a hard grader. BAD TEACHER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	4	5	5	348120	10/19/05	Very funny man, and as long as you don't interrupt him frequently while he's teaching, it will be a fun class. Tests are fairly tough, but once you have taken one, you will know his tricks and style, and the rest become easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		3	4	5	3	348120	6/20/05	I agree Dr. K is a tough grader but, if you read his syllabus it says exactly how he wants lab writups done. Tells you exactly what to expect on tests and gives a few(easy) pop quizzes. If you're a fan of monty python or anything nerdy like 8-bit theater you'll love this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	348120	6/16/05	Hard grader. Boring as all hell. Misleading. he won't let you know you are failing until the last moment. Not a good person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	0	Physics		3	2	2	NULL	348120	5/21/04	I hate this guy.. Hard grader. Doesn't even say why he takes off points. Hard to learn that way..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics		3	3	3	NULL	348120	3/8/04	My Grade: D. Dr. Koberlein was a decent teacher. He was flexible with due dates, but a stickler for a grader. Humorous at times, he did try to make class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	2	Physics		2	4	4	5	348120	5/1/05	Dr. K was awesome. If you know anything about nerdy pop culture, he'll make you laugh alot. He is a strict grader, but if you pay attention then you'll know the material well enough to get at least a B. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Koberlein	3.3	1	Physics		2	3	3	NULL	348120	5/19/04	strict grader, funny at times
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kolodziej	5.0	2	Engineering	543	4	5	5	4	1410453	11/23/11	Great teacher with a great personality. Very down to earth.He's been in the field so he knows whats important. Quizzes and tests were challenging, but definitely covered what was expected. Extremely fair grader, if you got the general concept you do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kolodziej	5.0	2	Engineering		2	5	5	4	1410453	11/11/10	Very good prof. Explains well, many examples, makes sure you know it, extra review sessions. Easy quizzes, wants you to do well, grades fairly. Tests are hard but only because of common core multiple choice section. Must take him if you can. Also, good time slot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kolodziej	5.0	2	Engineering	347	5	5	5	5	1410453	3/23/11	Great teacher. Does a good job of balance between theory and example problem. Example problems are relevant and really help understand the material. Gives weekly quizzes and does a great job answering questions. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kolodziej	5.0	2	Engineering	336	4	5	5	4	1410453	5/20/10	Very clear, focuses heavily on example problems but explains the theory behind each step instead of just working through them. Hosted review sessions for all sections before exams. Usually announces quizzes unless half the class skips, not too strict about attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shawn  Koppe	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1758772	3/4/13	Very nice and easy. Lets you know exactly what you need to do to get an A. Does not expect you to do very many hours of service work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shawn  Koppe	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1758772	10/29/12	She knows that Freshman aren't particularly interested in Discovery and tries not to make it boring. She wants you to do well and just get an A and is very nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shawn  Koppe	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	1758772	11/14/12	VERY EASY. Do the work, each assignments don't take a lot of time (maybe 5 min max!). Laid back, easy going teacher! Easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karuna Koppula	4.2	1	Engineering		4	4	2	3	1656831	3/5/13	Her teaching is a little scattered, but as long as you do the homework and understand that you should get an A. Very beneficial to go to her office hours. Tests are exact homework questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karuna Koppula	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1656831	2/8/12	Taught in a way so that we will remember the equations long after use and I prefer this method since we are engineers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karuna Koppula	4.2	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1656831	9/30/12	extremely useful class,crystal clear topics,helps to gain lot of knowledge
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kotlarchyk	4.6	2	Science		2	5	5	5	66041	4/9/13	The class (Modern Physics I) was really difficult, but he is an awesome teacher. He explained concepts really well and was super helpful. He knows what he's talking about and is good at explaining it to students. Grading is tough but fair. If you don't know the stuff, you will not do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kotlarchyk	4.6	2	Science		3	5	5	5	66041	2/24/06	Very good professor. Explains the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics well. Tests can be a little difficult, but usually covers an example that was covered in class so there are no real surprises.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Kotlarchyk	4.6	2	Science		2	5	5	5	66041	4/28/05	Great Guy, Very smart. Challenging but will make you learn A LOT!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	2	264425	9/30/05	Prof. Kovanis is a great professor, if tough. Very willing to help, very thurough, very intelligent. He is a bit tough and will push you, but that is why you came to college. I hope. If you do all the work, you will do very well. I handed the final (one of the hardest I've had) to him and said with a giant grin "Is that all you have?" =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	NULL	264425	8/23/04	I thought he was great. He was kind of funny. His tests and homeworks were pretty hard, but if you have done all he has asked, you'll do well. I've tried to get him for calc 3, 4 but it just doesn't seem to line up with everything else I have to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	0	Mathematics	123	1	1	1	NULL	264425	5/6/04	"You are masters of calculus" is his claim ... you will not be a master of calculus after completing his class period. Very hard to understand and follow during lectures. No calculators allowed.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	264425	11/29/04	He is very insightful. He is not a normal teacher and rarely if ever uses the book. He is concerned more with what you will take away from the class rather than memorizing useless information. if you pay attention and write notes, it won't be hard. He hooks it up with extra credit if needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	NULL	264425	5/19/04	very funny, and helpful if you are serious about the course. does not like when you sleep in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	264425	3/7/04	quite possibly the worst calc teacher at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vassilios Kovanis	2.9	2	Mathematics	251	2	5	4	NULL	264425	11/16/03	What is the fundamental question?

Rochester Institute of Technology	Piotr Kowalski	4.0	2	Chemistry	215	1	4	4	2	1739068	12/11/12	Nice and helpful, but extremely harsh grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Kramer	3.0	1	Writing		5	3	3	1	1053652	11/12/07	Writing Seminar was a easy class. Kramer will give you a ton of handouts and have trouble teaching some of the classes. He tends to studder and sweat a lot, nice guy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kremens	5.0	2	Science	234	5	5	5	3	1629334	2/16/13	Took Oceanus (online). Super, super easy. Take it if you just need a free credit. Lets you take the quizzes twice and the 2nd time around the answers are given. Interesting material as well. Gives 2 weeks to post discussions or do quizzes. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kremens	5.0	2	Science		4	5	5	5	1629334	2/16/12	More researcher than professor. Every lecture conveys his passion for the subject, and his deep understanding. He engenders a child-like curiosity in students, and you can't help but dive in and learn all you can. Great attitude, and very helpful in and outside of class. Explains things better than anyone, and shows you the big picture. F
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kremens	5.0	2	Science		5	5	5	5	1629334	3/1/12	Love Oceanus. Such a layed back class and you learn alot about the Ocean and Environment. Great replied to discussions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Kruger	5.0	2	Music	101	5	5	5	5	1460964	11/21/11	He is the man. Very relaxed. Tests are on lectures but he goes over exactly what's on the test beforehand. Need a laptop for the tests. Uses youtube and other videos instead of a book. Knows a lot and has real life experience with what he's teaching. Take if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Kruger	5.0	2	Music		4	5	5	2	1460964	7/15/10	Interesting lectures. Tests are all online and get easier as the class goes on. Final is just a bunch of questions from old quizzes so look up those questions and answers for the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	4	5	5	5	1482001	11/10/12	Super chill! Easily the best professor I've had so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	4	5	5	5	1482001	9/14/12	Professor Krutz is the best teacher I have ever had. He is very intelligent and approachable, yet while being humble.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	5	5	5	5	1482001	9/14/12	Awesome professor. Really tries hard to make teams be the best they can be. Get him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	4	1482001	5/22/12	Great professor, he really revitalized my interest in Software Engineering and the class never really had a dull point. All the activities were very hands on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	4	1482001	11/12/11	Awesome professor. Keeps the class interesting. Take his class if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	452	4	5	5	3	1482001	2/25/11	I don't know what it is about him, maybe because he seems so young, but he comes off as one of us. Not the strict, intimidating, "I control your grade" type professors. His lectures are easy going and entertaining - really knows his stuff. One of my favorite professors I've had in a long time. I never talk in class, but for his I always spoke up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	5	5	5	5	1482001	10/25/12	He is amazing professor, really chill and awesome. take him for any class and you will love it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	5	5	5	5	1482001	9/14/12	He is an awesome professor. Had him for intro to SE and 361 class and it was just an awesome experience. Really humble and understanding person. HIGHLY RECOMENDED
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	361	5	5	5	5	1482001	9/14/12	I love Krutz! He's a fantastic professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	1482001	1/30/12	Really helpful, and really knows his stuff. Presented the information clearly, one of my favorite professors!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	452	4	5	5	3	1482001	5/12/11	Pretty awesome professor. Take him whenever you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Krutz	4.9	2	Computer Science	452	4	4	4	4	1482001	2/16/11	Professor Krutz has a laid back type of attitude and is pretty lenient in grading. His lectures cover some important topics so it's good to stay awake. If you're interested in software testing I recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhireesha Kudithipudi	3.4	2	Engineering	351	2	5	4	4	958950	3/1/09	Excellent professor. She's very knowledgeable and is good at explaining things. She's also very nice and EXTREMELY helpful during office hours. It was a pleasure to take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhireesha Kudithipudi	3.4	2	Engineering	730	3	5	4	4	958950	6/10/08	Very helpful and friendly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhireesha Kudithipudi	3.4	2	Engineering		2	5	5	4	958950	11/21/07	New professor, but spends enormous time with students to make sure they understand. She is my favorite
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhireesha Kudithipudi	3.4	1	Engineering		4	4	2	4	958950	8/28/08	She makes a lot of mistakes on the board, so if you are the nerd in the class, please do catch her. If the class feels strongly about something, like giving extra credit on a test, she tends to give in pretty easily. She usually tells you what to expect on her quizzes/tests so be sure to study some. Also, shes a smokin' hot teacher to boot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhireesha Kudithipudi	3.4	1	Engineering		1	2	3	4	958950	3/9/08	new professor, mostly you teach yourself, not terribly difficult tests, but plan on spending 10-20 hours a week on each lab, as a lot of it isn't covered in class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Kuhl	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	651770	8/15/05	I took both his basic and advanced simulation class which inspired my total interest in simulation. I like him very much as a nice professor. 5 star recommand!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Kuhl	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	651770	8/12/05	I took this class as an undergrad in another major and he was very very helpful. He made the class fun and gave very relevant examples. He's a wonderful professor. Too bad I can't take him again. Kuhl is cool :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	3	67406	3/5/13	Kumar is a good guy but at times is unclear. The class wasn't too bad and weekly quizes were predictable. Heavy on proofs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	2	67406	2/15/13	He's actually not a bad guy. He is very tough, kind of expects perfection. If you have a class with him and are struggling, just show some initiative and see him during office hours...he's very willing to help in any way. He will come across somewhat condescending, just get over it and you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics	282	2	4	3	4	67406	1/3/11	A very smart professor compared to many of the others who can barely perform basic algebraic computations... Not the easiest class. If you do the work and show your work, then you'll do fine. Nice guy too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics	319	3	2	2	2	67406	8/8/10	His teaching style was confusing and disorganized. He also made 90% of our grade based on tests. It definitely takes a lot of teaching yourself to pass this class with this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics	351	2	2	2	1	67406	3/7/10	A really stern taskmaster type who treats college students like unruly kids; hard to follow, and overly harsh in grading (all your work must be shown, and match what he was expecting to the letter).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics	314	1	5	4	1	67406	4/14/08	Crazy hard grader. I got a 60% on a quiz even though I had the right answers but I didn't have the variables clearly defined at the top. Explains things well but talks very quiet. If he sees you use your computer too much he will tell you to put it away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics	314	2	2	2	1	67406	10/16/07	This guy will treat you like you're in 6th grade. He stops talking if others are talking and demands that you ask him questions and not others. I'm just surprised that he doesn't make us put our heads down and turn off the lights until the class is quiet. He is a very harsh grader and will not compromise his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	3	67406	5/15/07	This guy is terrible... first he talks so quiet and has a rough accent, it becomes difficult to understand. Secondly he rushes through all of his problems, never stops to make you get the material. Lastly, his tests are very hard, prepare to teach yourself and work a long time on the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics	231	4	4	5	2	67406	3/2/07	Straightforward, clear in class and a consistent grader. If you're good to him he'll be good to you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	4	67406	1/30/07	He is a good teacher, but is horrible if you go to his office hours. He'll only confuse you more if you do so! Accent is barable and is a good guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		1	3	5	3	67406	2/17/13	Lectures and explains things well, is a pretty nice guy and willing to help students. But grades extremely harshly, gives only an hour for exams (lectures the first hour), doesn't explain points taken off well, and requires full explanations in sentences alongside a correct answer for full points. TL;DR: Don't take him if you can avoid it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67406	5/23/12	He was rude throughout the course and generally un helpful. Would not suggest taking a class with this teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	5	67406	10/24/10	he's ok..i got an A for this course..if u follow what he wanted, then u'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	2	67406	7/23/10	He's not as bad as everyone says. When you have a question he answers it very clearly, and is typically very specific. He teaches a lot better than the other Data1 professor from what I've seen. Quizs are easy if you pay attention in class, and the tests aren't extremely hard if you've studied for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	3	3	67406	10/26/09	a.he treats you like elemantary school kids. makes me & my friend sit in the front. b. he takes off the dumbest points on exams. you get the answers right + show your work but hell still find a way - and rarely any partial credit. i dont find the material difficult but this guy is crazy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67406	3/2/08	This guy is terrible, he is very hard to follow and he moves so quickly your lost from the start. His tests are insane, you have to know how to solve some of the hardest equations with barely any practice. The homework is long and difficult, he grades harsh and is not helpful at all, so expect to learn on your own and read thoroughly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67406	6/22/07	Had for matrix algebra. i read these possts before taking his class and I AM TELLING YOU DO NOT TAKE IT. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT. i didnt believe them, but BELIEVE THEM. IF NO ONE REGISTERS WE CAN GET THIS **** GONE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67406	5/14/07	he is a very good professor, very helpful, usually goes out of way to help you. An easy A if you can understand him and do exactly what he asks you to do
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	2	67406	2/7/07	Awful teacher, he runs through problems way too quickly and looks at you dumbfounded if you do not understand. His homework and tests are graded very harshly. He provided a re-take since our whole class pretty much failed, but there was barely an improvement. Stay far away, you'd be teaching yourself everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	4	67406	12/4/06	TERRIBLE teacher and very arrogant! He has a bad teaching style that is hard to learn from. Taking him as a professor will be like having the responsibility to teach yourself!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	4	67406	9/11/06	He has a strange teaching style that I and many others found difficult to learn from. You have to do a lot of outside studying and work in order to understand what's going on. Wouldnt recomend him 2 anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67406	10/25/05	Terrible teacher. Hard to understand sometimes because of his accent. Does not grade homework and if you want to know anything he tells you to see him during office hours. A rock as a teacher could have made the class more exciting. Definately do not recommend taking this class with him. Not very hard material but he will do his best to make it hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	5	67406	1/25/05	Wow this guy is bad. He is arrogant and his teaching style is terrible. If you take his class, expect to work your butt off just to get a C. Do yourself a favor, find another section, or take the class another quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	67406	11/2/04	I think he was a very good professor. He was one of the better Calc teacher I've ever had. Classmates think he's unclear, but I seem to understand him. He's really a nice guy and I think he's easy to understand, it's the content that's difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	NULL	67406	5/18/04	Tough to Follow, made the course harder. Shot you down when asking questions. Not a teacher i would reccommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67406	5/26/03	Very organised. Gives handouts to summarize what will be taught. Very clear. Doesn't grade HW's but if you don't miss any classes easy to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	67406	6/8/06	started the course out badly and ended up with a B. sure he has an accent, but not a heavy accent. he means what he says.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	3	67406	5/2/05	Great professor. Started out badly but ended up getting a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67406	11/17/04	He doesnt explain clearly, grades tests based on answers not work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	67406	9/13/04	I re took this class because he's an **** and got an A with Prof. YOung.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	1	Mathematics		1	4	2	NULL	67406	4/15/04	Nice Guy.. would not take him as a professor again. Bounces around in notes, not clear. Need to do alot of outside work!!! Tough class that was made more difficult because of his teaching ways!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Seshavadhani Kumar	2.8	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	NULL	67406	1/25/03	Slightly anal on tests, however if you do the work; shouldn't be too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Abby Kuperstock	5.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	1702142	3/22/12	Abby was a great teacher. The class requirements were a little tedious but were relevant to the Illustration industry. After the first project you can choose your medium.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	5	1021007	10/29/12	I would not suggest taking him,if at all possible. He simply can't teach! All lectures consist of him reading out of the book, with everyone starring at him with clueless looks on their faces. He refuses to clarify points. Honestly we arent sure if he can actually code (everything is stolen out of the authors text). He fails to give any examples
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	1	Information Technology		1	3	3	3	1021007	5/22/12	Kurtz is a good teacher for self-starters. If you're willing to learn the material on your own, Kurtz will only show you a couple things you need to know throughout the quarter. You should also expect to be forced into working mostly on his class for the quarter, and not on anything else. He also tends to repeat himself a lot if you look for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	5	1021007	5/13/12	Kurtz is a great teacher. When the class didn't understand a section he changed how he explained the topic until the majority of the class understood. His explanations were great. The course work is challenging, but it really helps with your understanding of the topics covered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	4	1021007	1/22/11	Very good professor. Helpful in and out of class. Fair in grading. He knows the material he is teaching. I am taking him for DSA1, which is a very hard class where the homework load is extremely heavy. I am glad to have the intelligent and comprehensible professor that Kurtz is for this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	5	1021007	2/3/09	Kurtz is the man. I got placed into Programming I for New Media a week into the quarter (with NO programming experience) and he helped me catch up as much as he could. Legitimately cares about his students understanding material. You will miss a lot if you skip class and do not know Flash programmin
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	0	Information Technology		5	1	1	2	1021007	8/23/07	Incomprehensible. Learned a little at first and then during the second quarter its like he just lost all teaching ability. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	0	Information Technology		1	3	1	4	1021007	5/23/12	He teaches only from the textbook. Expects you to code complex 3d concepts without giving any examples. Lectures consist of him simply reading the text out. The only positive is that he will attempt to help if you seek it outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	5	1021007	5/20/12	One of the worst I've ever had. He teaches only from the textbook, which is full of errors, and dated. He attempts to do problems on the board, does them incorrect, then has to refer back to the text for the answer. Constant memorization of formulas instead of spending time TEACHING!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	1021007	4/13/11	The best Data Structures & Algorithms professor. His course is very well organized, complete with online quizzes, labs, and homeworks. You end up learning a lot about computational physics. He is also helpful outside of class if too much goes over your head.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	4	1021007	9/5/10	Had him for data structures and analysis. Was great with examples and basic for first 3 weeks. Got ridiculously hard but could be just the class suffering for too much information for 10 weeks. Midterm and final were memorization with everybody failing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Kurtz	3.2	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	1021007	2/1/09	BEST teacher i've had at RIT so far. his method of teaching was very comprehensible. i learned everything almost with no effort. he also seems like he actually cares if you learn or not. if you can, definitely take him he is awesome! he made programming fun! i switched to gordon goodman and now i want to shoot myself!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Kwasinski	3.6	2	Engineering	694	4	5	4	4	1487906	2/25/13	Very fair, clear, and kind professor who makes materials available online and gives few assignments with plenty of resources. Kwasinski is one of the best in the department!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Kwasinski	3.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1487906	2/29/12	Really good professor. Smart, helpful. One foe the best I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Kwasinski	3.6	1	Engineering		5	3	3	4	1487906	1/16/13	I had him for intro CE - he was hard to understand and the class was boring. But his Data Comm class is the easiest class at RIT. Tests are open-laptop, with access to all of his lecture notes. If you can read, you can pass. It doesn't matter that you can't understand him and his voice puts you to sleep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andres Kwasinski	3.6	0	Engineering		5	2	2	4	1487906	4/24/11	Hard to understand, unorganized and not helpful. This introduction class to Computer Engineering is one of the reasons so many people drop out of EECC in the first quarter. I think he knows what he is talking about but has no way to convey it. Avoid his class, you won't learn anything and all the fun will be taken out of this field for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	91271	11/17/11	She is an amazing teacher very helpful. on quizzes you can use your homework and on tests you can use all notes. she explains things very well and clear and is always offering help. she is funny and keeps the class interesting had her for college math failed most of highschool math classes passed her class with an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	272	4	5	4	4	91271	4/21/11	Great professor. She's helpful, caring, and she know's her stuff and how to convey it. I wish all calc teachers were as good as her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	272	4	4	5	3	91271	5/19/10	This class would have been impossible if Labachova wasn't such a great teacher. I refuse to take math with anyone else. Her notes are always available and assignments are very clear. She answers any and all questions, and will make sure you understand. She's also beautiful, with a nice accent, so I can't complain about the attendance policy <3
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	262	5	4	3	3	91271	2/17/10	Labachova is awesome. She puts notes up online and goes through everything when she's doing problems so that you don't miss anything. She projects her tablet PC, so it's really easy to see what's going on. She also puts these notes up online and just a really nice person. I definitely recommend her. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	261	2	5	2	1	91271	11/18/09	One of the better Math teachers that I've had, once I got used to the way she speaks. She's very helpful when you need help or don't understand something. Be sure to show up to her class as if you're absent more than 2 times you can only get a max grade of a C. She doesn't check homework but it helps the material. Gives 3 medium difficulty tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	2	2	91271	10/27/09	Very helpful teacher, it can be hard to understand her at times, but you get by that. Very conscience of how student are doing in her class, always available for help. She enjoys what she teaches and knows how to teach it. Tests can be a little difficult, but as long as you study, you should be fine. I recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	1	91271	3/12/09	Probably the best math professor at RIT. Very effective at getting the concepts across; she gives a lot of in-class work, but it's well-structured and engaging, and she's very good at one-on-one help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	226	3	5	4	2	91271	2/4/09	Awesome Professor!! Always willing to meet with you if you need extra help. Her explanations were very clear.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	274	3	5	4	2	91271	8/8/07	Great professor, one of the math departments best. She really seems to care about her students and tries to get everyone to understand. Is very willing and able to help outside of class. Besides the test being very complete and sometimes long the 4 sequence Calc sections were very fair and somewhat fun to take, but it helps that she is hot too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	203	3	5	5	4	91271	5/1/07	Great professor, had her for Discrete Math I+II. Helpful, clear, and points for showing up! Take her by all means.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	5	3	91271	12/6/06	Discrete Math I. Very good teacher, explains concepts well. Great office hours, always around to help. Weekly quizzes and tests are very fair. No trick questions, but you better know your material well, a lot can appear on the test. Study well or you just won't have the time to finish. As long as you don't blow it off, you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	5	91271	11/1/06	Very helpful. I have never had a better teacher! She explains concepts in detail, and answers questions thoughtfully. She makes sure that everyone understands the material, and grades fairly. If you get an answer wrong because of an improper sign of simple mistake, she does not deduct full credit. Great professor, highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics	271	5	5	4	4	91271	9/20/06	Very nice teacher, sounds like a Russian accent. Easy tests, easy to follow lectures. That's about it. Not bad to look at either
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	91271	5/4/06	Pay attention and you'll do well. Very easy class. Half of quizzes/tests come from Homework. So do HW to get an 'A' or 'B'. She looks and is a very nice teacher. Helps as much as she can. Accent does not get in way of understanding. Eye candy. Highly Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	91271	12/21/05	As long as you can get past her accent you should do fine in the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	91271	1/11/05	Very helpful to the students. Likes to see them succeed. And some very serious eye candy... :P
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	3	91271	11/9/04	you may think you are smarter then her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	NULL	91271	5/21/04	Labachova is awesome. Yes. She has an accent, but who cares? She is still easy to understand. She makes sure everyone really understands what she is doing before she goes on to a new topic. She's a great teacher and she's slammin'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	NULL	91271	5/7/04	She is a very nice lady and a great teacher. Explains the material well and gives the right amount of homework. Has an accent but I had no trouble understanding her. However, her tests can be extremely difficult, but she does curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	NULL	91271	7/13/03	She is very friendly and always willing to help her students whenever she can. Although the material would be hard, she would make it easier and she strives to help her students be successful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	1	91271	2/1/05	She is hot, thats it. Avoid this class unless you want to teach yourself discrete math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Iryna Labachova	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	3	91271	11/29/04	desent teacher. gives lots of examples, makes sure you understand before moving on.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kraynik	4.8	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	745153	11/11/10	Awesome class. Explained machining processes well. Very fun class if you like machining. Take if you get the chance. Good for experience on resumes and co-ops.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kraynik	4.8	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	745153	1/19/07	I enjoyed this class, I wish he taught all of my engineering classes. Very kind, good sense of humor. Wonderful sense of humor, easy to get along with. Also he's willing to take you step by step through your project, and makes sure you know what you're doing. Most awesome dude ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kraynik	4.8	2	Engineering		5	4	5	4	745153	5/17/09	Had him for intermediate machining. He was really helpful and wanted students to become familiar with the machines. He has a lot of experience and can give you advice on almost any process. Course is new, so it was a little disorganized, but it's definitely a good idea to take it if you're in MechE. I wish RIT offered another machining course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kraynik	4.8	2	Engineering		5	5	4	5	745153	11/2/05	Awesome class. Easy A. Kraynik is extremely helpful and wants the kids to do well. Grading is very easy and at the end of the class, you get to keep the hammer you make. I was completely new to the machines when I started taking the class, but after some demonstrations and questions, I never had problems. My hammer came out great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	0	Electrical Engineering	213	1	1	1	4	809417	3/4/12	He is the type of professor who is just gonna set there and read his slides. Won't put the effort to explain anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	1	Electrical Engineering	101	2	3	2	4	809417	10/24/10	Not a very good professor, makes simple concepts more difficult than they need to be, often grades what he feels like not what the questions ask. Stickler about neatness and grades homework with a fine tooth comb. Dont take him if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	0	Electrical Engineering	202	1	3	1	3	809417	1/21/09	Really tough Grader. Teaching style is awful. Gives material he never went over. if you are better reading a book your okay. but if you dont like reading the book stay away. if you value your sanity say away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	0	Electrical Engineering	337	1	1	2	3	809417	4/16/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	0	Electrical Engineering		1	2	2	3	809417	2/10/12	A very hard grader.He drills you with questions that are not on the test and his grading is inconsistent. He grades depending on his mood, he made that clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	2	Electrical Engineering		2	4	3	3	809417	3/2/09	Tests are from notes and grading is fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	2	Electrical Engineering		2	5	4	3	809417	5/1/07	Very fair with quizes but his tests are very hard. Show up to class and his office hours otherwise he will be very hard on you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dave Krispinski	2.4	1	Electrical Engineering		2	2	3	2	809417	2/9/06	Tough grader. Not much partial credit on exams. Class is easy to follow, and he will stop for questions. Only has office hour for 30 minutes a day, and is rarely able to help in that time frame.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristi Krumrine	4.0	2	Anthropology		4	4	4	3	1497692	10/25/11	Cultural Anthropology for one of my liberal arts classes. It's an interesting subject but class can be boring. She talks and you listen. She likes to show videos about cultural stuff. Lots of reading! Exams should be fairly simple if you read the readings. Not that many assignments. There is a final project. Slightly easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1392842	2/10/13	One of the best teachers I've had in a while. He works with the people who struggle with the material and is really approachable. Quizzes are from the homeworks he assigns and he lets you use index cards for exams. If you have to take Data analysis 1, I highly recommend getting into his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	1392842	4/19/11	I absolutely despise math and haven't taken a math class in years. Kuby really cares that his students learn and do well, but he is not lenient with grades! You really have to do work. Most homework is not graded/checked, but it's used for quizzes and helps you learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1392842	5/20/10	Awesome guy and a great teacher. He makes Data Analysis I fun - I really wish he taught Data II as well, but his wife "would leave him if he taught another class" (haha) -- highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	3	1392842	1/11/10	Bomb teacher, young and cool. Can teach the subjects he has and knows the material well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1392842	11/12/11	Great teacher, very easy to understand and always was willing to give an extra hand to those who needed it. I highly recommend this teacher if your math skills are rusty because he can help you big time!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	3	1392842	10/26/10	best teacher ever! teaches very clearly and really helps you understand it. also, very cool guy and kept class entertaining.exams are very fair if you study..he pretty much tells you exactly whats on them. oh and do the hw..those ques are on exams. would defiently buy this guy a beer if i had the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Kuby	4.9	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	3	1392842	3/9/10	Awesome professor. Great teacher and really cool guy. Do the homework and study for exams and you'll do great!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kuehl	3.2	1	Engineering	555	4	3	3	3	1565697	5/22/11	The professor seems to grade quizzes more leniently than the exams and projects. There's lots of busy work to be done, but the class is relatively easy. On a 5 point rating I would give him a 3/5.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Kuehl	3.2	2	Engineering	555	3	3	4	3	1565697	4/19/11	This professor is a hard one to figure out. At times he seems to know what he's talking about and other times he doesn't. There's lots of busy work and his grading seems inconsistent, sometimes they're lenient and sometimes they're not. Overall he's an OK professor, not sure if I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Narayan Kulkarni	1.5	0	Computer Science	420	1	1	1	1	981055	3/1/11	Worst professor at RIT 1)All his exam qs were from a book that he asked us NOT to buy 2) Didn't show up for any online meetings even after scheduling time 3) Grading is unfair and inconsistent 4) Rarely replies any emails 5) One time he forgot to post quiz until last minute 6) Most of his feedbacks for exams were completely wrong. 7) His slides are full of mistakes and are confusing. Don't take him at all - complete waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Narayan Kulkarni	1.5	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	1	981055	5/7/09	He's a terrible teacher. H isn't really helpful and his notes are useless. The code samples he gives to help are wrong. He's disorganized, and slow to do updates. I completed our last project early, then he updated the server so it no longer worked. It's an online class, so not too bad, but he is still AWFUL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Narayan Kulkarni	1.5	1	Computer Science		2	3	3	4	981055	4/23/07	Moves extremely fast, especially over the material that he will test you on. The book is not as useful as the notes so make sure you go over the notes carefully. Projects are fairly easy and fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Narayan Kulkarni	1.5	0	Computer Science	420	1	1	1	2	981055	11/18/10	Awful teacher. Took Data Comm online with him. Lecture notes and quiz/exam questions littered with spelling errors and poor grammar. Ambiguously worded questions requiring exact answers make it almost impossible to do well on exams. Programming assignments were also a joke. Avoid at all costs, even if it requires changing your major.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Narayan Kulkarni	1.5	0	Computer Science	420	1	1	2	4	981055	11/16/08	This teacher is terrible. Do not take him. Save yourself. His tests are completely out of nowhere in terms of the material he tests with. It was an extremely stressful class, though his projects were easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Kunsman	4.2	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	903159	5/9/10	Eric has been one of the best professors I've had at RIT. He has been very helpful with both b&w and color related questions. He makes clear presentations and wants his students to learn. He is enthusiastic and a pleasure to talk to. Eric clearly cares about his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Kunsman	4.2	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	903159	10/22/06	Eric is a pretty good teacher and easy to get along with.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Kunsman	4.2	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	903159	7/29/08	We actually learned how to make our images look like exhibition prints. I thought the class would be all Photoshop and printing but there was more critique about prints then anything else. It really helped me to improve my Photoshop skills but more importantly it helped with starting to create a personal vision.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Santosh Kurinec	3.5	2	Engineering		2	4	3	4	409963	3/7/13	I had her for my semiconductor devices II and am now taking EM Fields with her. She is disorganized and expects you to be able to solve complex math problems which do not increase your knowledge of the topic. There were 8 people in the class originally, but 4 of them dropped. Out of those that stayed, there was one A, two Bs, and a C. Hard Class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Santosh Kurinec	3.5	2	Engineering	456	3	5	5	3	409963	7/29/09	very bright and well connected to the profession and topic
Rochester Institute of Technology	Santosh Kurinec	3.5	0	Engineering		4	1	3	NULL	409963	5/16/04	very disorganized, and ddifficult to work with
Rochester Institute of Technology	Santosh Kurinec	3.5	0	Engineering	515	1	2	2	1	409963	5/1/11	I have no idea how she became a professor. She is useless and not helpful.Her tests are difficult and she is a tough grader. Before my final, the class had about 50 percent average and only one person was going to pass the class.The only part about the class I enjoyed was when she had go to a conference and Dr.Jackson taught the class. Avoid her!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexandra Kuzmich	4.8	2	Languages	101	3	5	4	5	1492470	11/6/10	A great language teacher! Cares and wants to make sure you get the material. Mixes french w/ english so you can grasp the content more. Also, she stresses the importance of studying the book by asking questions in class. Easy grade if your interested in the language, TAKE HER CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexandra Kuzmich	4.8	2	Languages	440	4	5	5	4	1492470	11/25/10	Great professor. Very helpful. Lots of online homework, but it's bearable. Very generous grading. Would definitely take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science	703	5	5	5	4	475679	11/2/11	Amazing professor. Tend to always walk away from his class smiling
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	475679	8/20/08	Like most everybody else said, professor Kwon shows exceptional interest in the class and in how well his students are doing. Work load was rather heavy (data comm II) but you learn the material extremely well! For sure my favorite professor at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	475679	11/17/06	Very nice person, very eager to help, I don't see any problem from his accents, maybe he has improved his accent problem during the years? He is a very very nice person again, and very engaged in class and outside of the class as well, I had him for data comm network 2 and I thought all the projects and homework were very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	1	Computer Science		2	3	2	5	475679	11/28/05	He's a very nice guy, although he doesn't make the concepts very clear. Not too tough of a grader either. He will gladly help you if you need it. If you don't have much programming experience I suggest not taking his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	475679	3/6/05	I don't know why people complain about accents. I imagine if you went to a foreign country and spoke a different language, you would have an accent too. Kwon is very helpful and knowledgeable in his field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	0	Computer Science		3	3	1	5	475679	10/24/04	This guy is so unclear about what he wants us to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science	703	5	5	5	5	475679	12/15/09	Humorous professor to be with. Straightforward, to the point. His exams come right out of his lectures so read the lectures and practice on your own then you will definitely be fine. He requires a lot of work, so don't slack off the class! I will recommend to take his classes again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	2	475679	2/6/08	Kwon is a great guy and a great teacher. Explains everything thoroughly and actually cares that people are learning. He is a good grader too and always helpful if you need it. Just make an effort and getting an A or B is not a hard task! One of my favorites
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	1	Computer Science	123	4	4	2	4	475679	5/2/06	I had him for 3 classes in a row, Computer science 1 2 and 3. They were studio classes and I found the workload quite managable. He can sometimes be a little difficult to understand due to the language barrier. A lecture hall would be hell with him. Extremely willing to help though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	0	Computer Science		5	1	1	4	475679	3/7/05	I could not understand anything that he said and even though its a class on writing java code he never once ran one piece code as an example, if you know java take him because he does not give any homework but if you want to actually learn java avoid him
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	5	3	3	475679	1/18/05	Very nice guy, a little problem with the accent, but you'll get it very soon. Probably not the best teacher for CS 1, he tries though and he is new. Pretty sure they send all the new guys the crappy jobs like CS 1. Willing to help though. Probably better in his field of networking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Kwon	3.7	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	4	475679	10/20/04	JKwon is a really cool guy, makes jokes in class, very friendly. Some difficulty with understanding what he is talking about from time to time, and sometimes he has trouble correctly understanding and answering student questions. Definitely worth taking though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	5	402015	2/18/12	Easiness3 Helpfulness5 Clarity5 Rater Interest5 He is a very nice and respectful teacher. I really like the way he explains the material. As an international student, who have been taking 3 classes with him, I found him Fair, Fair and Fair! As a result, I'm going to regis
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		5	4	5	2	402015	10/24/11	I love Rick! He's a really nice guy. Survey was boring, but I am taking him for ritz event planning this quarter and I am pretty excited to work with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	1	Hospitality	101	4	2	3	1	402015	8/3/09	He was one of the worst teachers ever. The entire class was one long praise to all the accomplishments that he's gotten in his live. He was extremely self centered and didn't really care what was going on in his class as long as it seemed as though everyone was listening to him speak about his life and himself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		5	5	5	3	402015	2/5/09	Class is extremely easy, I put no effort in the class, and got a B. Lectures can be boring, but you actually have to put effort into failing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality	220	5	5	5	3	402015	10/23/07	He is kind of boring but easy. not too much work or quizzes. pay attention, quizzes arent that easy but you cant study for them so just pay attention and go to class- its only once a week! and occasionally class is cancelled or go off campus to volunteer at a local event.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		3	5	5	5	402015	11/9/06	Aweome Professor, very knowledgeable and important for your future career. Keeps things interesting in class, very highly recommended!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		4	4	4	NULL	402015	5/4/04	this class is one of the classes i look forward to, lagiewski is a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality	619	5	3	5	1	402015	2/1/12	Took survey of service industry with him-- good class for hospitality students, for anyone else it was almost useless. Extremely easy work and he has a good voice to listen to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		5	4	4	1	402015	10/27/09	The class is like high school business class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	1	Hospitality		5	3	3	4	402015	4/29/09	very monotone like ben stein.somewhat attractive and it overall decent. Very sarcastic but approachable after class. HE HATES STUPID QUESTIONS THAT STUDENTS CAN FIND THE ANSWER TO! OVERALL DECENT..TAKE IT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	1	Hospitality		3	2	4	3	402015	11/14/08	I was disappointed in him. He doesn't prepare you for the quizzes and the tests. I did my assignments (resume and readings) the best I could and tried my best for the quizzes and the final. I put in a lot of effort and I am disappointed in the results. Lagiewski 's lectures are boring and it felt like a waste of my time.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	0	Hospitality		3	1	1	5	402015	11/17/05	Very random. There is no syllabus, no grading policy/scale. I think he just makes things up as he goes along. Not very interesting but if you show up for class and keep up with the readings you will get A's.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	1	Hospitality		5	3	3	5	402015	5/17/05	Lots of lectures and we took field trip to a golf course. Midterm was somewhat hard but the final was a cake walk. Papers and projects are fun and you work with the team in coratia.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Lagiewski	3.7	2	Hospitality		5	5	5	NULL	402015	5/19/04	Rick is the best teacher I have had at RIT so far. The classes are easy and he makes it fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	201	4	5	5	1	1486042	1/24/13	Professor Lahnoyvich was great. I am terrible at math, but I was able to get a C in her class. Granted, I could have pushed a little harder. She was always reminding us of office hours and didn't mind briefly backtracking to lecture to explain something. She left for maternity leave the last two weeks I had her. I thought I'd cry!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	5	2	1486042	11/2/12	Professor Lahnovych is an awesome teacher. She explains material in a way that is easy to understand. She is by far the best calc teacher I have had at RIT. You DO have to work for your grade but she makes it very east to do (Do your homework and study the workshops and their solutions, especially the review workshop before exams!)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1486042	4/30/12	Great professor!!! Should take Calc A-C with her if possible. After every class you feel like you really understand the material. Tests are reasonable (especially if you understand the workshops) and quizzes are simple (if you do the hmwk). You must still be willing to put in the work though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	272	4	5	5	4	1486042	2/10/12	Prof L is the best teacher I have had at RIT. I took Calc w/ foundations 2 and Calc b with her. She does give out alot of homework problems but if you manage them, you will be good. She explains the material clearly and really wants you to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	721	5	5	5	4	1486042	11/26/11	Very approachable and provides a thorough understanding of topics taught.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	201	3	5	5	5	1486042	11/2/11	She is a good teacher, and very helpful when you ask her questions and are confused. She is also pretty hot and my friends and I never complained. As long as you put forth effort in this class, an A is very easy. PS if you don't believe she is attractive based on the picture, it isn't a great picture of her...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1486042	7/4/11	She was a really great teacher. Whenever I had trouble with a topic I either asked her after class or at office hours and in a matter of minutes if not seconds she cleared it up. keep up with the work ask questions and do the work. she's super approachable and makes the class very fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	1486042	5/18/11	Very good teacher. lot of homework it may seem unnecessary but trust me it helps you a lot. for me it was all practice. she is a bit picky about how you show work in her quizzes and tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	1486042	4/15/11	She is a teacher who knows her stuff. Her tests can be hard sometimes but she gives you some credit if you at least show your work. She is also very funny and is available when ever you need her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	4	4	1486042	2/2/11	She is a very harsh grader. I took one of her test and got a 75 on it when I only to problems were wrong, she took a lot of points for notation; despite that the answers were right.Her teaching style is good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	230	4	5	5	4	1486042	11/12/12	Lahnovych was an awesome professor. She explained everything very well and her class was not difficult so long as you payed attention and attended class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	1486042	10/18/12	Simply, Great Professer. Teaches the material very well and actually cares that everybody gets what she is saying. Excellent teaching style. Work wise, test and quizzes are responsable and, if you actually study and understand, "A" will be achievable. Recommended for any Calc course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	5	3	1486042	4/30/12	Hands down the best professor I've had since I've been here. Is always willing to help, and knows her material extremely well. The structure of her classes is incredibly conductive to learning regardless of your learning style. Would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	1	1486042	2/1/12	Terrible. I had no idea until I talked to other people and realized that calculus doesn't have to be this terrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics	271	5	5	5	3	1486042	11/13/11	Really nice professor, easy to understand and really teaches the class and makes sure the students understand what is going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	1	1486042	10/28/11	She is a very helpful teacher. If you ask her for help on a problem don't worry you WILL know the answer afterwards.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1486042	5/19/11	Great professor! Knows her stuff and is excellent at teaching it. She is very approachable and willing to answer questions. There is a fair amount of homework but it helps with understanding. If you go to class and do the work the tests and quizzes are no problem. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1486042	5/5/11	Professor L is a very laid back teacher and has a very good sense of humor. Moreover, she knows her material pretty well and has no problem explaining it to the class effectively.Quizzes and tests are OK as long as you do the homework, but she gives alot of homework probably 50 problems an assignment but it helps.easily approachable, I reccomend he
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carrie Lahnovych	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1486042	2/23/11	I had Professor Lahnovych for Calc C. Very nice teacher who is always willing to help. Knew material very well and was effective in communicating it to me. Laid back and a good sense of humor. I highly recommend Professor L. She made calculus as painless as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Lakin	2.7	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	682048	10/4/12	Susan is easy going, studio is hard but she is there ready to answer questions and help out. Her outlines for projects are not always clear. Critique is low key, helpful, but not as hard as PA critiques were. Overall I enjoyed her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Lakin	2.7	0	Fine Arts		5	1	3	3	682048	2/11/10	Susan has no spine. Don't expect to be challenged by her... even though she comes off as stern at times, she's really very nervous. I wouldn't be surprised if she has an anxiety disorder. Also, her art isn't really very good. She's used the same imagery for the past decade.. time for some new work Susan!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Lakin	2.7	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	4	682048	4/10/11	Susan basically doesn't teach. I haven't learned one thing about lighting although she grades and criticizes very harshly on it. She doesn't respond to any emails and she chooses favorites in all of her classes. If you like a teacher who grades harshly and doesn't teach take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Lakin	2.7	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	682048	11/19/08	At first I really didn't care for Susan. She talks on and on. She would get very flustered when we went into studio and would ask for help. That being said she knows what shes doing and if you ask allot of questions she will teach you a ton. The key is to just warm up to her and absorb!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Lakin	2.7	1	Fine Arts		3	3	2	5	682048	10/18/05	She tends to leave important details about assignments out. Be sure to ask her a lot of very specific questions and she will give you helpful answers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	0	Engineering		1	2	1	4	83504	11/26/12	Rushes through lectures, doesn't care if students fall behind, makes TAs do most of the work, tests/quizzes are on things not discussed in class, expects you to know as much as she does. Avoid if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	83504	5/25/12	Great professor. If your grade is borderline in the end she takes everything into consideration and may raise the grade. He lectures are just basic and sometimes confusing, however she is very helpful during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering	344	3	4	3	4	83504	3/12/12	Materials Science: Her lectures consisted of powerpoint slides and were focused on what to know to pass the tests. The material that she teaches does not seem to be important for anything other than the tests however which was unfortunate. The lectures were not particularly engaging however. Fairly average teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering	543	2	4	4	4	83504	4/23/08	I enjoyed her in class a lot. She explained everything well and if you were confused it was easy to ask her on the breaks. She didn't test on things that the class did not cover and gave equations and hints for things that we should have already learned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	83504	9/9/05	this teacher not only knows her material but is genuinely interested and concerned with her students well being. She may be unclear at times in class, but she cleans that up in her office hours. Also she is always giving independent study classes. We need more marcas in the mechie department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	0	Engineering		3	2	2	5	83504	5/8/05	does she know her stuff? hmmmmm.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	1	Engineering		3	3	3	NULL	83504	4/14/04	marca, marca, marca.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	1	Engineering		3	3	2	NULL	83504	4/30/03	Sometimes seems to have more memorized knowledge than actual knowledge. Often is unclear in describing. Will, however, help outside of class and will continue to try to explain something until it makes sense.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		4	4	3	NULL	83504	3/7/03	I like tall chicks
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		2	5	3	NULL	83504	1/28/03	Very helpful, knowlegeable & enthusiastic--material is tough, though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	1	Engineering		3	3	2	3	83504	6/3/12	The lectures were almost intolerable to sit through. Too much information is covered with very little structure or explanation. She teaches as if it's all common sense and there's no depth to the material. Don't expect to learn much on the subject, if anything. The tests focus on problems with little relevance to the lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	0	Engineering		1	1	2	4	83504	5/18/12	Lectures on the most general concepts in the course, while the tests cover the tiniest most inconsequential details. Grades extremely harshly and absolutely does not care about students falling behind as she moves over material faster than Speedy Gonzales. Obviously an expert in her field and expects you to be too. Recommend avoiding her class,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		3	5	4	4	83504	10/26/10	Liked the class a lot. sometimes things are unclear simply because class demos are rushed, but there were 4 TA's who constantly helped everyone out. I had a great time and did pretty well. if you try, you will succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	1	Engineering		2	3	2	1	83504	1/31/07	Prof. Lam-Anderson is new to RIT, and I had her for her first two quarters. She was still adjusting, albeit, but her class was still extraordinarily difficult. She holds no sympathy for students, and her tests are difficult. She doesn't seem to understand the level at which she should be teaching, and, in a way, teachers too much information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	0	Engineering		4	2	2	5	83504	5/11/05	nice smile, but...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		4	5	2	NULL	83504	7/18/04	Bad teacher/Easy grader: I got an A, but have no knowledge of the subject. Unprofessional: She's grinding the same axe as Dean Baum, and it comes through a little too often.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	0	Engineering	100	5	1	1	NULL	83504	12/4/03	basis of argument not founded by basic laws of thermodynamics and explanations are way too simplistic to even comprehend the true essense of materials science....... bad....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marca Lam-Anderson	2.9	2	Engineering		3	5	5	NULL	83504	4/18/03	Great prof., Class is easy as long as you go to class and do the homework. The material can get tough, but she makes it easy to learn

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	806992	2/8/13	Very condescending and makes things more complicated than they are. would rather have watched the stat talks from mymathlab than go to her class. also goes into more detail than is covered in the book and puts it on the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	319	4	2	1	1	806992	11/11/12	Worst teacher I've ever had. She is just not able to teach freshmen, but she definitley knows the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	806992	7/8/12	She is an extremely fair grader and gives TONS of opportunities to make up points and do better. She is helpful when asked for help and gives lots of time for homework to be finished. Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	320	3	2	2	2	806992	5/21/12	She's unclear. I can see that she has thoughts in her head but she doesn't know how to properly convey them. She often forgets to teach some things and doesn't realize it until a student questions it. Some of the things she teaches are irrelevant and are the hard way of doing it. You'll pass the class, but hate it by the end. Don't take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics	319	4	3	3	2	806992	2/6/12	Decent professor, sometimes not entirely clear about the material. Had her for Data Analysis 1. The homework is online and is hardly related to class material (it is from the textbook, which is never referred to by the teacher, and you have to keep up with homework yourself, she doesn't remind you). Not a particularly fun teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	225	3	5	4	4	806992	10/21/11	I found Professor Lanciaux extremely helpful. She always went out of her way to see if I was stuck on a problem. She prepares you well for your exam and she tells you where the problems will be from. (Your Textbook) Overall I enjoyed going to her class and I hate math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	806992	8/3/11	She made sure everyone understood the material and took the time to explain everything. A great teacher and easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	320	2	5	4	3	806992	5/31/11	A very fair professor. As long as you do your work, a grade of A is attainable. She is very helpful and approachable. She also gives plenty of opportunities for extra credits. Use her review sessions and office hours to your advantage!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	806992	3/23/11	She is the worst ever !! Doing the homework finding non of the notes helps!! She's so ugly that she thinks everyone knows the stuff and fly through the lecture. And then she gives the work sheet right after the lecture ! HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO DO THAT !!!!???
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	225	5	2	2	2	806992	11/25/10	This class was a waste of my time but a nice GPA booster. We spent more time correcting her mistakes in the notes than learning. She's unorganized and not very helpful outside of the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	225	4	5	5	3	806992	11/24/12	Very good professor. If you attend class and pay attention you'll do great! Answers all questions and makes everything easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	319	3	1	2	2	806992	10/19/12	She's incredibly annoying, I have her now for Data Analysis 1 and I completely dislike her. She needs a silent classroom and complains if somebody is falling asleep even though she knows the lecture is boring. She doesn't teach well and gets lost. Nice with grading but irritating at the best of times. Don't take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	806992	6/7/12	Sort of difficult class, but if you attend class and pay attention, it's not bad. She's helpful when you seek assistance. The online work is the hardest part and is very time consuming.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	3	806992	2/17/12	She is a fair teacher but if your trying to learn something dont take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	2	806992	10/27/11	Probably the worst professor I have ever had. Often times she won't explain a single thing and just gives a worksheet. When she does try explaining things it usually leaves most people confused. If you take her class you will either fail or figure out how to learn material without the professors help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics		4	4	2	1	806992	8/15/11	Professor was very fast paced. Test material was either you know it/studied or don't study and failed. Very fair towards grades: many extra credit opportunities. Voice sort of mono-toned, may be hard to keep awake. Overall fair teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	1	806992	6/18/11	um.. where to begin.. you learn nothing in this class. the end. avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	2	806992	5/5/11	I have absolutely learned nothing in this class. goes through 90+ powerpoint slides in 60 minutes and then gives out a workshop for the last 60 min. AVOID IF POSSIBLE. She makes this class 100 times harder than it has to be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	225	4	5	5	1	806992	1/26/11	EXCELLENT TEACHER! she is always available for extra help and will go over something as many times as you need until you understand it. Offers extra credit. I am taking an 8am class next quarter just so I can have her as my teacher again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	3	806992	11/20/10	Not a very helpful teacher, more time was spent correcting her math mistakes in the notes she gave us than learning anything. Avoid this prof if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	2	806992	10/27/10	I got a D in the class by 1 point and according to her mycourses grade book she didn't even include 4 of my assignments in that grade, to my detriment. Brought it up after the quarter and brought her the assignments (driving 3 hours) still got the D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	320	3	4	3	2	806992	7/26/10	I thought she was a decent professor. She will help you if you ask for it but she won't give you the answer. You need to keep up because she gives a LOT of assignments, but they are all helpful. You need to like webassign if you are going to take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	806992	4/26/10	Don't take her if you aren't a fast learner. Otherwise, the class is a lot of work but fairly easy and you learn a lot. She gives a lot of oportunities for extra credit, including EC if you come to class. Enough work that if you do bad on an assignment or 2 its not a big deal.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	806992	1/21/10	She was very helpful during class and extremely understanding when you missed a test or homework. She also gave chances for extra credit and had office hours for help. Overall, good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		4	1	3	2	806992	1/26/09	Demanded I handwrite all hw assignments despite a broken collarbone on the side of the hand I write with & unwilling to bend despite this circumstance which happened week 8 of the qtr. Even with a B avg she told me to 'give up the class' or withdraw from a class central to my major. She looked insulted that I showed up for the final - which I aced
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	3	806992	11/21/08	I didn't find this class particularly difficult--if you actually read/skim the book, pay attention in class, and do the WebAssign work, you'll do fine. The worksheets can get a little repetitive, but it was okay. She wasn't always that clear on her answers, but the review sessions definitely helped.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	806992	4/4/08	Horrible! She hardly goes over any of the calculations that she assigns for homework, and just goes over vocabulary during class! She is far by the worst teacher I have ever had at RIT! Homework is online, and very frusterating. My class just had a test, and the mean was as low as it goes. Says so much to her teaching skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	2	806992	11/12/07	She cannot communicate the material and it makes stats extreemly hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics	379	5	1	1	1	806992	2/28/07	Horrible! The only way I can put it nicely. Not only can you be hungover and make to class before her but her instruction level is that of a kindergarten teacher! Everything is on myCourses but she takes attendance. Not much help with project and labs are complacently simple but if not done to her exact specifications, she'll rip you a new one!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	2	806992	1/26/07	Terrible at explanations...better to not listen at all and just use the book. Not effective at answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	2	806992	10/27/10	I knew the material prior to entering this course so I breezed through it, but if I had been just learning it as some of my classmates, I would have failed. She can't explain the concepts well. I had to help many students in my class on homework and worksheets because she just confused them when they asked her for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	806992	7/24/10	This professor is very bad. Her class is boring. She is not helpful at all. Her exams are nothing related to the material from class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics	320	4	5	4	3	806992	4/26/10	Great to work with. A lot of work that is intimating in the beginning but as long as you put in the time and effort she makes it easy. Lectures with powerpoint, puts the notes up for the entire quarter, extremely helpful, always available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	2	806992	2/9/09	I can't really complain. Even though class required a ridiculous amount of work and was really boring,she gave me an A with an 89. She also gave many options for extra credit. At least taking her course helped me Ace my Research Methods/Stats class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	3	806992	12/3/08	She was extremely confusing, and left us to struggle on our own during class. Shw mainly went over the vocab from the night before's homework. Homework was all online, and was -extremely- long. She would assign homework to be done the day of class, and then she would teach how to do it after it was due. I wouldn't reccommend her as a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	806992	5/3/08	I admit, I hated the amount of work that she assigned online during the quarter. But she is a very nice professor, and willing to help when you go to her office. Tests can be hard, but she offers extra credit several times. U can also go to her with your portfolio at the end of the quarter if you don't think your grade matched up with your effor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	806992	1/16/08	She Fails. She is by far the worst professor ever. Don't ask for help in class, you will get "It is my job to make you not need me. Ask your neighbor." All of her assignments are online. I asked if there was extra credit I could do, I received a screen shot of the calendar. She is that bad, and I pity anyone that has to take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	2	1	2	806992	5/1/07	She does not explain things clear--AT ALL. Don't ask questions in class. You'll just get even more confused. Most of the time she just reads off of the power points that are presented in class. If you want to pass this class, I suggest you to get a tutor because her teaching really sucks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	806992	2/26/07	Expects an elaborate report/presentation at the end of the semester and offers little guidance throughout the quarter. When entering the lab she expects you to start on the lab via a document posted online. There is little to no instruction on what to do for each lab. About 95% of the lab was to figure things out on your own. Don't take her LAB!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	1	Mathematics		4	2	3	2	806992	1/12/07	I took her micro economics class her first quarter as a professor. Tells lots of stories in class. Seemed to be bad with technology and lectured from the board most of the time. Gets confused, but covers material well enough. Tests aren't hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	2	Mathematics		4	2	5	3	806992	11/20/06	Lectured from power point slides the entire time, gave quizes online for the majority of the class. Fairly easy class, did not answer a lot of in class questions, this was a simple class to get by on
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	2	1	1	806992	2/2/06	Very nice and more than willing to meet outside of class, but not effective. Very confusing, contradicts some of material in books, and frequently responds to questions with "we'll come back to that..." but never actually does. Class averages range from high to very low, inconsistantly. Not recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bernadette Lanciaux	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	806992	12/4/06	TERRIBLE teacher. Not very clear at all. She's not good at getting her point across and doesn't seem to know her stuff. Took the class over & went from an F (from her) to an A with someone else!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	102	5	5	5	5	873250	3/11/13	By far the best professor I have ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	336	5	5	5	4	873250	3/11/13	The best professor in the ME department (maybe even the school). 350 characters is nowhere near enough to describe the passion, attention to detail, and clarity of this amazing professor. Makes course expectations clear and spends extra time on material students have had trouble understanding in the past. Would definitely take him again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	102	5	5	5	4	873250	2/27/13	Was an awesome professor. I went to lecture and recitation because he explained the material in a way so I could understand. He is genuine and wants to help his students. One of the nicest professors I have had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	102	2	5	5	5	873250	11/20/12	Excellent professor. Had him for my first quarter and I was thrilled to have him. Answers questions efficiently, effectively, and clearly, and does a very good job explaining every concept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	873250	4/24/12	Great teacher, goes over everything in detail in lecture. Always available for homework help. Best engineering professor I've had here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	343	2	5	5	5	873250	6/14/10	Landschoot is one of the best. He know his stuff, presents it very clear, and encourages questions. Definitely take a class from him if you get the chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	343	4	5	5	3	873250	2/24/10	Great professor. Extremely helpful and explains everything clearly with examples sometimes. Not required to come to class. Hw comes straight from problems at the end of the chapters in the book. Quizzes are same as these hw problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	101	5	5	5	4	873250	12/15/09	Amazing prof. Explains things really well. Homeworks are pretty easy. I would recommend him to anyone
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	873250	1/22/09	Excellent professor. He explains everything completely and thoroughly. He is a very fair grader. He also made class very interesting and I enjoyed it. If you have to take Materials Processing, take it with Landschoot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	873250	2/3/07	Awesome teacher, very helpful and very clear. Tests and quizzes are graded fairly. He is young, and has experience in industry. Highly reccomended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	102	4	5	5	5	873250	3/11/13	Landschoot is one of the best teachers that I have ever had! He is very clear in what he expects of you and is very open to questions. He really cares about your understanding of the material and will do his best to make sure that you learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	873250	3/11/13	Best Prof EVAR
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	102	4	5	5	5	873250	1/18/13	He's efficient and clear, and has a very engaging teaching style. You will know the material when you're done with the class.. guaranteed. Definitely take a class with him if you get a chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	3	873250	10/23/12	Great guy and professor. He was one of the best professors I have ever had. Very clear and very helpful and knows how to teach
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	415	4	5	5	5	873250	11/12/10	BEST ENGINEERING TEACHER EVER! His lectures are worth every second. Great explanation, great examples, he really cares about his students! HIGHLY recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	413	4	5	5	4	873250	5/20/10	Best professor in the thermo sequence, and arguably in the whole engineering science sequence. Very clear, perfect balance of examples and theory, energetic, answered questions well, pointed out common mistakes to avoid when solving problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	873250	2/19/10	The best thermo/fluids techer in the ME department. If you can get into his class before it fills up TAKE HIM! He explains the material really well, so not only will you be able to do the problems and do well on the common test, you will actually understand the material!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering	101	5	5	5	5	873250	2/1/09	Great professor, loves what he does and is willing to help you whenever you ask for it. Although he likes to talk about fuel injectors a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	3	873250	5/21/07	Good prof. Knows his poo. Likes early morning classes. No idea how he does it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	873250	12/4/06	Easiest four credits in the world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Landschoot	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	873250	9/6/06	What a guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		4	4	4	4	67469	4/21/11	Great professor. Classes were a little dry but overall, he taught awesome stuff. It's such a sad thing that he's gone and that no one else will know what a wonderful teacher he was.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		4	5	4	3	67469	4/19/11	He was a great teacher for gen chem and his memory live on in all his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	5	4	2	67469	2/4/11	Extremely helpful professor and an excellent guy. Tests and homework are very difficult though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	5	4	2	67469	10/31/10	A great teacher, take him if you can. The class can be challenging at times, but he is super helpful. Go to his office hours!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	4	4	3	67469	11/4/08	Monotone voice and boring lectures but overall nice guy. Drops the lowest test grade which is nice because his tests are damn near impossible. The online HWs are difficult too-- super finicky about your answers and usually cover things we haven't even learned yet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		3	5	4	5	67469	9/5/08	He is an excellent teacher who never gives up on any students so long as a student is willing to work hard. His lectures are difficult to comprehend if you do not have the background but overall he is a great teacher and wonderful person. The amount of material you learn outside the class if you can find him is enough to pass the class very easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science	101	2	5	5	5	67469	2/4/07	Excellent lectures! Organized and a great sense of humor! He is dedicated and willing to help me achieve a clear understandign of the subject matter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science		1	2	3	2	67469	10/24/06	his class is very hard and he uses these olnine homeworks that take about 4 to 6 hours or more to complete. its crazy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		3	4	3	4	67469	5/5/06	He is a really friendly guy outside of class, and his office hours help somewhat. (if you actually get a chance to talk with him.) be prepared to teach yourself everything right out of the book, his lectures are dry and fast and almost pointless to attend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science		2	3	2	2	67469	2/14/06	Boring as hell, need to work on his presentation, but a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science	211	4	5	4	2	67469	4/20/11	Great chemistry professor. Incredible guy, really cares about his students. Truly upsetting that he's passed on now. May he rest in peace.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	0	Science	202	1	1	2	3	67469	2/15/11	He doesn't respond my email and I dont know why. his tests and homeworks are hard but you will actually learn stuffs. My schedule doesn't match his recitation section so Id rather depends on myself. I dont like him tho, but he's a nice one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science	215	3	5	3	4	67469	11/24/10	Lectures are boring and monotone but is a very good teacher and is always willing to help. Online homework is hard but helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	0	Science		2	2	2	3	67469	9/22/10	His power points are completely useless. I got SO lost, especially because on mycourses, they are in a different order than he presents. Some aren't even there! Easier to just keep up with the reading by yourself in the book. Recitation n tests are HARD, REALLY hard, but he does let u use a cheat sheet. but it's week 3 so we;ll see haha
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science		1	4	2	1	67469	10/23/08	Dr. Langner is very willing to help. I think this class was very difficult and I struggled through the entire thing. The school should have a pre-req for someone who has never taken chemistry. I am hoping the next 2 sections get better!! From what I have been told, if you have to take this class Dr. Langner is the one to get.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science	217	2	5	4	2	67469	8/22/07	Great teacher... if you go to class. Make sure to read the book and study the quizzes during the week (online) for the tests (most questions are similar to these) Go to class too, because about 1/3 of the questions come directly from lecture. Good teacher if you go to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science	215	1	4	2	1	67469	11/9/06	very difficult class, especially if chem is not your cup of tea. def. go to recitation and do HW. lectures... print out notes-- other then that, it's not really necessary to go. tests are very hard, especially for the short amount of time. you basically teach yourself out of the book...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science		4	3	3	1	67469	10/19/06	His lectures are so boring, and he doesn't really count attendance since it's in an auditorium. Just go to recitation, do the homework, and go to class for tests. It's so pointless to attend. Only go to class if you want clicker bonus points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		3	5	5	2	67469	3/8/06	Good teacher. Kinda boring and monotone, and his class is 8 in the morning. Never went to class and still got a B. You would have to be an idiot to get less than a B. Has a total of 5 test grades and only counts 4. Definitly recomended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	1	Science		2	3	3	2	67469	2/8/06	Nice as he is, he's also pretty boring and the subject's pretty difficult. I also find that he's not very good at explaining things in class. =/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	4	4	1	67469	12/8/05	Nice guy. I slept through a test and he let me take it after he said no retakes. if you're not a morning person there is a lot of catching up and outside work involved. he's def. a monotone. test's were fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	4	4	1	67469	11/1/05	Dito on the last entry. Monotone @ 8am...not good. But a great teacher sometime in the afternoon. Record lectures and listen to them later if your not a morning person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science	216	4	5	5	5	67469	10/23/05	this teacher is very good. he's really care about the students progress and really able to help you. i love this teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		4	4	4	3	67469	10/5/05	awesome teacher, I love how he teaches and paces the course for us all to better understand!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		2	5	3	4	67469	11/14/05	a good teacher overall, could work on his voice, very monotone, and explain things a little bit clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		3	4	4	3	67469	10/26/05	Decent teacher but monotone and it is impossible to stay awake at 8 AM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		4	5	5	5	67469	10/22/05	The best professor in RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andreas Langner	3.8	2	Science		1	5	4	NULL	67469	5/16/04	very good, but a lot of work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert  Laport	3.5	2	Science		3	3	4	1	1766721	11/14/12	When writing papers if they are not in his words then you will fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Giuseppe Larizza	1.5	0	Science Technology & Society		5	2	2	4	1183736	2/8/11	Material is frequently outdated and presented as an OVERHEAD. seriously?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Giuseppe Larizza	1.5	0	Science Technology & Society	211	4	2	1	1	1183736	10/3/08	Drones on and on. Falling asleep is inevitable. Even browsing the internet it is so difficult to even maintain alertness. His voice is just so... monotonous. He also manages to make it seem entirely reasonable to talk to yourself, as he constantly does this. Asking rhetorical questions that he answers to himself. Do not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Giuseppe Larizza	1.5	0	Science Technology & Society		3	1	1	3	1183736	12/7/08	wow this guy isnt audible past the first row. He speaks in a single tone which makes the most interesting topics boring. His tests are multiple choice and very short answer which are pretty difficult, but manageable. Do not recommend unless you are as boring as this guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	0	Ethnic Studies		4	2	2	1	907555	10/3/08	We have him for Science and Technology. The course is easy, you dont have to be here to do quizzes because they are all deductive multiple choice, but his voice lulls you to sleep, and with very little student interaction, and rhetorical questions, he talks to himself and you cannot help but fall asleep. Bring a laptop or some NoDoze
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	0	Ethnic Studies	202	3	1	2	3	907555	2/5/08	Lectures are useless and boring, just briefly read the chapter in the book and you'll get 100's on the quizzes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	1	Ethnic Studies		3	3	3	1	907555	10/12/07	I had him for Science Technology and Values and it was extremely boring. He tends to talk alot about nuclear science and i get so lost! The class is pretty easy as long as you do the reading. Overall he is a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	0	Ethnic Studies		3	2	2	1	907555	5/20/08	If you love nuclear science, you will enjoy this class. Otherwise, totally avoid it. This was the most boring and hated liberal arts I have taken and I would not recommend it to anyone unless they took a different teacher. His lectures are so pointless, because he skips around and reads directly from the pages, and then tries to crack jokes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	2	Ethnic Studies		5	5	4	3	907555	10/23/07	Very easy class if you read the material. He's very boring, but a great person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josepe Larriza	3.0	2	Ethnic Studies		5	5	5	5	907555	3/5/07	Had him for Science & Tech Values. Liked the class so much that I took his other class, Energy & the Environment, the very next quarter. Neither class required attendace or hw, just two 15pt quizzes, a 25pt paper and a 45pt midterm. Multiple choice, matching, t/f, and a few short answer. Very friendly Italian guy.. easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Labella	3.0	2	Design		4	5	5	5	923971	1/28/09	great professor loved her class, she is more than willing to help out. one of the best professors i have had at school she really knows what she is talking about and as long as you put forth an effort you will get a good grade :)

Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		3	4	5	4	958659	2/23/13	The class was hard but he gave huge curves exam and many extra credits. I ended up with an A because of extra credits. He is helpful but slow when responding to emails, but he gave out phone number which is good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law	319	4	5	4	4	958659	3/13/12	Curves the tests and assignments SO MUCH and gives a lot of extra credit. If you go to class and have the ability to read it's hard not to get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		2	5	4	2	958659	11/10/11	Great lecturer, but material can get boring. Asks a lot of trick questions on exams, but they are open book/open note. Gives a few homeworks and extra credit assignments throughout the course. VERY helpful if you call/see him in office hours. I'd recommend recording his lectures because he covers some things not in the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		2	5	4	4	958659	11/12/09	Great professor--there's a lot of material, which can be dry but he gets it across. You'll need to pay a lot of attention in class in order to take in what he's saying. The tests are open notes and book, but they're still tough, but he curves them, a lot. He knows his stuff inside and out and he's always there to help for cases and anything else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		2	5	4	3	958659	5/18/09	professor is very laid back and gives you his cell number to call at any time if you need help. the lectures are dry and the tests are difficult. gives bonus assignments but those aren't a walk in the park. i personally enjoyed learning about law so it was bareable. would not recommend course for those wanting to fill up an easy elective.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	0	Law		2	2	1	1	958659	11/16/08	Coming in as a first year, with no prior law knowledge, it is VERY difficult to sit through such a dry and intense class. The tests are all open book, but you won't find any of the answers in the book... He tests on concepts that are way above my knowledge even with paying attention in class. Don't take unless you're required to. It's boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		1	5	3	2	958659	5/22/07	Class is very challanging. Tests are open book and open notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	1	Law	101	2	3	2	4	958659	10/16/12	Unless you are a law major, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM! He changed his course and there is no longer open book exams. HE lectures on the book, gives practice exams following what he taught, then gives exams based everything but what was talked about in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		4	5	5	5	958659	11/20/11	Great professor. Knows his stuff and teaches the course well. Extra credit given at the end. Grading is 85% exams 15% hw. One of the best professors Ive had at RIT. (Business Law Course)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law	319	2	4	3	2	958659	5/12/10	Legal environment of business. 0110-319. Laid back professor, very helpful when you need help. lectures are very very dry, not exactly his fault. very easy grader, but requires you to do your part. tests are open book and open note, but not as easy as you'd hope. optional assignments for extra credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law	300	3	5	4	4	958659	10/13/09	Great guy. If you had questions he would circle back and answer them. Would practically give you the right answers on case studies if you called him at home. Always available. This class was mandatory for me to take and it was still enjoyable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law		1	4	4	3	958659	12/7/08	Tough course. Do all the homework and work hard and you'll get a good grade. You never know how you do on tests in his class, they are full of tricks so go slow. He curves everything even your final grade. There were a number of exams that I got less then half correct but still got an A. He teaches the 300 level like the MBA course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	1	Law	319	2	4	2	3	958659	10/9/08	Information is difficult and tests are impossible. Do extra credit if offered at end of quarter!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephen Lagrou	3.9	2	Law	300	2	5	4	5	958659	2/15/07	Good professor, information can be boring. Class is a lecture and review questions. Tests are very tricky, but you can do well on them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wafa Laith	4.5	2	Engineering	404	3	5	4	4	1234015	12/22/08	Great prof. knows what they are doing and always there in times of need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Lalonde	3.2	2	Statistics	714	4	5	4	4	1657594	2/25/12	I disagree with the previous review. Dr. Lalonde is incredibly helpful and I found his tests to be more than fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Lalonde	3.2	0	Statistics	714	2	2	2	2	1657594	12/3/11	Dr. LaLonde does not really focus on teaching. He just challenges his students with hard exams. Grading is straight-forward but knowledge is not really conveyed through. Online lecture slides are boring with a monotonous voice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathleen Lamkin-Kennard	5.0	2	Engineering	870	4	5	5	4	1651665	11/23/11	Great teacher. For Math for Engineers I & II she provides her own hand written notes with examples and EVERYTHING you need to understand the material. She has a great personality and is a very fair grader. Expect to be challenged with Test and quizzes but well prepared because she teaches very clearly. Definitely recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	2	Engineering		4	4	4	4	1486652	1/20/13	He has definitely grown on me since CPA, I get why he doesn't always give much time to do things now because you have to be efficient as an engineer. That being said he gives just enough time on tests now and is overall a much better teacher than I originally gave him credit for
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	5	3	1486652	3/1/12	Perfectly structured class. Taught exactly what you need to know, how to apply it, and when to use it. Gives clear notes and lectures followed by example problems. The homework is weighed the same as an exam. Lowest exam dropped. Fair graders and good attitude. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	2	Engineering	309	4	5	5	5	1486652	4/25/11	He is the perfect teacher. Clear notes on white board, does examples, then lets the class try one. Hw is required but rly helps you prepare for the exams; the exams tend to be easier than the hw. His teaching style is easy to learn with. Definitely take his classes. A plus is that you dont NEED to buy the books, he will print out tables for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	1	Engineering	309	3	3	3	5	1486652	10/15/12	Good person, however he gives little time on exams and in class problems. He explains things very well but he does not seem to understand that some of his students are much more analytic than others. In reality if you make a mistake in engineering you could accidentally kill people or easily get fired, and I don't see how rushing students helps
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	2	Engineering	230	4	4	4	2	1486652	11/14/11	Subject matter was not my favorite however, I was content with Dr. Landi's instruction.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Landi	4.2	2	Engineering		3	4	5	5	1486652	2/3/11	Not overly difficult. Frankly a lot of people in his class were just plain stupid
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Lange	4.2	2	Business		4	5	5	5	118249	2/14/06	Great teacher, helps a lot and anyone whos taking pc hardware I and II, highly reccomend this professor to you!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Lange	4.2	1	Business		2	3	2	NULL	118249	1/28/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna Lange	4.2	2	Business		4	5	5	5	118249	11/14/04	She's a really fun, and interesting, I would recommend her to others who are in PCHW1 and/or 2 I wouldn't mind taking her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	216	4	5	4	4	725252	1/30/13	This teacher, is not only interesting by given examples to help you understand material, but also He will act out the behaviors of atoms and is very interactive. it is possible to get a 200% in his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	5	725252	11/1/12	He is talks in the third person, but is very helpful with his chemgod.com website
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		5	4	5	3	725252	3/8/12	Was very nervous about Chem as I didn't really understand it in High School, but the text was great and his lectures were good reinforcement of the material. Easy A if you do the homework, extra credit, and pay attention. He allows a "cheat sheet" that you can use for all the tests and drops the lowest test grade so you can skip the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	4	4	4	4	725252	12/15/11	Looks intimidating, but he's okay. An easy A course. Quite helpful and always response to email. For those who are complaining, maybe you should study like a college student, not like a high school student, waiting for the teacher to feed everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	215	5	2	3	3	725252	11/28/11	Easy A. Generous with extra and partial credit. Drops lowest 100 out of 500 points, which can be attendance or a test. Recommended that you attend, as that is where many extra points can come from. Not very helpful outside of class or in recitation, but tests are fairly straightforward and easy if you do the homework and go to recitation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	215	4	1	2	3	725252	11/15/11	He's not a bad professor, he just doesn't really make an effort to do any work outside of the classroom for the students. He gives a lot of extra credit though, so getting an A isn't too hard. The tests are quality over quantity, but if you even vaguely pay attention they're reasonable, and his partial credit it fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	101	4	3	4	4	725252	10/26/10	So, i've got over 100 in his class since there are pre-class bonus assignments, and the homeworks are fairly easy. Do all the work, go to class, and you will get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	101	5	4	3	3	725252	7/14/10	Class was easy, and there were plenty of opportunities for extra credit. He's also funny in class, and often switches between whiteboard and powerpoint, which I like. The only bad thing is his tests are only 4 or 5 questions, but you are able to get partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	5	2	2	2	725252	4/21/10	Not the best teacher for learning, but he's a nice guy with easy grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	5	2	2	3	725252	2/13/10	Terrible lecturer but makes the class work easy. Gives tons of extra credit opportunities, tests are easy to pass due to the amount of partial credit he gives, asks clicker questions in class for extra credit. He is also funny (or at the very least entertaining) in a 9am class.Don't bother with office hours but he's good with emails.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	217	5	3	3	3	725252	12/7/12	Took gen chem 3 with him. Way too easy. Almost everyone in the class got an A. Had near a 110 at the end of the quarter. The inflation allows people to get grades they don't deserve. Too much extra credit as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		3	3	4	1	725252	4/27/12	Easiest General Chemistry Lecture to get an A in. Nuff said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	216	4	2	4	3	725252	3/1/12	Has a lot of extra credit, drops your lowest test grade. Allows you to use a cheat sheet. The kinda teacher that will bump you up to an A if you have an 88. Class was not that hard, creates a lot of opportunities to help you get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	215	4	2	3	5	725252	12/14/11	I love chemistry, but this guy manages to make it not so fun. He teaches bare minimum, and repeats himself an excessive amount of times. Easy A though. If you get chemistry and just want to get a good grade take him; if you want to really enjoy the class, don't. Unless Bailey is your other option....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	215	2	1	2	1	725252	11/27/11	He makes claims that he drops the lowest 100 out of 500 points, then doesn't follow through.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	4	4	5	4	725252	11/12/11	Not really understanding why so many people are saying he's a bad teacher. If you take advantage of the extra credit and pay attention in class it's an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	152	2	4	4	2	725252	8/30/10	I took Lanzafame for chem 2 at MCC over the summer. He was really funny and used quite twisted analogies to make complex concepts seem simple. Definitely recommended for summer term.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	101	3	4	4	3	725252	4/28/10	Attendance isn't mandatory, but the daily clicker questions that amount to a lot of extra credit's helpful in the long run. His tests are harder (3~5 with work!) but it's an incentive to study. Homeworks are shorter. Not a bad lecturer at at all, and is quite funny. Honestly can't see why some people complained.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	216	5	5	5	3	725252	3/3/10	Awesome. Best ever. Don't know why some people complain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	101	4	2	4	5	725252	10/27/09	Good guy with good intentions, not the best teacher. If you dont know anything about chemistry when going into this class, I suggest switching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry		2	2	2	2	725252	10/22/09	Terrible teacher! DO NOT TAKE HIM! Assumes EVERYONE knows everything & a lot of chemistry before even taking intro. Tests are only 3-4 questions even MIDTERM & FINAL EXAMS! and they are very hard and confusing. Even though he requires you to go to every class you learn nothing and he goes a mile a minute explaining nothing with horrible analogies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	215	1	1	1	4	725252	9/2/09	Two quarters of hell. Useless professor but a cool guy. Feel bad for saying it, but take Dr. Langner if you can. :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	3	725252	2/16/09	If you ask him for help, don't expect anything useful. Absolutely no help with questions and class is useless and you have to attend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	5	3	5	4	725252	11/26/08	I don't get all of the negativity thrown at Professor Lanzafame. If you come to class and get your free clicker bonus points (I had about 30 extra points), there's no way you should not get a 100 in this class. The tests are really easy too. He was good in recitation as well. Plus, his mole dance is quite entertaining as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	2	4	4	4	725252	8/26/08	lanz is awesome!!! he's always around for office hours and i'd suggest taking advantage of that. He wont always tell you exactly how to do a problem but he'll lead you there so that you actually learn. Tests are open book but challenging..He always give out extra credit and drops your lowest test score. FAVORITE TEACHER!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	1	1	2	2	725252	6/3/08	He is a HORRIBLE professor! In class it was like he was speaking another language. The homeworks were very hard and he refused to give help or would make rude comments if you requested help. The tests were usually 4 problems for your 50 min class,usually at the end of the 50 mins there would still be half of the 200 person lecture there. DONT TAKE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	1	1	1	1	725252	4/12/08	worst chem teacher ever!! don't take he, he teaches with cookies, and asks about unreal compounds
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	1	1	2	4	725252	3/11/08	Awful, uninterested teacher. You will learn very little. Has little to no interest in individual's success. Avoid at all costs. I asked for some extra help 6 times and he blew me off in a ten week period!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	2	1	2	1	725252	2/19/08	out of all the professors i have had since attending, he is by far one of the worst. he offers no degree of leniency when it comes to a student seeking a chance for grade improvement and when it comes to contacting him, he is cold to say the least. questions get sluffed off as if they were a bother and he avoids emails seeking help or "advice".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	4	725252	11/27/07	Great teacher. Very easy grader. Hard to fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	151	3	2	2	3	725252	9/26/09	good guy not the most helpful guy but if he likes you, you will do good in the class from the bonus points...also loves blondes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	152	3	4	3	4	725252	7/15/09	pretty cool
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	205	1	1	1	3	725252	1/28/09	This guy is probably the worst teacher I have ever had. His tests, hw, and quizzes are impossible. He basically gets pleasure out of students failing. Sure, he gives bonus points, but not nearly enough to make up for other grades. He is completely unwilling to work with your learning style. Do NOT take him as a chem teacher if you want to pass!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	2	4	3	1	725252	10/17/08	Took for 215-217. Could be very hard to follow in lecture at times. A rather difficult class after 215 if you have little experience in Chemistry. However, tests are open book and open note, so that helps. Also, he's very good with giving partial credit on exams and homework. Quick grading. Overall, definitely not the worse teacher I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		3	4	4	2	725252	6/25/08	Most kids don't come to class (attendance isn't mandatory PLUS its at an evil 8AM), then they fail the class and have the nerve to complain. Even if you suck at chem (like me)...just go to class more than half the time, stay awake and pay mild attention. You'll get at least a B (Talking from experience) A lil effort outside class and you have an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	214	1	1	1	3	725252	4/15/08	This guy is very inappropriate in class. I didn't learn from him. I went from an A student to a C because I couldn't figure out his confusing tests. The lecture is on one thing, hws and quizzes another, and then the test is on a completely different subject. You honestly don't know what to study. Do yourself a huge favor and TAKE THOMAS KIM!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	2	1	1	4	725252	4/3/08	ok where to start? DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR ANYTHING! I took AP Advanced Chem in high school, therefore most of this material in Gen & anyl II was review for me. This guy is terrible, he has no idea how to teach, has 4 ?'s per test that are like riddles and likes tricking students. Forget about help from him, he just blows you off!Take Thomas Kim!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry	212	4	4	1	4	725252	2/20/08	Extremely unprofessional, completely ambiguious in every topic he teaches, too light and easy going. If you've already learned chemistry and just need the credit, take the class. But if your trying to learn, he is horrible at it. Inconistent questions with the book, u can't really learn by the book. open book, because he doesn't use the book ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	2	2	1	4	725252	2/3/08	Awful teacher. He is very unclear, gives impossible quizzes online, gives homework due the day of the est that has NOTHING to do with the test, and if everyone fails a test, hell claim its the students fault. Worst teacher ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	215	5	5	5	3	725252	11/2/07	I have no idea what the other people are talking about! This class is super easy. Prof. is a very easy grader. Tests are OPEN BOOK. Online quizzes are great, and homework problems are exactly the same as test questions. Lectures are boring, but don't really need to go to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	216	4	3	5	2	725252	10/23/07	He's not as bad as a lot of students make him out to be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry		1	3	2	3	725252	10/17/07	Horrible teacher, the tests, quizzes, and homework are nothing that he teaches us in class and has nothing to do what we use in lab. Everything is understandable in class until you get to doing the exams which are open notes, but notes--not even the book helps! Avoid this teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	725252	2/12/07	AVOID THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS! goes by Chemgod. He's horrible. Doesn't care if you learn anything or not. Tests + quizzes are awful. The Q's are completely different than the ones you practice in class. doesn't really teach, just reads off of his PP presentations. Won't give you any help if you approach him for assistance. seriously, avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	1	Chemistry		5	3	3	3	725252	12/16/05	This guy is new to the technology here at RIT. So he has some trouble teaching. He goes off on tangents often, and they are usually hilarous. If you dont care about chemistry, or if your just taking it to get an easy A, or an easy 3 credits, Take this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	211	2	2	1	5	725252	11/15/05	Seemed good for first half of the year. Then everything went downhill. He cannot teach. The class is a lecture, but may as well be online. All quizzes, tests, homeworks, lecture notes are online. He will give simple example of a problem in class and then the most challenging one in existence on the quizzes and tests. Do not take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		3	4	4	4	725252	10/18/05	Very entertaining teacher. Very knowlegeable of the topic. Gives plenty of time for tests and quizes, which are online. The exams are often MUCH harder than any problem done in class and often require alot of work. Overall a pretty good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	216	2	1	2	2	725252	10/20/07	Lectures tend to be very difficult to follow, especially on days that he goes off topic (which is quite frequently). Questions on the homeworks and exams are much more complex than examples provided in lecture. Very sarcastic, especially when people ask for his assistance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry	152	5	5	4	2	725252	6/21/07	Tries to mix it up with lectures - not always successfully. Very easy to talk to. Would take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry	208	1	1	2	3	725252	4/14/06	I took chemistry with this professor through the online section using myCourses. It was a disaster. First off yhe lectures are based on QuickTime videos that he has nothing to do with himself. Secondly, tests are often scheduled to be done in the wrong order and cover the wrong material. Week 5 quiz due before week 4, etc. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry		1	2	1	2	725252	11/28/05	I dont get this guy. In class he is a great guy, but he is a horrible teacher. On the tests/quizzes/homework, everything goes to hell. The problems are much harder and more indepth than the example problems in class or the book. The class is impossible. DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES WITH THIS TEACHER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	0	Chemistry		1	2	1	4	725252	11/15/05	Exams Very hard and near impossible questions. Starts year easy and get very confusing as time progresses. Some questions have no real answers or subject not covered. Avoid teacher at all costs!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Lanzafame	2.8	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	3	725252	10/13/05	Really funny guy, great to listen to him in lecture. Is very approachable. Also, he gave way more time than neeeded on online tests and assignments! Would highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Lardo	3.0	0	Computer Science	434	1	1	1	5	205509	4/4/08	he just didn't do it for me
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Lardo	3.0	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	NULL	205509	5/5/03	In addition to being one of RIT's finest educators, Lardo also sets a high standard in the looks department. What's sexier than an IT genius with a great smile? Nothing at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	5	192734	11/28/11	Dan is a human being, he relates to people on a real level, and if that includes coming off as arrogant and just being himself then those people are just used to the same old profs. I really loved having a real person as a professor-- great in critique, will call out everything. He has helped me out a lot as my advisor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	4	5	4	192734	1/15/09	Dan definitely does not sugar coat anything, especially when it comes to crits (which are almost always 'work in progress'. I learned a lot and worked hard, but had fun doing it too. He's an easy going guy, just do what he asks and defend your work if he questions it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	192734	4/24/08	He will not baby you. For early photo students, this might be a challenge, but he's very realistic. At the same time he's more than willing to go the extra mile and help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	192734	10/29/06	Dan is a great guy. He's easy to get along with, especially if you do what he asks of the assignments. Take his advice and you'll be fine... He's also someone you can just shoot the s**t with...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	192734	10/10/05	Dan is the best photography teacher I've ever had. He is someone who actually teaches his students. He puts in just as much effort helping and critiquing as you do in your work. He really cares about his students (current and former). I respect his opinion greatly and will go back to him even as a professional to ask for comments. He's fun and entertaining while you learn, but it's not a "boom-boom" class. Expect to work your butt off!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	3	192734	9/2/05	maybe things have changed since ive been there, but i found him very hard to communicate with, he definitely had favorites, and generally not very helpful. It sounds like a lot of people had great experiences with him, but mine was very mediocre.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	4	5	4	192734	5/2/05	He is a tough teacher, he's not afraid to let his opinion be known and sometimes can be a little arrogant. However, there is never a dull moment in his class, we always seem to be laughing and enjoying ourselves. I learned a lot in this class and am very glad that I had gotten him as a teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	192734	4/22/05	Dan is by far the best professor i have ever come across. He is very approachable, if you've having a bad day or worrying about something, he will listen and try to help. Dan will tell you the truth, he doesnt sugar coat his answers. He is not for you if you cannot take a l ittle critisism
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	1	Fine Arts		2	1	4	5	192734	2/2/09	Dan is probably the best teacher I have had at RIT and if you have the chance, try to take his class. He keeps the class upbeat and likes to befriend his students. His critiques are honest, but he will never say that a picture is "nice". He will tell you what he likes and what he doesn't like, and how to improve upon it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	4	192734	10/28/08	Dan is very arrogant and narrow minded. I found that to be a result of his own personal insecurities which he projected onto me. DO NOT get on his bad side, he will gossip about you and others will listen as he is very charismatic to his fans. Don't think he's not talking about you behind your back, he is. Oh.. he checks this site.. he told me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	2	192734	2/23/08	He is a fine art photo teacher, but when it comes to color he knows what he is talking about. If you don't mind being told the harsh truth about your photos then I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	5	192734	4/29/06	as others said, hes arrogent and has favorits. if your work is not like his he doesn't really respect it or find value in it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		3	1	3	2	192734	9/11/05	this guy was the worst...he thought he was the "godfather of color photography"...very very arrogant...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	192734	8/31/05	Dan was my advisor as well as my first photo teacher at RIT and he is one of my favorite people in the whole world. Amazing teacher who was supportive of me AND very challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	192734	7/28/05	Dan was an awesome photo one prof...but he's also the best color printer I've ever met. He's one hell of a grader. He's harsh in critique. He knows his****. He tells it like it is, and that's how it should always be. Anyone who takes Dan is smart. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	4	192734	5/2/05	Dan's class is great. you learn so much and have a**** load of fun doing it, as long as you have a sence of humor. Highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		4	3	5	5	192734	4/23/05	this is a great photo teacher that one can learn alot. he is very easy going and classes are always fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	192734	4/21/05	Dan is the best photo teacher I've ever had, and I've had quite a few elsewhere. I've learned more in a year in his class than I learned in three years with other teachers. He is an amazing professor who actually TEACHES!! He does not just leave you to learn it on your own. Highly recommended prof!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	192734	11/10/04	He can seem a bit arrogant at times but if you interact well with him it will be a pleasant experience. Was a great color photo prof (I learned a lot), sometimes a hard grader though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	192734	5/25/03	great teacher, i learned so much from him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	2	Fine Arts		2	3	4	5	192734	11/15/04	a very professional teacher. excellent use of teaching, teaching skills are impressive. drawback: personality kinks. an arranorant homosexual with an interesting background. artists wishing to do well with technology and still preserve their edge should go study with the dude.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	NULL	192734	2/2/04	He isn't an easy person to understand, and he teaches new subjects way too fast. If you want to learn something, don't take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Larkin	3.7	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	NULL	192734	4/21/03	He has his head so far up his a** it's ridiculous. The most arrogant, self-absorbed teacher I've ever met.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Latimer	5.0	2	Fine Arts	475	3	5	5	5	1187632	11/18/08	His class is incredibly useful and he genuinely cares that his students learn. Always willing to help if you come to him too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Latimer	5.0	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	1187632	10/16/08	His classes are among the most useful at RIT, and teach more than what any student expects to get out of the class. As a photo student, you can't afford to miss a chance to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	1	240782	11/13/12	She gave some of more interesting lectures out of the four professors. She seemed pretty apathetic about the studio assignments -- they were mostly just an attendance check. She grades the three projects pretty leniently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science	309	4	3	4	5	240782	10/29/11	Not a professor for those who need step-by-step instructions for how to do things. Expects you to learn basic ideas from readings, but is very helpful with questions and a fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science	101	3	5	5	5	240782	2/8/11	She was a great lecture teacher. Her assignments were very clear and easy enough. She was funny and cool. Looking at other people's reviews it may be because of the class but I liked her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	0	Computer Science	320	1	1	1	5	240782	6/8/09	This teacher is horrible. She loves WOW more than anything else in the world. She gets "sick" very often too. I did not learn much from this course because she is not good at teaching it. I took the course with another teacher, and my grade went from an F to an A. I am a very good student though. My only advice is: don't take her. She will ruin you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	0	Computer Science		4	1	2	5	240782	4/11/08	Takes forever to respond to emails. At conferences as often as she's teaching. I played Second Life each class and used Google to learn. Totally useless professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	1	Computer Science	425	3	2	4	1	240782	3/8/07	HCI1: Human Factors She seems more interested in playing WOW than teaching the material she pulls out of nowhere. She expects A LOT from her students, and it shows in the grading. 3 group projects and 1 individual project. Also a bunch of reading and some other HW. She said she doesn't care what kind of reviews she gets. She's already tenured.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	5	240782	2/23/07	For IT students...this class is a bit of a joke. She is a reasonable lady who does hold people to high expectations. Her website was a bit of a pain in the ass and she is kind of sneaky about assigning work. (i.e. she will put it up and not mention it to anyone). She did teach me some things that i didn't know, but, her grading seemed a little off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	1	Computer Science	320	3	2	3	2	240782	11/12/06	Not interesting at all, and pretty mean at times. Just not a pleasant person, and not really helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science	320	2	5	5	NULL	240782	4/27/04	She rocks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science	101	4	4	3	2	240782	11/9/11	Had her for Intro to Interactive Media. Her lectures were more interesting than the other professors, but the studio work is fairly difficult. You need to learn a lot of stuff on your own. I thought the 3 projects were easy and she graded them easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	0	Computer Science	309	1	1	1	4	240782	4/18/11	dont take her. all she will do is tell you to read how to make websites online and unless you know how and just need this class... find another professor this is the worst class i've ever taken
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	1	240782	5/18/10	Teaches from her horribly designed website then criticizes your work because it isn't pretty enough. Too critical about assignments, THIS IS A INTRO CLASS. Takes WAY too long to grade and promises things if she doesn't get them done on time, then takes it back. Has her son grade projects. Awful!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	1	Computer Science		3	2	4	2	240782	4/27/08	Lawley taught herself how to make websites and she expects you to teach yourself as well. She gives some minor directional help (she showed us some websites), but doesn't actually teach you anything. Assigns readings and vague exercises, expects you to learn from those. Only take if you like teachers who don't involve themselves in your learning.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	4	240782	12/3/07	fairly decent teacher overall. she does come across as mean at times. i didnt like how homework went towards your grade, yet she never told you when homework was even posted. you were just expected to always be looking at mycourses.this class would have certainly been harder had i not had prior expierince. dont take this class if your new to IT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	1	Computer Science	320	3	3	2	2	240782	2/25/07	She expected u to learn purely from the textbooks given. Some of her methods seemed a bit old-fashioned compared to the other IMM teachers. She wasn't too friendly and expected you to teach yourself most of the time. If you take her class without any prior knowledge to the subject, you'll be totally lost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science	737	4	3	4	5	240782	11/13/06	She is OK. Knows a lot about a little but very little about a lot. Don't look to increase you web knowledge too much in her class. She is not very nice either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	1	240782	9/19/05	Couldn't stand her. Many of just sat in the back of the class and spent lots of time doing the projects that she assigned to us in class. Library Science PHD teaching web design courses: You do the math... or english :-(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Lawley	3.1	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	NULL	240782	8/21/03	Professor Lawley is one of those teachers who won't let you slack off. She demands quality and you'll want to deliver. She will also teach you a few life lessons along the way. It's comforting to know that there are still teachers out there who care...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Lawlor	3.7	1	Business		5	3	3	3	759015	5/29/09	omg so boring. just talks off of his powerpoints and goes off on tangents about netflix. at the same time, you have to go to class because he talks about stuff on the test that's not in the book. very easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Lawlor	3.7	2	Business		4	4	4	2	759015	2/16/06	Good teacher, kinda boring but very willing to help. Plus he takes you all out to the bar after the class is over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Lawlor	3.7	0	Business		1	1	1	4	759015	11/17/05	He tends to give out his students guides for exams in a last min. He also likes to trick someone on a final exam. What an unfair... Not recommend to anyone to take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Lawlor	3.7	2	Business	250	4	5	5	3	759015	11/20/06	marty lectured a lot straight from power point. He's a cool guy if you get to know him. His essay portions of the test were graded real easy. He also graded the big paper we had due rather easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marty Lawlor	3.7	2	Business		5	5	5	5	759015	11/17/05	Very easy course, just read the book and he will give you the guidence. Easy "A". He takes his students out to bar for a drink. A++++ professor.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecile Lawrence	1.2	0	Philosophy	202	1	1	1	2	1407906	4/23/10	Terrible teacher, avoid at all cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cecile Lawrence	1.2	0	Philosophy	211	2	2	1	1	1407906	2/22/10	Worst professor ever!!!! Do not take her class. Her hand writing sucks and she is horrible at grading work on a timely basis and horrible at uploading items on time. She is computer illiterate. Lectures are super boring and uninteresting. She offers no help what so ever. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg  Lawson	1.0	0	Freshman Year Experience		5	1	1	1	1794514	1/24/13	As if these classes weren't boring enough, Greg just makes it even more dull. He seems to be a nice guy, but as a FYE teacher, he stinks. However, he grades pretty easily. It's a 50/50 shot with this one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Le Blévec	4.5	2	French	103	4	5	3	4	1694326	12/23/12	Would probably be a better teacher without the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Le Blévec	4.5	2	French	442	2	5	4	4	1694326	2/15/12	Strict, but willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Le Blévec	4.5	2	French	101	1	5	5	5	1694326	6/1/12	Extra
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Lee	4.5	2	Engineering		2	5	4	4	1598347	10/26/11	Took him for Thermo. Excellent professor. Explains everything well and is ALWAYS open for questions. He writes a little fast on the board and his tests are a little difficult. He wants you to succeed but he doesn't just hand it to you. Really nice guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Lee	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1598347	7/12/11	Had him for statics lab, strength of materials and mech design. He encourages students to ask questions and he tries to answer them as best he can. Go to class, do your homework or you won't understand a thing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		4	3	5	5	195906	1/29/13	She is awesome!I think she's great and very sweet. Most language teachers are awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	195906	1/27/12	Lee-Sensee is the best possible teacher for Beginning Japanese I! She is very friendly and approachable, and makes class fun and relaxed while still giving us lots of work. Don't slack off and you will enjoy her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	195906	7/2/10	I like Lee sensee. She prepares even all details of her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		4	3	4	5	195906	5/1/05	That dude up top rated the wrong teacher? anyways...She talks fast and you better write fast. Overall, she is a good teacher and she passes out practice tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages	101	5	4	4	3	195906	1/8/13	Lee-sensei is a great Japanese teacher! She explains grammar in an easily understandable manner, and creates a relaxed atmosphere where students are free to ask questions. You have to memorize hiragana and katakana, but she goes through the characters often and gives plenty of opportunities to practice. Her exams are very easy, and I recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		4	5	4	5	195906	11/9/11	Very nice, always makes herself available for extra help. She's really lenient on pronunciation, and doesn't assign much homework. She's an awesome Japanese Professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		4	5	4	5	195906	5/23/07	I loved Lee Sensee! She made sure everything was clear and was very funny and nice. We had a lot of fun in our class that quarter. I'd recommend her. Workload is doable, but lots of memorization (obviously). If you work hard, you can get an A, just don't slack!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Miho Lee	4.4	2	Languages		4	5	5	NULL	195906	4/24/03	Great teacher...talks fast but work load is doable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	1	Engineering		2	3	2	2	1690920	4/8/13	She is not a professor I would recommend to anyone. She always seems to be unsure of what she is doing. Gives impossible questions on the test and thinks she has prepared you well for the test but apparently she has not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	2	Engineering		3	3	4	4	1690920	1/28/13	Goes through a lot of the material quickly and it can be hard to keep up in class if you didn't do the preparations before class. When she's there she's pretty helpful but when her kid gets sick (which is often) she won't be available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	1	Engineering	214	2	3	2	4	1690920	12/19/12	She teaches by going really fast through slides. When we're supposed to work along in Creo, she goes really fast so it's impossible to keep up if you don't have previous CAD experience. She is a nice person though (but a really tough grader).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	2	Engineering		2	4	3	4	1690920	2/17/12	She is very picky about how you create the part in creo. You have to do it exactly as she wants or you lose points, even if the part is correct and fully functional. She will help you and occasionally gives in-class time to do projects otherwise to be completed outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	0	Engineering		2	2	2	4	1690920	3/28/13	She tries to prepare you for tests with harder HW problems and in class problems only to give you impossible test questions that you're not prepared for. She's nice enough but she mumbles in class a lot and stumbles on her words. She's the best in her office hours and tries to help in any way she can but not the best in the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	1690920	1/14/13	Good professor, helpful if you try to seem interested in the topic. Has a comprehensive knowledge base of the topics she teaches after the first time teaching the course. Has a cute kid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	2	Engineering		3	4	4	5	1690920	2/23/12	I had her for both Materials Processing and Engineering Design Graphic. For Materials Processing we did not use the textbook other than reading and it was really too easy. EDG on the other hand was tough. It is her area, she is a stickler for details and will take off points to make sure that you complete your drawings and assemblies correctly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Leipold	3.1	0	Engineering		3	2	2	1	1690920	2/1/12	She's very boring.She tries to make it interesting but I cant help but fall asleep. She's not very clear and doesn't seem to know the material well. She speeds through all the slides.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	0	Fine Arts		4	2	1	3	1250764	12/11/12	Somewhat easy class when you figure out what the teacher wants. Just be as anti-men, as possible in all your essays and articles. In addition, try to under analyze as much as possible and make as many poor assumptions as you can think of. Also, write as elementary as possible. The A is easy if you write like a fourth grader. I am being serious btw
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	1250764	4/4/11	I took this class as a senior cause I thought itd be fun & easy for my last quarter at RIT. Well its NOT easy (8-12p research paper AHH) but it is a lot of fun and very interesting. She really seems to know what she's talking about, she's a good prof. I would recommend this class to anyone sincerely interested in the material, this is not an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	4	4	1250764	3/1/10	Tina is a great teacher...keeps things interestnig and understandable. She is hard, and her courses are a lot of reading, but they are fair and she grades fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	1	Fine Arts	467	2	2	4	5	1250764	1/28/09	I was expecting a very interesting class and instead got stuck with a professor who does not shut up! she doesn't even take a break, assigns so much reading, and an 8-12 research paper! the midterm was impossible to finish, as it was 2 essays to be completed in an hour! she focuses on the historical context of film rather than film, do not take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	2	Fine Arts	480	2	5	5	4	1250764	4/20/11	Dr. Lent's Women/Gender/Art class was incredibly interesting and well-planned. She's very knowledgeable about the subject of women as subject and creator in the art world. I was already interested in the subject, but she is the reason that the class was so worthwhile. If you get the chance to take any of her classes, do it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	2	Fine Arts		3	3	4	4	1250764	11/30/10	Assigns a lot of reading and you have to write one-page summaries for most of the articles. Also have field trip journals and a research paper, both written and oral presentation. She is a nice teacher and she does grade fair - you get what you deserve. However, the downside is that she TALKS for the whole class and there are no breaks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Lent	3.9	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	4	1250764	10/21/09	This is NOT an easy A. She makes you work for it in order to get a good grade. This class involved a heavy reading and writing load but has kept me on track and lead to me learning and retaining more information than many other classes. She cares about the material and though lectures can become a little dry, it is up to you to start discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffery Lasky	2.8	2	Information Technology	201	5	4	5	3	916649	10/18/11	Was a fine Freshman Seminar professor. Talked about some interesting things, and let us talk about things ourselves. Only homework was few-sentence discussion posting regarding our RIT experience weekly, and a paper at the end. Paper was not research, only speculation (no sources/MLA required).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffery Lasky	2.8	1	Information Technology	882	2	3	2	3	916649	4/27/09	I have never seen anyone get over a B in this enterprise security class. The class is more business but he seems to have little technological experience for a technology major.He did help me out due to misunderstandings, but with much hesitance. Would avoid if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffery Lasky	2.8	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	4	916649	8/5/09	Well... I have mixed feelings about this class... I got an A... so the first poster is wrong. He is a good lecturer but I think I was looking for something a little more technical in an enterprise security class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffery Lasky	2.8	0	Information Technology	718	1	1	1	3	916649	11/13/06	Worst Professor I ever had. Did nothing. Made us write 4 papers and never gave any feedback on what we did wrong or how to improve. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! This guy doesn't deserve to work in IT let along teach in IT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History	485	5	5	4	3	1277435	11/12/12	Laid back and reasonable. Entertaining classes with good opportunity for discussion if anyone felt like discussing anything. Easy to ask questions. Relatively few assignments and grades with excellent, timely, feedback. Would recommend taking his classes at every opportunity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History		5	4	4	4	1277435	6/12/11	Very interesting lectures. Tests and quizzes are all essays and defining terms (usually 2 out of 10 given). Grading is so ridiculously easy that if you have any idea what the answer is you will get full credit. If you want an easy A but at the same time have a very interesting course to fill your electives, take a class with Laver.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History	485	4	4	5	4	1277435	3/8/10	Probably one of the most chill professors ever. Grading is ridiculously easy; if you fail his class... I don't even know. And I think his lectures were really good, it was less of a lecture and more relaying a really good story, so it kept me interested. Just pay attention and read (even just skim) the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History	485	4	4	5	4	1277435	11/9/11	Had him for Asian Civilization, pretty easy as long as you read the book and pay attention in class. Need to write two papers, both 2 pages, double-space super easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History	325	4	5	5	3	1277435	11/13/10	A pretty good professor who spends each class lecturing. The lectures are interesting, and if you pay attention and take notes it can take the place of the main textbook. There are supplemental readings, but are only used for the quizzes. The quizzes and exams are all essay writing, but you know what they will cover ahead of time and the grading is
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Laver	4.4	2	History	280	5	4	4	3	1277435	10/19/09	Really good professor! He is a bit boring in class and his lectures sometimes seem long but his quizzes and tests are not difficult at all. He is a pretty easy grader and does not reall care if you never show up and stuff like that. Although if you want his help at some point in the year you will have to show some interest and have decent attendanc
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Lawlor	4.5	2	Science	301	2	5	4	4	720697	2/2/11	A very kind man, always willing to help. Attend class - his lectures are vital and everything covered WILL be on the exam. Very comprehensive, but surprisingly good at helping you understand the material. Not the most enthralling, but he makes up for it with his light humor.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin  Lawrance	2.0	0	History		1	2	2	3	1799802	2/28/13	He is very rude and hard professor. He gives a lot of assignments which are time consuming. Midterm and final examinations are long papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Lawrence	4.8	2	Accounting		4	5	5	5	660662	2/22/13	Old-fashioned, organized, calm. Makes mild jokes. Most of the notes are straight from the textbook. Nothing will happen to surprise you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Lawrence	4.8	2	Accounting		2	5	5	5	660662	3/17/06	Excellent teacher. Interested in teaching and learning. Consistent, fair, professional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Lawrence	4.8	2	Accounting	621	2	4	5	4	660662	4/22/08	Very fair, very organized. Knows the material. Really should be math professor not stats professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Lazarski	4.7	2	Design	216	4	5	5	4	1100702	6/2/11	I had him for Vector Imaging last year. He was a great teacher and explained things well... I thank him for my skills in Illustrator!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Lazarski	4.7	2	Design		4	5	5	4	1100702	2/4/08	Peter is new to teaching but does it very well. He knows what he's talking about and always willing to help if you have a question. Also very easy on the eyes. *wink*
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Lazarski	4.7	2	Design	216	5	4	4	2	1100702	9/17/10	The class is easy, but pretty long and boring. You basically just do tutorials during class and your projects are based on what you've learned. thank god we worked on computers and had access to the internet. If you don't understand something, ask, he'll try to explain it better and make sure you understand it and learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics		4	4	4	3	816765	4/14/10	has an accent but makes jokes. nice guy. easy to get a good grade if u just read his packet
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		3	2	2	1	816765	2/18/10	If you memorize his packet, you're not getting a bad grade. An A is not assured either, though. He doesn't speak clearly and he is not the best grader I've seen. If you can avoid him, do so. If not, then work on your memorization.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics		4	5	4	5	816765	11/20/09	I took Intro to Int'l Relations with him and enjoyed every single lecture. He is well organized and makes your life organized and easy by preparing a comprehensive handout that covers all the topics. I really enjoyed his lectures. He has a solid educational background; econs, politics and theology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		5	2	2	2	816765	9/29/09	he is not a good professor at all. dont expect you can learn from him, he doesnt know any thing but just read from his papers. he doest want to help you at all if you are absent for some reason. He wants you to ask your friends instead of him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics	402	3	3	4	3	816765	1/30/09	Spend a Half hour or so on each page of his packet and write an essay based on the info. Don't expect to get away with any less than that. Basically write 18(out of 42) short essays with detailed graphs and then randomly pick 2/3 at random on test days. Very helpful and Reasonable. Good Luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics	511	2	1	1	2	816765	2/7/08	Very unfair class. Class is extremely boring and he lectures the entire time. He only gives about two or three tests and they are all based on memorization. Not helpful what so ever. I was very, very disappointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		2	1	2	3	816765	4/24/07	Literally hands a packet out the first day of class, and expects you to memorize. Incredibly boring classes as he just reads from notes. For the only grades, he gives 3 tests and literally wants you to copy exactly whats on his notes. If you are good at memorization, this is the class for you. Otherwise, avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics		2	3	5	1	816765	11/29/06	He explains topics very well, but his tests are based on memorization. My grades definately do not reflect my understanding. He gives out a packet of notes for the class and teaches out of it. Blindly memorize as much as you can and spit it out on paper. If you can do that you'll be fine. You don't really have to pay attention much.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics	101	5	5	3	3	816765	2/19/10	As long as you listen to his lectures and review his packet, you should get at least a B. I got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics	402	3	1	1	1	816765	2/11/10	By far the worst professor at RIT. hands out a packet on day one, expects you to regurgitate every word for the tests, and has no grading system. I got sick, had a doctors excuse, and still refused to work with me. Missed a lot of class, and he gave me the run around in week 8 and 9 hasseling me to withdraw. Avoid this professor at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics	101	5	5	5	5	816765	10/6/09	The only people that complain about this professor are people who don't care. Easy A class. Study the text and you're golden. Interesting topics, and obvious intellectual teaching them. Unbiased towards everyone. Very straightforward class, just do some studying and don't complain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics	101	3	1	1	4	816765	5/25/09	Terrible. Example: "The Cold war is US vs Russia." Doesn't ever read the term paper, grades with favoritism, extremely boring. What more can I say? Avoid taking classes with him if you want to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	2	Economics	211	5	4	5	5	816765	9/6/08	Memorize the handout he gives in the beginning of the class and spit it out during the exam. He lets you know the questions on the test a week in advance. Does not cover all the materials you will need for later economics classes, but if you are an engineering major trying to finish Liberal Arts requirements, this is the way to go.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		2	1	1	4	816765	10/29/07	Worst teacher at RIT. Lectures are incomprehensible, Speaks with an accent, has a throat problem making it impossible to understand him.On the first day of class he hands out a packet written in broken English and expects you tom memorize and regurgitate it in the form of essays on his three tests. Lectures are him reading directly from his packet
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	1	Economics		4	2	4	1	816765	3/7/07	Same thoughts as the previous rater. good lectures, terrible grading system-He doesn't have one. Exams will be in essay form, just memorize as blindly as you can, you don't even have to know what they mean, he doesn't care if you know. Your ability to memorize is proof to this guy that you know the materials. I dont recommend taking his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		3	2	1	4	816765	10/19/06	Hard to understand, not very involved. Basically teach yourself kind of course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hoyoung Lee	2.8	0	Economics		3	2	2	3	816765	3/3/06	he knew what he was talking about, but it was very hard to understand him. his tests were choose 2/3 essays. The only way you pass the test is if you have all the graphs and tables from his notes momorized and in the booklet. If you are able to get that, you should do okay, but dont expect to get much out of the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		2	1	1	1	914398	11/9/11	Lee is a very smart man, but he is not good at conveying information. His accent makes him difficult to understand and when he tries to answer questions, he ends up contradicting himself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		1	2	2	5	914398	11/28/10	He speaks with a funny accent so it's a little hard to understand him. He also contradicts himself at times. His tests are highly opinion based, so its his way or a lovely F. So pay attention to his words and you'll be golden. Not that easy of an A. :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	2	Communication	482	3	5	3	4	914398	10/15/08	Had him a few times, and just like the others I would say that if you can get past his thick accent you'll learn a TON. This guy knows his stuff and will spend as much time after class helping you understand. One of the better Prof's in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		3	2	2	4	914398	10/20/07	no....just no.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		3	2	2	4	914398	2/27/07	not great at teaching. didn't really learn anything. ehh...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		1	1	1	3	914398	11/9/06	Horrible, BORING teacher, learned absolutely NOTHING. He is a new prof. who does not know much of anything. You cannot understand him and he will test you on things that are not in the book or in lectures. The average test grade is 60%. If you ask him a question normally he will not respond or he will ask you the same question you just asked him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	1	Communication		3	3	2	3	914398	1/25/11	Very boring teacher. You're better off learning from the book. Presentation criteria is nearly impossible to satisfy him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	1	Communication		3	3	2	4	914398	12/2/08	Professor Lee is not clear about most of what he wants in the course and very very very - I can't repeated enough - very boring. His tests are easy multiple choice and True/False questions. However, the group project is really tough. If you don't have other options, it should be on your list...but if you have other options...DON'T TAKE the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	2	Communication	535	2	5	3	4	914398	7/3/08	If you can understand him, you'll learn so much. He's a brilliant guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	0	Communication		3	2	2	3	914398	10/18/07	Hard to understand. Doesnt really understand english too well, when I ask him questions he stares at me like I'm an alien, and the just says something irrevelant. Overall grade so far is good. Textbook is useless. Just go by his lecture notes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ki-Young Lee	2.5	2	Communication		4	5	4	2	914398	1/31/07	Persuasion with him was not bad. He made it interesting (as interesting as it can be). He was helpful and his assignments were clear. The test were fair and he provided sample questions and study guides. He can be hard to understand, but he does make an effort to be clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Lehmann	5.0	2	English		5	5	5	5	475155	9/3/05	By far the most real and down to earth prof I've ever had at that god-forsaken school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Lehmann	5.0	2	English		5	5	5	4	475155	10/19/04	who doesnt like a guy that talks about all the crimes in Rochester!!! a definete must have!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		3	4	3	2	487901	1/28/13	She's nice and answers any questions. I am not sure how she can come across as rude. The class ain't no cakewalk, meaning you do have to study the handouts. If you rush through class though you can still leave in like an 45 minutes though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	1	Science		3	3	3	3	487901	11/20/11	Mediocre. Stuck to syllabus, but class wasn't very engaging. Sometimes she came across very rude. Assignments are very straightforward.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		1	4	3	2	487901	12/18/09	Kind of boring. Sometimes she talks too much. She gives out weekly quizzes but they are very hard because you have to remember so many new words and the quizzes only ask a few questions so it makes it harder what you really need to know for the quizzes. The teacher doesn't really cover everything, she tells you to go learn on your own time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		3	4	4	2	487901	11/20/05	GOod teacher, was very hands on and kept the class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	1	Science		3	2	4	3	487901	11/2/12	Boring teacher, quizzes are vague, seems rude a lot of the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		3	5	5	5	487901	5/30/11	She is very thorough and is genuinely concerned that you do well! There is a lot of material to study for the weekly quizzes - I HIGHLY recommend doing flashcards; they served me very very well. Take advantage of her office hours and she will help "guide" your studying! Interesting lectures and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		4	4	4	3	487901	10/12/06	Rather boring because you have to sit through a mini lecture when you just want to get to the point, do the work, and get out. Manuals are nessecary if you want to study and get A's on the quizes. She gives you the important materials on handouts if you forget/don't have the manual. Most annoying aspect is she doesn't come 1/2 the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michele Lennox	3.7	2	Science		2	3	4	5	487901	11/5/04	ehh.. wasnt to pleased
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	2	Computer Science	218	5	5	5	4	38875	2/24/12	Great professor. Not much to say about him. He'll teach you Java.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	2	Computer Science	217	4	4	5	4	38875	1/29/12	Good professor for a beginning programming class. Manages to keep lectures interesting while staying on-topic. Instruction is clear and well-paced.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	0	Computer Science	217	3	1	3	3	38875	11/29/10	This professor makes you learn on your own. He teaches very quickly and only goes over slides. Slides that he does skip over for time sake are very important to your success. Information on the slides are all on the tests. Overall if you want to teach yourself at a 42,000 dollar a year university be my guest, if you actually want to learn... Don't!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	1	Computer Science		2	5	1	1	38875	9/19/05	The man speaks in tongues and can't seam to bring an example that works. But he does care and great deal... he's just too far out in his own world to convey information understandably.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	1	Computer Science	516	3	3	2	NULL	38875	12/20/02	Notes incorrect. Corrected by students. Doesn't know material REAL well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	5	38875	2/22/12	Fair Professor. He does OK job on lectures. His homework and lab work is not clear. Sometimes I wonder if the professor is taking the complicated approach to make the program to work while there are a quicker and simpler approach. But he helped me to understand Java Programming well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	3	2	38875	9/12/11	Prof Leone is a really nice guy. He makes alot of mistakes on his powerpoints but he will fix them if there wrong. Hes a great teacher and will try to get you out of class early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	2	2	1	38875	1/8/08	pure garbage in every aspect
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	NULL	38875	2/19/03	Teching about networking Requires knowledge on networking. He is a fencepost!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Leone	2.8	0	Computer Science	522	3	1	1	NULL	38875	3/20/02	Doesn't know code from a hole in the ground.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	0	Business	104	1	1	2	2	796456	5/30/12	he does not help you and on top of that he gives you bad grades. he's a bad professor who doesn't care about the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	0	Business		1	2	2	5	796456	11/17/11	Strange unprofessional ramblings dominate the vast majority of class time. I did not learn anything from the lectures other than why Obama is a Socialist. The textbook was decent but not followed closely enough. Don't expect an "A" unless you already have a degree in finance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	2	Business	722	1	3	5	4	796456	4/20/09	Prof.Lessard is a strange case.However,most importantly,attending his class is the best thing you can do for your finance career cuz he is so good with the subject.He is the best finance professor at mediocre Saunders College.Things he said actually came up in my real world practice as a Finance Manager.Negatives-doesn't care about students AT ALL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	2	Business		2	5	2	1	796456	1/28/08	Dont waste your time reading the book. Just copy everything he says and MEMORIZE them. I guarantee you will get an A by rewriting everything he did on the board on the exams. He might act like a jerk in class but he is really helpful and nice if you see him in his office.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	2	Business	725	1	5	4	4	796456	5/6/12	The hardest professor in the college. If you want to really learn material take him. Knows his stuff and makes you learn it. His classes helped me pass CFA levels I & II. He uses a lot of group projects in class and he selects who is on the teams randomly. Get on a bad team and grade is severely impacted. The same in all his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	1	Business		1	2	3	1	796456	3/1/10	Horrible professor. Had 2 projects which he didn't explain at all. Tests were hard and did not cover the material that was covered in class OR the book, and he went ahead and was too lazy to grade the final exam, which might have brought my grade up. Instead I ended up with a 79.6 and he didn't round up!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Lessard	2.2	0	Business		1	2	2	3	796456	5/19/08	Lessard is the only aspect of my education at RIT that I disliked. I took 4 Lessard classes due to my finance concentration and hated every one of them..If you can help it... do NOT take anything with him.. I'd strongly strongly advise against it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	2	Accounting		4	4	4	4	1630333	5/1/12	Great teacher, accent a little difficult to understand at first but you get used to it within the first week or two. Very straight forward class, he makes it possible to obtain an A. quizzes are easy enough, and exams are manageable so long as you study a little for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	2	Accounting		5	5	4	4	1630333	11/20/11	good prof, easy if you study. note sheet is so helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	2	Accounting	201	3	5	4	5	1630333	11/6/11	He is a great professor for A students, and always asking challenging questions in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	0	Accounting		2	1	1	1	1630333	10/24/11	Very difficult to understand, even when asked to clarify or reiterate statements. Gives you a copy of the slides, but they're not very helpful (I ended up going thru my book for almost every ch.) He allows you a double-sided sheet of notes on the tests, but then has RIDICULOUSLY hard T/F questions. Lots of out-of-class studying is recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	2	Accounting	301	3	5	5	4	1630333	2/22/12	Professor Li is awesome! He is really knowledgeable and always has answers for any questions you ask. He goes out of his way to help students and wants them to succeed. Take him if you can as he will only be at RIT for a short time. Anyone who says he is hard to understand simply does not care enough about the class to pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	1	Accounting	302	2	5	1	2	1630333	11/9/11	Even though he let you use a note sheet during the exam, the exams were very hard. I received a good great in course but, I had to work really hard to get that grade. Hours and hours of going through the book because I didn't understand him or his power points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lingxiang Li	3.8	2	Accounting		4	5	4	4	1630333	11/6/11	MGMT ACCT. He is always available. Trying to cover stuff a little bit difficult for non-business majors in class though. Exams are OK in terms of difficulty.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	3	903828	11/18/12	She's very helpful and is more interested in a students learning than anything else. She provides time and extra help if needed and is a very genuine, caring Prof. Readings are interesting, 2presentations (1 is small) and a short 1-3 page paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	903828	11/10/11	Amazing class, amazing professor. Blunt, funny, clear. Reasonable assignments, understanding of your needs, values class opinions and participation. Provides insight into complex and interesting topics. Expects you to try.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	3	903828	10/10/07	Fun teacher. Makes you want to go to class. Few tests and quizzes, and plenty of opportunity's for extra credit. a couple of papers but they aren't bad. There is no reason for you not to get an A if you want one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	903828	10/23/06	Perhaps the greatest teacher here! In her classes you actually learn something new and important. Your personal opinions are not just valued but loved. She's no stranger to thinking outside the box and making her students ask deep questions. If you want to learn, really learn, take her classes!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	3	2	903828	12/14/11	ImagINing Rochester. For me her lack of organization and lack of clarity on assignments and things caused some problems. Didn't know the point of the class most of the time, though I did enjoy it. Not a ton of work though, and teaches interesting subjects, so take if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	5	5	903828	10/29/08	She is fabulous! She is upbeat and positive and will inspire the heck out of you. And she's extremely enthusiastic about her subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Lieberman	4.7	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	903828	9/21/07	amazing. very interesting and thought provoking classes. wants us to learn, not be taught. very fun and a great sense of humor. atypical of professors. overall - excellent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	1	Fine Arts		5	3	3	1	403328	12/28/10	I've taken numerous classes with Jay. Interesting Character. He's rare in the sense that he takes the time to write a detailed syllabus with assignments and specific requirements. Be prepared to stay in any class for at least 4 of the five hours, Jay likes to incorporate "exercises" in class to fill as much time as possible. Oh, Jay...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	5	403328	3/9/10	I am more interested in caricature than any other illustration. Any time a student has a focused interest going into a class, it's likely to work out great, or clash with the instructor. Jay did a great job not only keeping my interest but fanning it and focusing it. I am a much improved artist for taking this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	1	Fine Arts		3	3	3	4	403328	10/17/06	I have taken atleast three classes with Jay and I will be taking more. Honestly I have leared a lot from him, which seems like it would be hard to do. Three classes... the same lesson over and over and over... He's an awesome guy, a great illustrator, I rarely understand what he's talking about, but the classes are fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	403328	8/31/05	Jay is great at introducing new mediums to use and his demonstrations are more than helpful. The projects are always very interesting and enjoyable and he grades fairly. To be honest, I think I've learned more from him than any other professor at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	403328	7/2/04	Actually gets ideas from books and researches his material. Demostrations are helpful and he grades on whether your project is good or not, not your effort. Recommended for those who have skill.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	5	403328	5/20/10	Caricature 2 really frees you up. Jay doesn't really care that much what kind of stuff you do as long as it's good and you're passionate about it. A good Caricature Personal Focus class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	5	5	403328	10/16/08	Jay may talk slow and keep you all class, but it's worth it. He's a great prof, you will learn a lot, and he has a very interesting sense of humor if you can find it. Plus, he's an incredibly talented artist in his own right. RIT is lucky to have him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	403328	10/28/05	so much fun, any class with jay is awesome. Jay has such an amazing skill and can teach you so much. He finds ways of making his class more enjoyable like taking class trips to the zoo for inspiration or just talking about the most random stuff while you work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	4	403328	3/6/05	Jay tends to be very repetitive in his lessons, using the same exercises in multiple classes. But he is very friendly and helpful when discussing work, and as someone else mentioned, he actually grades based on talent, not on whether or not you can just finish the project. Thumbs up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jay Lincoln	4.1	1	Fine Arts		4	2	3	NULL	403328	5/6/04	It's always the same. Different class, same stuff. He only teaches his way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	2	Engineering		2	4	4	3	552876	6/3/12	Professor treats you like you are at a job in real life which some students dislike but is it is realistic. If you are willing to work hard and ask questions then you will learn a lot. This Professor is extremely knowledgeable and I would recommend to anybody taking this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	0	Engineering		1	1	2	1	552876	8/15/09	Avoid taking ANY course with this man. He has ridculous strict standards, doesn't help especially those failing, doesn't return work & tell you what you got wrong,expects you to already know the answers, and plays favorites & non-favorites. If ever met with having to take a class with him, wait for another professor to teach the course next time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	0	Engineering		2	1	2	4	552876	2/9/06	He is not very professional or effective. I do not recommend this professor!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	2	Engineering	618	3	4	4	3	552876	3/8/12	*note: DSD is one of the hardest classes regardless of your instructor. Prof Link is very strict, which some students prefer versus a teacher who changes due dates and assignments frequently. Very knowledgeable in VHDL, and will help you if he can see that you are trying. If you work hard you will pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	2	Engineering		2	3	4	2	552876	3/2/09	Tough class but I learned a lot. He is a fair grader and good at returning work promptly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Link	2.8	0	Engineering		3	1	3	5	552876	1/11/05	I would not recommend taking any class with this professor. I feel that he is not an effective professor nor is he professional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	0	Anthropology		5	1	1	4	770066	8/8/10	Homework is always a short paper and readings are excessively long. She is well meaning but is completely unable to run a discussion, always posing rhetorical questions and making awkward comments that bring conversation to a dead halt. Easy A if you know what she wants to hear and can tolerate her incomprehensible rambling for 10 weeks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	2	Anthropology	420	5	4	4	4	770066	2/3/09	Uli might be my favorite professor at RIT. If you can read articles and think critically, you can get an A. Ive gotten A's in every class ive had with her and she is a lot of fun! Try to get her to throw a party at the end of the quarter, ive been trying for like 3 years now!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	2	Anthropology		4	5	4	3	770066	5/21/07	Linke is crazy in a good way. Her class always follows this format, Step 1:read a 5-10 page article, write 1 page summary/reflection, go to class, watch video or discuss said article. Repeat all qaurter. Step 2:??? Step:Profit/A. If you cant pass a Linke class you just should give up, theres still plenty help need on front end bagging at weggy's
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	2	Anthropology		5	4	3	4	770066	11/6/06	bodies and culture class- extremely easy. No book, just articles. No tests, just skim the articles enough to make a 1 page response and you're fine. Very easy grader. So basically, if you dont feel like buying a book or having to worry about a grade, take this class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	1	Anthropology		5	3	3	1	770066	12/2/05	Easiest Class i've ever taken
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	2	Anthropology		5	4	4	3	770066	11/14/09	Linke is a pretty easy teacher. You get extra credit just for going to class! Her three exams are really simple, and you don't really need to study if you have common sense. Do the homework readings and summaries, and review the powerpoints, and this class is an easy GPA booster.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	1	Anthropology		4	3	3	4	770066	10/21/07	This class was pretty easy. The tests are multiple choice and short answer based around discussions in class, which is mostly general knowledge and common sense type stuff. All her lectures are on powerpoints that she posts on mycourses. If you need an easy A and need to fulfill a liberal arts requirement, then take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	0	Anthropology	373	2	1	1	3	770066	2/26/07	Worst professor ever  not only can you not understand her english, she grades you on it...in your papers that you have to write for EVERY CLASS (no, im not kidding). What a huge waste of time, and for a crappy grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Uli Linke	3.0	1	Anthropology		3	3	3	3	770066	10/25/06	A nice, fairly easy professor. We covered some generally interesting issues in class, but it wasn't quite what I expected (the class was more a focused topic than general information).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manlu Liu	4.0	1	Business	345	5	1	4	5	1706994	12/6/12	Good teacher but very unhelpful. I missed one class/test and she would not allow a make up. I performed at the top of the class but ended up with a C because I received a 0 for one of two exams. She is a good teacher, but DO NOT miss an exam or you will pay. She will not work with you to arrange things if you have schedule conflict!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manlu Liu	4.0	2	Business	340	2	5	5	4	1706994	4/6/12	The BEST teacher at RIT. She may seem hard on the outside, but she is extremely intelligent and dedicated. Her lectures are very structured and clear, she always encourages student participation to aid in learning. Her utmost concern is that students learn! As long as you pay attention, you will actually end up loving the class and learning a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manlu Liu	4.0	2	Business		2	5	4	4	1706994	8/16/12	Prof. Liu is very kind and dedicated to teaching. She does a great job explaining parts of the DBMS. Sometimes she can over explain some things and that can get kind of boring but... most of the time, this class is lots of new material at a VERY manageable pace.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	1	Engineering		2	3	2	5	475156	3/5/12	Product Design is his forte, take it if you can. His expectations are remarkably low compared to every other course he teaches, which means when things inevitably go wrong you're still well on your way to a good grade as long as you can explain why it went wrong & what you would've done if it hadn't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	475156	5/30/10	He is a cool man, but when it comes to learning the material, he is absolutely garbage! I really do question how great he is as a professor because I feel that he isn't qualified. He is one of the head department chair in CAST so beware when you criticize him. He is better than Slifka, so I recommend taking him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	0	Engineering	403	1	1	1	1	475156	5/18/09	Worst professor at RIT. I learned absolutely nothing in my Failure Mechanics class. His exams are bogus and they are 40% of your grade. Doesn't clearly tell you what is on the exam. One of the worst professors at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	2	Engineering		5	5	4	3	475156	9/3/07	knows his stuff. sometimes depends on TA's too much and is a very easy grader. Take him for topics like product development, and avoid him for real classes like failure mechanics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	475156	10/19/04	What a great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	2	Engineering		4	3	4	5	475156	11/10/11	fair grading, sometimes it seems like hes out to trick you... but you learn from it. if he is unclear, just ask and he will make sure you understand it however necessary. he may throw you off on a tangent just to get you thinking but its all for a reason. i can see why some may not understand his style.. but he is a great resource.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	1	Engineering		2	3	3	2	475156	11/9/09	Very willing to converse with anyone on random subjects, but slow to actually teach material. Assigns quarter-long project & only gives general directions when necessary, expecting you to "network" & figure it out for yourselves. Unclear what would be on exams; was surprised to find out a question he thought was a "gimme" half the class missed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	0	Engineering	403	2	2	2	1	475156	12/2/07	I question his ability as both an educator and an administrator.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Leonard	3.1	2	Engineering		5	5	5	3	475156	11/2/04	Great Professor. Easy to understand. Very clear. Good guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth  Lerner	5.0	2	History		5	5	5	3	1800158	3/2/13	Awesome professor. His lectures are very interesting and are worth your time to listen to because he is a wonderful story-teller. He assigns weekly homework. It is very easy to do. It is easy to get A in this course. Attendance is mandatory. He is very concerned on how students learn. I wish I could have him as my professor again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Howard Lester	3.5	2	Film	345	5	2	5	5	740322	11/9/12	I had him for Acting for Film and Video, and it was a very interesting experience. He's extremely opinionated (his way or the highway), but he's very funny and a great guy. A lot of the class seemed repetitive (I learned everything in two weeks) but it was a really good class and I would recommend it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Howard Lester	3.5	2	Film		3	5	5	5	740322	12/10/09	Took his Acting Directing classes. Excellent professor. Very outgoing. Not a heavy work load but every class something new is to be learned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Howard Lester	3.5	0	Film		4	2	2	4	740322	1/26/11	High energy, interesting, but rarely productive or informative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		5	1	1	1	563963	6/20/08	Your better off learning from an arts and crafts woman at the park.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	563963	10/2/05	If I had to sum up Judy Levy in one word, it would be NAZI. She treats everyone like kids and can never be satisfied with someone's work. Beware though, she treats the deaf students in her class the worst. My interpreter could not believe the things she would say, or how she said or explained things to me. Normally if you're late, the professor wont say anything until after class, privately. However, Judy will stop the class and scold whoever was late, wasting our time and money. Worst class ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	5	563963	5/15/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	1	563963	3/5/05	Worst 2D teacher ever! Could possibly be Hitler in female form. AVOID her at all costs. I'm an A student and shes just cruel about everything. Shes unclear with her directions and completely unsatisfied with everything. Shes boring as all hell and isn't fair or reasonable. Hell an 89.5 is a B!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	4	563963	2/1/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		1	1	2	3	563963	5/30/07	Judy Levy was an absolute nightmare. She made three girls in my class cry by asking them over and over "why are you an art major?". Her classes were boring, her lectures were useless, and she spoke to the entire class like we were 1st graders. Avoid her class at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	1	563963	9/3/05	Treats her students like they're kindergarteners and gives the most irrelevant assignments imaginable. I think in a past life she was a ruler weilding nun. I had more work in this class than all my other classes combined and learned NOTHING from it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	1	563963	4/23/05	this is a teacher that actually teaches. she is very helpful. i learned a lot in class for a photo student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judith Levy	2.0	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	4	563963	2/2/05	Judy never seems to be satisfied with your work no matter how much effort you put into it. It wasn't the worst class ever, but I'd avoid it if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cathy Leyland	2.1	0	Graphic Arts		3	1	1	4	1067694	5/21/12	If you are looking for a class to really improve your web graphics skills, this is NOT the class for you. Assignments consisted of archaic techniques that would maybe be relevant 8 years ago (animated gif banners, slices and designing an "unusual page layout").
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cathy Leyland	2.1	1	Graphic Arts		3	3	2	3	1067694	5/10/12	Not very comprehensive, throws a ton of stuff at you at once and it takes a while to figure out what you're supposed to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cathy Leyland	2.1	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	4	1067694	5/21/12	Are you an RIT student living permanently in the year 2004? Are you interested in Web design? Boy, is this the Professor for you. If you want an A be prepared to put an unreasonable amount of time into terrible looking designs in accordance to incredibly outdated trends. Otherwise, you will never receive full credit for good work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cathy Leyland	2.1	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	1067694	12/5/07	Nicest woman you'll ever meet. She really cares about all of her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Liberson	3.4	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	1690245	2/22/13	He's a clear professor; has clear guidelines, expects you to ask questions if you don't understand something, and loves answering them. Very reasonable in grading-strict, but fair. He has industry experience and cares about his students. I would highly recommend taking his class. He also has a great sense of humor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Liberson	3.4	0	Engineering		3	2	1	3	1690245	2/29/12	thick accent makes him impossible to understand. class wasn't too hard, though the final is worth 50% of the grade so its hard to know how you're doing in the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Liberson	3.4	1	Engineering		1	3	2	3	1690245	2/17/13	He has a thick accent, so sit near the front if you want a chance to hear him. He also writes small and badly. Taking notes is kind of hard, a TA suggested to close your eyes and write what he says, not what's on the board. He's a nice guy and quizzes are partner quizzes with help from him. Tests are brutal. Go to class! Trust me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Liberson	3.4	2	Engineering		5	5	4	4	1690245	2/1/12	He's very helpful and willing to help students.Class is fast paced and can become difficult if you miss a day of class. Do your homework and in class assignments and you will get a good grade. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laurence Liebson	3.0	1	Business		3	3	3	3	1632156	10/27/11	Took his class. Not bad. Just a lot of projects and case studies, but he gave us reasonable time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science		4	4	4	3	66036	2/22/13	After a withdrawal, I was not looking forward to retaking this course, but I'm thankful it was with Prof. Lindberg. His lectures were extremely clear and his tests were pretty clear cut. Keep up to date on the labs and their abstracts and do well on the tests and you're golden.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science		3	5	5	3	66036	2/23/12	Great Professor, very approachable, makes physics easier. He is willing to help and work with the student to make sure that they understand the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	311	3	4	3	5	66036	10/17/11	(University Physics) Great professor. Very approachable, very interested in getting students to understand material. Quizzes and tests are fair- he doesn't make them super difficult just to trick you. Workload is average.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	311	4	5	5	5	66036	1/25/11	Very good teacher. Gives examples on just about every problem you would see on a test, and is crystal clear with his explainations. Throws in a few jokes every now and then, and also is very approachable outside the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	311	5	4	4	3	66036	11/13/08	This is one of the easiest professors I have had, he doesn't lecture much, most of class is spent to problems, but the tests are easier than the example problems. From what I've heard of other physics professors at this school, he has to be one of the best. The text book was never used, I wasted $130 on that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	1	Science		3	3	3	5	66036	4/27/07	Had for special relativity. Easy class. Easy tests (gave all formulas at the top). Homework not too bad, but it was a 2-credit intro course. Notes okay, lecture quite boring (but it was all algebra...). Seems kind of absent minded. But, he will help if you go to him. Seems generally nice. Maybe not the greatest prof ever, but it works.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	0	Science		1	1	1	5	66036	8/19/05	omg i hate this teacher he sucked i could pass any test he was so unclear hes testist were hard

Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science		4	5	5	5	66036	4/30/12	Great teacher!!! Should take Univ Phys 1A with him if at all possible. Clear teaching style and throws in jokes to keep your attention. If you are ever struggling ask him for help and you will be able to understand the material. Textbook is a great supplement to homework too. (if you understand the homework the exams are easy to understand)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	311	4	5	4	3	66036	10/25/11	He's one of the best profs in the department. Very clear lecturer, makes you think but isn't challenging. All the practice problems are doable and the homework is not overwhelming. Do not need the textbook for the class - he will tell you about how to buy only Mastering Physics to save money. Would definitely take again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	311	2	4	5	5	66036	2/2/11	Great professor, he's friendly, approachable, clear, and helpful. Physics is not easy and his class is no exception but he presents the information very well and tries to give partial credit where he can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science		3	5	5	2	66036	2/3/10	Seriously this professor is probably one of the best physics professor around. he taught me everything that my high school physics teacher tried and more. highly recommend. he will do anything to help you get by and get the best grade possible. he makes rit physics doable. hands down best physics teacher around
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	1	Science		1	2	3	2	66036	1/28/08	Very nice guy, but tests were hard. HW was easy labs were easy. but had to withdrawal because I could not get above a 50% on the test. Takes off a lot for stupid mistakes like negative signs and lectures are quite boring
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science	313	5	5	5	5	66036	2/8/07	Great professor. Lectures are simplified so anyone can understand them, not a lot of work, and if you pais attention in class you will do well on the tests. Really nice guy, too. Helpful when you don't understand what's going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vern Lindberg	4.0	2	Science		2	5	5	NULL	66036	12/24/03	very nice, caring, good professor, when you need help, GO TO HIM INSTEAD OF STUGGLING..
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	2	Engineering	215	4	5	4	5	609851	8/28/12	I totally disagree with those that say Prof. Link is not good at conveying his knowledge to the students. He often cites real world examples to show the application of what he is teaching. The only people that didn't do well were the ones that thought they didn't have to take notes, wouldn't get off of facebook, or come to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	0	Engineering		2	1	2	2	609851	5/14/09	He's a really nice guy but a horrible professor. He knows his stuff but is utterly incapable of conveying his knowledge to students. He claims to want to teach "understanding" but all he does is go against the book and confuse people. If you can, stay away from taking a class with him. You're better off with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	609851	1/31/07	Really wants you to understand the material but is not good at teaching AT ALL. He doesn't like to use formulas or memorizations but is unable to teach you to understand his way.

Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	2	Engineering	214	3	5	5	5	609851	2/15/12	Excellent Professor that is will to help you in all ways that he can. He is clear in class as well as lab. He expects you to attend class and follow in reading and homework and with that you should have no problem in his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	609851	4/21/08	Terrible Teacher, explains things in a way that DOES NOT help with understanding how anything actually works, he's very strict with his labs even though he is lazy as hell and doesn't do anything he says he will and likes to take off points for anything he can on tests/labs/quizes...
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	609851	8/11/06	Good teacher who want's you to actually understand the material instead of memorize it. Very good at explaining. He reserves 5% of the final grade for his discretion to boost or bring down your grade if he feels you have/haven't shown him that you understand the material. I enjoyed his classes alot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Link	2.9	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	609851	5/1/05	Professor Link is a good professor, who values his classes, and their success very highly. However, the talking on the cell phone during class has to stop. other than that, he is usually accessable during his office hours. I highly reccomend him for Electronics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Listman	4.4	2	Sign Language		4	5	5	5	1338606	11/15/12	Great teacher, really tells you what he wants outright. grading is fair. helps build you up, even with criticism.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Listman	4.4	2	Sign Language		4	5	5	4	1338606	10/24/11	Jason is really great! He sometimes signs a little fast, but makes fun of himself for doing it when you ask him to slow down. He is crazy helpful and really encourages questions and participation. His tests are easy if you practice and pay attention. I'm learning a whole lot (even stuff not in the textbook).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Listman	4.4	2	Sign Language		3	5	4	5	1338606	2/1/10	He's very helpful and is quick to respond to emails. He's willing to meet with you outside of class if you need additional help. You can tell he actually puts time into He does finger spell a bit on the fast side which can be difficult when learning but slows down if you ask I recomend him to everyone and would totally take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Listman	4.4	2	Sign Language		2	3	5	4	1338606	5/10/12	I had him for asl 1 and 2. He's tough but a great teacher, you learn so much with him. His grading can be harsh at times but he makes sure you leave asl understanding the grammar and how to sign correctly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Listman	4.4	2	Sign Language		4	4	4	5	1338606	5/3/10	Overall a very nice teacher. He's perfected the balance between fun and learning, and I looked forward to going to class everyday. He's very good at conversational signs and everyday terms. He's a bit difficult to understand sometimes, but it's not horrible. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xumin Liu	2.5	2	Computer Science	771	5	5	3	5	1410469	5/8/12	While she can be difficult to understand at times due to poor English pronounciations, all the material that appeared on tests were gone over in class and are posted in notes online. There were absolutely no surprises. She gives out ungraded assignments in class for practice, and they are harder than that you will see on tests, leaving you prepared
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xumin Liu	2.5	1	Computer Science		5	3	3	3	1410469	5/16/11	She is easy in grading
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xumin Liu	2.5	0	Computer Science		3	2	2	3	1410469	12/7/11	Not clear most of the time and presentations suck. It seems like its the first time she's seeing the slides. She proceeds to talk (while facing the slides) and try to figure out what exactly the slide is talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xumin Liu	2.5	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	3	1410469	4/9/10	Worst English I've heard at RIT(strong accent, mispronunciations, bad grammar). Was new, made some mistakes. The tests and quizzes were curiously spotty on coverage.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design	114	1	5	4	1	468510	12/7/11	Steve is by and large my favorite teacher. I had no interest in 3D art until I took this class, and now I'm wishing he offered more classes. The workload he puts out it very time intensive and he expects you to be in class, so this is not a class to take lightly but it is an amazing experience. Until you take, You have no idea what you can create.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		2	4	5	5	468510	10/26/05	good teacher, strong ethics and morals show through when he grades. you will have to work hard to do well in this class, however it is well worth it and will make you a better designer. has a set design project which lasts a few weeks and is really fun
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		1	3	4	4	468510	8/24/05	his class was very intreging, everything we did was something not alot of people would ever get to experiance and that made it hard but very interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		3	5	5	4	468510	10/27/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		3	5	4	4	468510	1/19/06	He always made time to talk to everyone individually, which helps a lot especially in your 1st year! His projects were a little more in depth than most other teachers, u could tell he really put time into it. and his crit's were actually NOT boring! you could say that u hated the project he was open to all feedback.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		2	5	4	5	468510	9/9/05	Steve was one of the best teachers I've ever had the honor to meet. His lessons were meant to intrique and was amazing when it came to really getting the student involved, teaching them the skills they needed for the real world of design, not just for school. He really made you earn your credits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Loar	4.3	2	Design		2	3	4	4	468510	7/7/05	Steve-o... He is a great teacher, but can sometimes be increadibly picky. He wants things his way or the high way, the class will be easier for you if you just comply to that right away. He has alot of experience and is open to new ideas. I learned alot from this guy and am sad he is leaving RIT.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	2	Science		1	4	5	5	102779	12/15/11	Took all his classes. If you put an effort, you'll get an A. Don't fret so much about the grades you get on the exams. Oh yeah, memorize every single thing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	0	Science		1	1	1	5	102779	11/19/10	worst prof ever.memorize hundreds of bacterial species.useless prof.hate him.stay away from him if u don't want to suffer!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	1	Science		2	3	3	5	102779	3/6/07	Hands out all the notes u'll need before each class. Reads straight from it - don't need to go to class really if u have a copy. Interesting material but boring delivery. VERY detail-oriented. Memorize the 60+pg of slides for each test and u'll do fine. Most ppl get around 40-50, so the curve is huge (75=A) - don't panic if ur getting 70s!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	0	Science		1	1	3	4	102779	1/27/05	HORRIBLE, took him for 3 classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	2	Science		1	2	5	2	102779	4/11/11	Bioremediation and Microbio WW- REALLY HARD PROF, but he tells you what he tests on, his tests formatted very similar, GO TO CLASS, you WILL LEARN A LOT. it's just hard in the 10 week quarter system to remember it all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	0	Science		1	1	2	1	102779	11/29/07	WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HIM. HE GIVES YOU THE LECTURE SLIDES (50-70PAGES), ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MEMORIZE THE INFORMATION WORD BY WORD
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Lodge	2.4	0	Science		3	1	1	3	102779	10/2/05	Needs to spell check his notes, Needs too loose the chip
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaus Lojasiewicz	3.0	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	5	1253037	2/22/13	Good professor. Took a while to understand his accent but you get used to it. His grading is kind of funky with no curve and quizzes every class all for a total of 100 points. All of his quizzes and tests are open notes which kind of makes you dependent on them for the final, on which they aren't allowed. Overall, a good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaus Lojasiewicz	3.0	1	Mathematics		4	2	3	3	1253037	2/5/09	A good teacher. Lectures are understandable. He has a thick polish accent, which all might not be able to understand well. However, his tests are easy and the whole course is open book and open notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaus Lojasiewicz	3.0	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	1	1253037	11/30/11	Homework not graded in this class. Thought i was doing okay, and ended up with a C. Only grades come from quizzes every week, 3 tests, and final. Professor uses long and unnecessarily complicated methods . Very nice, but not helpful or easy to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	314	4	5	5	4	903599	2/23/13	Very clear. Teaches half class, rest is to work on ungraded worksheets to help you learn. 1 quiz a week. Tests very clear. Allows formula sheets. Teaches calculator shortcuts. Makes sure you understand. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		4	1	2	1	903599	11/15/12	Overall, a terrible professor. Very unclear with his expectations and won't answer your questions. However, his tests are not that terrible. Do your work, show up to class, and study THE BOOK for the test and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	3	903599	11/3/11	Not sure what the other raters are complaining about. Is very clear on expectations for the class and materials. Posts almost everything online. Allows a formula sheet for quizzes and exams. Gives out practice problems at every lecture. Work can be challenging or easy depending on how you practice it. Solicits questions and seeks to help students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	903599	4/13/11	Worst professor I've ever had. He gets confused going over his lectures and is pretty disorganized. You can't follow what he writes on the board. If not for the weekly quizzes, you'd be better off staying at home.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	1	903599	11/10/10	not worth attending class at all. useless except for the worksheets which all get posted on line. explained nothing, didn't know how to use consistent variables, and never answered a single question asked. should probably not have a phd
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	4	903599	5/12/10	worst teacher i have ever had hands down, he just spouts things for you to memorize without any comprehensible explanation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	319	1	1	1	3	903599	11/22/09	Very poor communication skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	903599	11/18/08	This teacher is very egotistical, not comical,extremely unhelpful, unfair, and unethical. I can't believe he is even a teacher. I question who does the hiring process for teachers at RIT. Beware!!! Never take any of his classes. You will regret taking any class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	319	1	1	2	1	903599	5/23/08	I agree with everyone who said Long is worst professor ever. I gave a lot of effort and he did nothing to help me when I had questions/problems on the online HW. He makes jokes and no students laugh. His class room is a bad environment. He is a bad teacher and has an attitude like he is the greatest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	903599	3/23/08	This is the most awuful teaching ever done. at the beginning of the quarter(more like 1st and the 2nd class)you will think he is really funny, then, he will realized that he is really DUMB. His lectures are so DRY and very hard to understand.he can not explain concep well. you have to study the text book really hard. or find a tutor to rely on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	1	903599	11/18/12	Awesome. Three times a charm. Made it through and really understood. Taught so I had to understand it finally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	4	903599	2/17/12	I don't know what everyone is so upset about, this guy is a great professor. He is very clear about how to do well in the class: show up, do the daily assignments, the online hw and study before the tests. Just do what you are supposed to and listen in class and you will get an A no problem. In class work is group work. He is easy to u
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	903599	5/19/11	He won't show the steps how to get the answers. He added too many tricky questions that we will never understand. I got D in that class. Terrible professor I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	903599	11/18/10	Got a D and F on first two test. Went to see him before the final, great help, told me what was going to be on final and got an A on final. Allow me to replace F test with final exam grade and got B for the course!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	903599	10/21/10	Great! Don't know why other ratings so low. Does make you work, but if do the homework and study, easy A. Tells you what is going to be on quiz and tests, very helpful on questions or in office. Lectures are dry but with decent attempts at humor followed by work sessions that he helps you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	903599	4/22/10	He was one of the worse teachers that I have ever had the displeasure of trying to learn from....avoid if you value your sanity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	3	3	903599	11/12/09	Great teacher, provides great one on one help during office hours. Group assignments are very helpful, and the homework assignments are relevent. Reading the textbook is highly recommended due to some misclarity on formulas.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	3	1	903599	11/12/08	terrible teacher, very unhelpful, never completely answered our questions. Instead he sent us to the book and made us look for the answer there, the book was very unhelpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	903599	3/30/08	this is the worst Prof i have ever had so far. he basically does not teach you anything in class. you definitely cannot rely on him. you have to read text book really hard and understand it. he does not cover nothing in the class. in his class, you will get the feeling that what you are getting from the school is not worth what youve paid for.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	101	2	1	2	3	903599	11/29/07	Boring. More than half the class fell asleep every class. Very hard to understand when he teaches it to you. Goes back and forth on things and people in the class have to correct him. Go to him for help, not pleasant to work with. If you have a choice, do not take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	3	903599	11/14/07	Hard, but very helpful and fair, very practical and interesting examples. Hope I can remember all of this for my job.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	351	4	5	5	3	903599	5/23/07	Great final. Went to him before final, spent a lot of time explaining stuff, studied what he told me, did well on final and on course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	262	5	4	4	5	903599	5/17/07	This class is soooo booring and the prof does nothing about it. He tries to teach at the lowest level of students using such simple examples. The class is filled with HS students who should forget using math in there jobs. There are some of us who plan on taking the next level but may not make it because we are still doing basic boring stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	351	3	5	5	4	903599	5/1/07	Very Helpful. Saw him just before exam and he explained probelems which turned out to be on exam. Told us to study homework, worksheets, text and notes. Sure enough, problems from each were on exam. Aced exam!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	351	1	1	1	1	903599	4/27/07	This professor sucks ass. He answers your call and dial random number on your cellphone if you happen to have a ringing cellphone in class. And he makes a lot of mistake while writing on the white board.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	261	1	2	1	2	903599	4/3/07	I'm easy going and give every class and teacher a fair try, however I must say he is the worst Math teacher I have ever had. The tests are very difficult, the quizzes are difficult, he teaches in mathematical dialect and acknowledges we don't understand it but is reluctant to help. It's like he's trying to fail you, I would stay away at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	903599	2/17/07	answers questions with questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	262	2	4	5	4	903599	2/5/07	Great teacher, hard but fair, very well organized and willing to help students succeed. First class was difficult as there were many ill prepared students, but second class (262) much better. Short lectures followed by many problems which then can appear on quiz and exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	4	903599	10/29/06	Nice guy 'n all, but I don't really think he's cut out for teaching calc in any way, shape or form. I mean let's look at our class, 4 or so As, like 7 or so Bs...and the rest is boardline or IS failing...He simply writes what's in the text on the board and tells us what it is, but doesn't explain it, if I wanted that i woulda bought an audio tape.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	903599	11/13/07	This is the most awuful teaching ever done. His lectures are so DRY and boring. I recommend anybody to stay away from him. If you want good grades he's not the one
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	2	903599	5/22/07	Do not take him if you have other options. I gave an honest effort to pass his class and he was useless. The only way you can learn anything on topic is to rely on a tutor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	261	1	1	1	1	903599	5/15/07	Um, no...just no, don't take him its frustrating. in fact the whole calc foundations thing is stupid, if you get put in it take calc A its easier. oh and long cant teach, hes really a chem teacher and RIT just put him in to teach calc to their easiest calc classes, doesn't make much sense not to get someone good to teach the people who need help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	351	3	5	5	4	903599	5/1/07	Very Helpful. Saw him just before exam and he explained probelems which turned out to be on exam.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics	262	1	5	4	3	903599	4/3/07	Yea, this guy is so hard, it makes my head swim. I can't even remember what class I am in. Is it 261 or 262? I should know, it is my 3rd time through. Wish I was still in high school, that was easier and I could handle it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	903599	2/21/07	This was my second time taking this course and having Dr. Long definitely improved my experience and understanding of statistics. He was always helpful, using relevant and easy to understand examples. I would recommend his course to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	261	2	2	2	4	903599	2/5/07	not a good teacher, tests and quizzes are hard and are the only grades. Class is boring, Dr Long focuses on the simple questions and not the more difficult ones which tend to be on the test. aviod!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Long	2.5	0	Mathematics	261	2	1	1	4	903599	12/4/06	Possibly the worst math teacher I have ever had OR seen in my entire life. Nice guy 'n all, cannot relay information to students worth of crap. He made the power rule confusing to some people. Not sure entirely how he pulled it off, but he did. Avoid his calc classes at all costs. Definitely knows his stuff though.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sonia Lopez Alarcon	1.5	0	Engineering		2	1	2	2	1404261	4/22/10	Tough grader on questions that she makes herself, which are often hard to understand. Poor grammar and language use even in exam problems. Homework is even worse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Louvain	3.8	1	Computer Science	361	2	3	3	2	1631128	11/16/12	Eh, she was just okay. A lot of boring slides that she read from, but she was very nice. I don't think you can avoid a dull class with SE. You will always have to learn the annoying buzzwords and methods.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Louvain	3.8	1	Computer Science	361	3	2	3	4	1631128	6/13/12	Takes off points for the most arbitrary things, exams are filled with learning her buzz words and reciting them back to her. Adequately easy, take another professor if you actually want to learn something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Louvain	3.8	2	Computer Science	361	3	4	5	5	1631128	11/2/11	Overall a good professor. Grades were very fair in terms of the number, but sometimes the things taken off for seemed a bit weird/picky. Would take a class with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Louvain	3.8	2	Computer Science	361	3	4	5	5	1631128	10/18/12	She grades very fairly for the weekly deliverables for the project and for tests. She is also very easy to talk to for any help you need on a topic. You might need to look over things she says in lectures a few more times to fully understand them, however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robin Louvain	3.8	2	Computer Science	361	3	4	5	5	1631128	11/2/11	She can be a picky grader but the points she takes off are generally deserved and fair. Teaches a lot from the textbook. She can be a nice professor and is helpful when you ask her questions. Makes expectations very clear. The majority of the classwork is a group project and group work, so try to get into a good group for that. Study for the exams!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhaolin Lu	3.3	2	Engineering	473	5	4	4	4	1037016	2/28/11	Good class. Can explain complicated concepts in simple ways.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhaolin Lu	3.3	0	Engineering	473	2	2	1	3	1037016	10/10/07	Has a very thick asian accent. Relies heavily on powerpoint which is used very poorly. I learned more on my own. Avoid this professor. Scales tests occasionally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhaolin Lu	3.3	0	Engineering	308	1	1	1	1	1037016	1/15/09	not clear in language. not helpful in learning.

Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	478844	4/23/06	if you want examples, get out of the class. if you want to go off on tangents then this is the class to be in. also, test review packets SUCK .. most of the answers in the key are wrong so idk wtf help it is. he = lame
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	5	478844	11/9/05	Too much homework and if you slip slightly in his class you're done for
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	478844	10/21/05	He sometimes has no idea what he is doing. Makes often mistakes on problems, and seems to skip steps when drawing problems out on the board. The only way I learn in this course is from the worksheets, and my fellow students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	478844	9/3/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	478844	1/30/05	He has a well stuctured class, so it was easy to get on the right track. Just come in, go over the previous days hw, he lectures, and then he assigns a new set of problems. The hw is optional, but its really helpful to do it and go over it with the class. He communicates well while lecturing too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	478844	10/25/04	Had him for Calc A. Clear speaker, shows all steps so you won't be lost. Easy to approach with questions; helpful. Goes over all homeworks, asks you for problems he can help you with. Gives you answer keys to homework assignments & tests you get back. I like him and I'm signing up for him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	478844	1/30/06	Very good teacher, explains the concepts in a clear and concise manner. Theres a ton of homework but it is optional as he doesn't collect it. I never did any of it and got A's in both classes because he taught so well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	478844	11/7/05	If you can deal with the homework, then he is the best teacher to take. 4 quizzes, 3 major test, worksheet, & final will count toward your grade. HMK is optional, but if you don't do them, you might get lost. Easy to get an A if you keep up your work
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	478844	10/19/05	Excellent. I've had 3 calc professors and he is by far the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	478844	3/7/05	Clear speaker, optional homework. He's Canadian.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R Luce	3.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	478844	12/6/04	Very good professor, teaches a couple different ways to do everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	2	Engineering		4	4	3	5	602743	2/27/12	Overall a good professor. He's a bit difficult to understand at times since he talks quietly and he has an accent, but it wasn't so bad that I didn't understand the material. When not going over stuff on powerpoint, he was a good lecturer, but the powerpoints get boring and ineffective quickly. Pretty easy grader, though. I'd recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	0	Engineering		2	2	2	4	602743	3/1/07	The other ratings on this board are completely wrong, and I know I speak for my entire class, moves fast through the material with little explination. Puts little effort into homework solutions, hardly any office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	602743	7/4/05	Great instructor - he knows the stuff. Clear and thorough, despite this being his first class in english he is always easy to understand (making sure as well that everyone can understand him) and moves at a steady pace - not too slow or fast. He is strict but fair, and did offer makeup when the entire class except a few failed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	2	Engineering	351	4	4	4	5	602743	2/8/10	I'm very glad I chose this teacher for HDL. He explains the labs VERY well. VERY lenient grader. Just try to sit in the front row of the classroom so you can hear him clearly. He has a little bit of an accent, but THAT DOESN'T MATTER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	602743	9/15/05	Dr. Lukowiak is a very patient teacher, willing to give plenty of extra help. He will explain things more than once, and doesn't rush through his lectures. He is always in the lab sections, walking around helping out, and will meet outside of class time if you are having trouble with anything. I would definitely recommend taking any of his classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marcian Lukowiak	4.1	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	602743	4/21/05	Great teacher, explains things in an easy to understand fashion, and is ALWAYS willing to go over topics you may have missed. He will do anything he can to help, and really helps students do well. GREAT TEACHER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ti Lin Liu	3.3	2	Engineering	302	4	3	4	4	1404472	1/30/12	Great Professor, take him if you can! He has an accent but if you understood Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid you'll be fine. He's pretty funny and a lenient grader. Teaches well, but you gotta pay attention. Don't skip classes and copy down everything he writes on the board. Tests are a reflection of class so study your notes and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ti Lin Liu	3.3	0	Engineering	303	2	2	2	4	1404472	11/25/10	Lin Liu might know what he's doing, but he's not very good at explaining it. He speeds through things that are impossible to understand. Very generous with grading though. He is very supportive. Says things like, "you good student", and "you the best". Unfortunately he is not the best. You will use the textbook a lot to learn everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ti Lin Liu	3.3	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	1404472	2/15/11	He's a responsible teacher although he has some accent, but if you really pay attention in his class you will learn everything. homeworks are from the book, one take home exam, one inclass, one pre-final(you can do group work). and he will curve for final grade, easy A if you do all the homeworks. exams weigh less than homeworks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yu Fang Liu	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	1535620	11/14/12	Awesome professor! She will help you as much as she can! Take her. Praise you for your hard work, make u feel good inside.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yu Fang Liu	4.9	2	Languages		4	5	5	5	1535620	10/18/11	AWESOME INSTRUCTOR!!! Just make sure you listen and follow what Liu Laoshi (Laoshi means Teacher). She emails every week what and when are the assignments due. Each hour, she makes sure that the class stays active in listening, speaking, and learning. She's the best. Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yu Fang Liu	4.9	2	Languages		3	5	4	5	1535620	10/21/11	The beginning was tough because my darn old brain wasn't opening itself to a completely whole new language among with a new way to writing Chinese in strokes. Had a lot of bumps in the start, but eventually smoothed out with a lot of help from Liu Laoshi. Grades fairly and gives out reasonable amount of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yu Fang Liu	4.9	2	Languages	420	5	5	5	5	1535620	10/17/11	She is very nice and helpful during and outside of class. Its an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Locke	1.0	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	1365806	11/19/09	He is the rudest professor you will ever have. He doesn't like helping students and whenever you ask for help, he gives you a dirty look and mutters rude comments about you. He is full of himself and he always criticizes the students how slow they are at using the lab machinery. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	1	563919	12/2/08	All the way from Poland, English is his third language making him hard to understand. He teaches things in a harder way than they need to be(i.e. factoring) and homework reminds me of nothing we did in class. quizzes are decent. If you dont already knwo the material dont expect to learn it from this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	3	563919	5/1/05	I loved Stan... very easy. Only went to class on test and quiz days, got 100 on each one. Easy A because he wants you to do well, unlike some teachers. If you have any idea about the course, you should do fine with Stan. He's just a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	2	563919	3/3/05	If you understand the material and can learn from the book by all means take him. He goes extremely fast through problems, has a thick accent, and his writing is highly illegible. The amount of work he gives is a joke. There is no HW and the tests/quizes are very short - just know what you're doing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	563919	1/31/05	His thick Polish accent makes it very difficult to understand what he is even saying in lectures, and his handwriting is awful so it's hard to read the notes he puts on the board
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	563919	8/30/05	awesome eacher. his accent is a bit tough to deal with and his tendency to repeat words, but its kinda funny. a very fair teacher. follow what he does, take notes and you should ace the course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	4	563919	3/10/05	Took Diff. Eqn., Eng. Math with Stan. If you're some what intelligent in math then take him; it will be an easy A. Enjoy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan Lojaieswick	2.6	0	Mathematics		3	3	1	1	563919	2/3/05	Polish accent takes a while to get used to. Notes are extremely confusing. Open note quizzes/tests makes it easy, but all in all if you really wanna learn calculus, i wouldn't recommend this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Long	4.8	2	Film		2	4	5	4	1128562	1/8/13	He's a great professor and makes you learn a lot! It's tough material to grasp, but he makes it interesting. Take this professor if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Long	4.8	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1128562	2/17/09	all the upperclassmen talked about of horrible fundamentals of computers and imaging was, so I was worried at first. However, the class is very interesting and David Long is very knowledgeable and really knows how to teach the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Long	4.8	2	Film		2	4	5	4	1128562	3/31/10	Course material can be difficult but he realizes this. Get your homework and labs in on time, study for the quizzes and final and you'll do fine. Very approachable if you don't understand something. Don't copy the powerpoint notes but rather write what he lectures orally and what he writes on the board - very important! You can use notes on quizzes
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Long	4.8	2	Film		4	5	5	5	1128562	4/28/08	One of the best teachers I've ever had. His class is very easy just because he knows how to teach complicated information in ways oblivious students can understand. He knows his stuff very well, and is full of random interesting facts. Don't be afraid of taking FCI 8-12 +2-4, its early but he understands this, so its not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics	281	1	2	2	4	515816	11/20/12	He's a nice guy, but he's difficult to understand. He over explains everything to the point where you can't follow what he's trying to teach. He also tends to lose track of what he's saying and go back and correct things in the problems after having already explained them. He's quite confusing. Don't take him if you don't have to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics	331	4	5	3	1	515816	5/21/12	homework is simple if you understand the materials, uses a day to go over homework, quizzes are usually on homework, if you go to office hours he is helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics	281	1	3	2	4	515816	2/3/12	Good guy bad teacher. Strict grading of tests and poor lectures. He wants to see his students excel and is very interested in the theory behind the math he teaches, problem is that he can be incomprehensible at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics	101	3	5	2	3	515816	10/26/11	Good guy, boring class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	515816	9/12/10	Best Calc teacher I ever had, very helpful and understanding. Must do homeworks and ask questions to get an A. I was scared o calc but he made it interesting and got an easy A. Highly recomended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics	123	1	5	5	3	515816	10/27/09	He is stuck with having to explain a lot of hard material in a short amount of time, and he does a great job of it- The most helpful and approachable teacher Ive had yet. He presents everything in a logical manner with great notes unlike other teachers who bounce around. Try to get him, but expect to work. He hints about test material all the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics	282	3	3	2	3	515816	1/27/09	Not my favorite professor but does know what he's doing most of the time. He sometimes makes mistakes that he questions. Tests are kind of hard. Overall he's not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	3	515816	5/22/06	He can teach alright when he isn't off on another topic, but he lacks all skills of being a TEACHER. Honestly now, what teacher starts the first day of class without even introducing themselves, or gives a test without even being able to tell you what chapters/sections are included on the test. Also, it takes atleast 4-5 weeks to get anything back other than tests which is about 1-2 weeks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	515816	10/18/05	Great teacher, not a hard class if you do the work, he gives make-up tests and lets you earn back lost points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics		3	2	1	3	515816	2/22/05	Very hard to understand his explinations. Beginning of the quarter he says tests are questions from the homework, which isn't the case. Read the book, you'll learn more. He can't concentrate on one topic while teaching, he is all over the board and you never know what is coming next in his lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics	281	2	2	2	3	515816	10/5/12	I often feel like he doesn't know what he's talking about. At least once every class he forgets what he's saying or writes something inccorrect on the board and has to go back and fix it. He often doesn't directly answer questions that are asked and explains things in a very round about way that makes it seem more complicated than it really is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics	282	2	2	2	4	515816	3/27/12	Horrible professor. He grades really strictly. His class is set up so that you score 10% lower than you should and gives you a hard bonus project at the end. But be warned, he cheated us out of our bonus! He is very annoying to listen to lecture, he uses the word "right" at least once in every sentence. I suggest you avoid this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics	281	2	3	1	2	515816	11/10/11	Lopez focuses on the theory that proves why each math concept is true. He does not do a lot of practice problems beside a few problems he assigns for homework. The tests he tends to assign difficult problems the only advise I can give you is form study groups and do lots of problems that are in the book. He's hard to understand and misspells a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	3	515816	10/25/11	He's a nice guy and if you lead him in the right direction with questions it's easier to get the material, but his way of teaching didn't really work for me. It felt like he made everything more complicated than it needed to be. He told me to study the homework for a test, and the test had next to nothing to do with the homework. Overall...okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics	123	3	5	4	1	515816	4/22/10	He really cares about teaching, and he really wants everyone to understand. Best math prof I've had by far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics	282	1	3	2	4	515816	2/24/09	The tests were TERRIBLE. As was the grading policy. I sailed through Calc I and got an A and in his class I failed the first two tests after studying the stuff he told me to study. He expects you to memorize unimportant things, little to none partial credit is given, and there were no opportunities to make up lost points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	4	515816	11/18/06	After taking AP Calc last year i expected this class to be fairly easy. The material wasn't that difficult but anytime i went to Professor Lopez for help, he would make a mistake and we'd have to search for his error for 15 min. He complicated the most basic of concepts. I would suggest getting into another profressors class if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	515816	3/2/06	Lopez is great! He tends to ramble and write LOTS of stuff on the board from the book, but he is super smart and VERY nice and will always help you out if you need it. Tests aren't too bad, although the final is always harder than the other tests. Not flexible when it comes to homework extensions, but very nice all the same. Right guys?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	4	515816	5/1/05	He is alright and helpful. He can be kind of strict sometime and once he marked it wrong, you better not argue with him about the answer unless you have 100% proof for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	515816	2/17/05	2nd quarter in a row with Manny..........not very clear in his explanations. The book is much easier to learn from.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	515816	2/1/05	He is funny. He tries very hard to make things clear, and does a good job. always helpful. Funny looking and funny personality.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics		2	4	2	3	515816	11/30/04	"Right? Choo guys? Right? Choo get it?" Very difficult to understand, unclear explanations mixed with an accent made for a very difficult class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	NULL	515816	5/19/04	Lopez doesn't know what he's doing. Well, he knows what he's talking about, but doesn't know how to teach it. His grading also sucks hardcore. Stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	515816	1/27/05	This guy is wrong. Manny is one of the greatest and funniest profs, take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manuel Lopez	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	515816	10/20/04	Most awesome calc teacher. his accent and word use makes class interesting and funny. really nice guy and will help you with anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	0	Mathematics	328	4	2	2	4	1100333	5/24/12	Accent is very tough. Tests always have only 3 questions. Not very clear at answering questions. Teaches directly form the textbook without preparing so he frequently gets confused on the material. Frequently makes mistakes in notes. Tests are straight forward.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	1	Mathematics	306	5	3	3	5	1100333	1/29/11	Doesn't give out that much HW and test are only three questions which are pretty easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	1100333	10/19/10	I don't see why people don't like him. He gives hw once a week for two weeks then a test. Tests have three questions and are not that hard. Overall, better than i expected
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	3	1100333	3/9/11	Accent is really tough, had trouble understanding him all quarter. The material is hard but he walks you through it well. Tests are a large percentage and they are only three questions, so you better not mess anything up too badly or you find yourself with a C very quickly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	1	Mathematics		4	2	3	3	1100333	1/29/11	Homework is worth 20% of the grade and only assigns maybe one per week, eight questions long. Very easy to get an A if you come to class and do a little studying outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carlos Lousto	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	1100333	5/19/08	This is the worst teacher I have had since I've been in RIT. I'm not even sure he knows the subject, I went to his office once and it took him almost 20 minutes just to understand what a question was asking, and this was a question he had assigned for homework! His tests have 3 questions, and he is very vague on what will be on them. STAY AWAY!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Lovenheim	5.0	2	Writing		4	5	5	4	1697282	11/19/12	Amazing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Lovenheim	5.0	2	Writing	319	5	5	5	5	1697282	3/1/12	Professor was really cool. No tests, quizzes or finals. Small homework assignments. 3 essays through out the quarter, and you could rewrite them to get a better grade. Writing class on animals...he took us to the zoo!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	301	3	2	2	2	1328295	4/15/11	Counting down the days till she leaves! I think we all are. Loved the article in the Democrat and Chronicle about her but it makes us cadets out to look bad too when she is the problem. I feel like she was an earthquake to the program and we are just waiting it out so we can try to rebuild after she leaves. I hope the new PMS is good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC		3	1	1	3	1328295	12/7/10	Yay!!! She's almost gone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	501	4	1	2	4	1328295	2/24/10	She dropped out of West Point after one year and then dropped out of ROTC and got her ?liberal arts? degree from some knock off college. Then she went to OCS to commission. How is she allowed to lead ROTC at one of the hardest universities in the country when she dropped out of ROTC herself!?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	2	Army ROTC		1	4	4	3	1328295	2/15/10	Tough but fair. Challenges all to achieve their best. Has the experience and knowledge to develop character and discipline for those willing to step up, will afford opportunity to complain for those not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	2	Army ROTC		4	4	4	5	1328295	11/18/09	Lubiak's class is mandatory each week but with all of her jokes she keeps the class attentive and above the boredom mark. This class is mostly self-taught. Her exam for fall quarter is hard. 93 questions total. 75% of them are short answers and you have 2 hours to do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	201	2	2	2	5	1328295	10/31/09	I heard about her from other Cadets and gave her the benefit. Thank god I am not contracted! Because of her I will not join the Army. If she is the best the Army has to offer as a leader, I will check out Air Force or Navy ROTC. She seems to hold a grudge, but her nasty attitude and leadership attitude has completely turned me off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	401	1	1	2	4	1328295	10/7/09	The Army investigated her, they wrote in a FOIA release: "A Physical limitation and an aloof manner of personal interaction combined to create a perception that she did not set an example of leading from the front. Her staff became polarized, and Cadets did not trust her."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	502	3	1	2	3	1328295	2/12/11	She is taking 3 points off of our final Mil. Sci. Grades for each absence in PT or Lab which aren't even worth credit and i think they're wellness classes. The syllabus only say's she'll take 1 point for each absence but now she is saying 3 points. She tries to intimidate the cadets to make herself look better
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	1	Army ROTC		2	2	3	2	1328295	6/8/10	Well, I love ROTC but wish I would have went somewhere else. She has just about ruined my college experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	501	2	1	3	2	1328295	2/24/10	haha, that last comment sounds like it was written by Lubiak. She has a learned personality. She doesn't have one of her own and her attempts to make jokes seem rehearsed. "will afford opportunity to complain for those not [willing to step up]". Sure! We all know what happened to cocchini and the colonal that she had talk to us made it pretty clear
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC		4	1	2	5	1328295	12/22/09	Well, class is easy but that's just cause it's mil sci. Lubiak is a bad seed hands down. I don't personally care about her but she's done things to some of my buddies that are just wrong. Honestly thought she'd be court marshaled by now, but I guess working at the pentagon has it's perks. We call her "lead from the back Lubiak" among other things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	202	1	1	1	3	1328295	11/7/09	She skims points off our Military Science grades for PT grades which I'm pretty sure is illegal. I know people that have lost their scholarships for "failing" but I want to know if they failed because of her skimming points off their grades or not. She uses her own erroneous rules to get rid of people she doesn't like. Why doesn't RIT do anything?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	501	1	1	1	3	1328295	10/18/09	Horrible Teacher! she doesn't care about the class of cadets, often told us to make sure we don't end up at the end of the blame line, and told us to never trust the army. I don't understand how she gets away with it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lynn Lubiak	1.9	0	Army ROTC	501	1	1	1	4	1328295	10/7/09	I got a C. When I asked to see my graded work she said that she could not show me my work because no one else asked to see there's. So a few of us asked and she still wouldn't show us simply saying "I have big zeros and little zeros" (who knows what that means) When I told her I was going to contact the college about it she changed my grade. Shady!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	1	Computer Science	444	4	3	3	2	947175	11/18/09	Okay professor. She is a relatively lenient grader and responds promptly to emails. However, I feel like she didn't do a good job measuring project and homework effort that well, as some people got by with doing almost no work and still got a good grade in the class. Also, some her project requirements are a bit ambiguous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	947175	11/12/08	Her teaching style is interesting and she knows a lot about the topic. Her tests and grading are fair, and she is very helpful outside of class. I would take another class with Ludi anytime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	2	Computer Science	549	4	5	4	2	947175	5/1/07	She is an awesome professor. She's very helpful and explains very well. She exams are not bad and she's not a hard grader. Her eye sight is weak but she's a wonderful teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	0	Computer Science		5	1	3	5	947175	8/26/09	SE Freshman Seminar is a joke but it was fun to get to know everyone else in the major. You meet once a week with your team to complete a SE project and compete against others. It seemed like the criteria for the project changed every week and the work needed to complete the project was difficult. Upperclassmen were more help than Ludi.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	1	Computer Science	361	5	2	3	3	947175	5/3/07	Had her for SE1. Tests/quizzes were easy. Project was fun. Class was somewhat boring. Our group found her hard to work with though. I wouldn't take a class with her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Ludi	3.4	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	947175	1/12/07	Professor Ludi is a good instructor. She has very weak eyesight, but knows her stuff really well. She's not too hard of a grader. You won't mind taking her courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	5	575162	11/11/11	Decent prof. Will help you / work with you on grades if needed. You have to be willing to help yourself and not be spoon fed - like college is supposed to be.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology	302	4	4	4	4	575162	11/17/09	Prof. Luts is great. He's flexible with assignment when he needs to be. He turned our practical midterm into a lab because the VMs we were using were so terrible. He goes through PPTs pretty fast but does lots of examples and is great at answering questions. I definitely recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology	402	3	4	5	3	575162	3/13/07	Personally, Pete is an awesome guy. He is always willing to help. If you do not ask any questions, be prepared for him to blow by the PPT's.Dont expect a ton of helpful examples in his lectures either. Be prepared to do a lot of google searches and browsing through the book for code that applies. Labs are 10 times harder than what you learn in clas
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	1	Information Technology		3	3	2	4	575162	10/12/05	He isnt very helpful in class, rough with grades and very unclear talks alot about the theory behind the code and not enough of the code we need
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	1	Information Technology		4	3	2	4	575162	3/1/05	A very harsh grader. He is not willing to help you too much. I asked for extra credit and he brushed me off. Not cool at all. I was disappointed but I still managed to pull a "B" because the class wasnt that hard. He's mean in the class, but isn't too bad of a person outside.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology	302	4	3	5	3	575162	6/1/10	Interesting class, loads the work on you after Midterm but I learned alot. The amount of work you put into this class definitely reflects your grade, don't slack! Take with Lutz
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology	516	4	5	4	4	575162	2/9/09	Pete's a great! If anything, this guy knows his networking. Goes pretty fast through the lectures, but this pays off towards the end of the quarter as he progressively lets class out early. Very willing to help out his students and gave many extensions on due dates. Has the same mindset as his students which makes him very understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	575162	2/24/06	Projects were organized and made sense. Prof. Lutz is very approachable person. He helped out in the lab portion of the class immensily. He helps you to understand what you are doing, he doesn't just tell you how to do it. Good class, Good Professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pete lutz	3.7	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	2	575162	8/31/05	Awful, incredibly boring. Teaches you nothing, just reads the powerepoint slides and nothing more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business	310	4	5	5	1	758440	11/12/12	In class lectures can be a little boring, although I didn't have much interest in the topic to begin with. He is surprisingly helpful and will spend significant amounts of time in class or afterwards to ensure he can help students. Group projects require a lot of time each week, but grading is relatively easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	1	Business	113	3	3	2	4	758440	2/27/12	Extremely boring to listen to. He tells a lot of stories relating to the topics, but really is very ineffective teaching you the course material. Nice guy, just wouldn't recommend taking his class unless you like to listen to lectures for 2 hours straight.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business	310	4	5	3	2	758440	10/21/10	Good professor and very fair. Definitely knowledgeable and helpful if you ask for it. He does, however, tend to go off on tangents and can talk for a long time. It's hard to pay attention when he does, particularly in a long night class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	0	Business		3	1	2	1	758440	2/1/10	Told us 1st day he hasn't taught this course in years, & it shows. Did nothing for the 1st 5 weeks in terms of the project or homeworks, the last 5 weeks we have 5 milestones and 3 cases due making it almost 2 papers a week. When a question is asked, he looks at you blankly and asks you to be more specific or he will ignore you. STAY AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business	101	3	5	4	3	758440	3/3/09	Interesting guy, good examples and Luxmore knows his stuff forwards and backwards. Challenges you to think but you leave knowing your stuff. His project is a beast but he grades fairly. Multiple choice were difficult but is liberal with the short answers on tests. Recommend him without question. Would take a class with him in a heartbeat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	0	Business		1	2	2	2	758440	3/10/08	INTRO TO GLOBAL Class is HARD! Class was strict lecture from power point entire class, every class. Tests were impossible and he refused to curve the tests. Do not take if you want a good grade. DO NOT TAKE LUXMORE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		4	4	4	4	758440	3/7/07	His class is pretty easy. Lectures are somewhat boring although they help a lot when you are studying for the exams. He's an understandable guy that is willing to help. It's overall an easy class but be prepare to let your group project mess your grade up. You have to work with people that you don't even know-never mind trust.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business	360	4	5	5	3	758440	2/9/07	Prof. Luxmore wasn't hard; he would even allow you to argue a point on a test if you could back up your reasoning - VERY fair. Would definitely take this course again with him. Easy teaching style. Extra credit offered, weekly tests, group project (that was the worst part).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		4	4	3	4	758440	4/20/06	Ok, very easy. You take a test every week for the first 10 chapters. finals is only 3 chapters. Do Module Group Project (Easy too), Guaranteed A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		4	5	5	2	758440	11/16/05	Nice professor. Easy class, just pay attention and read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		3	5	4	2	758440	5/22/12	Tests are straight out of the summary in each chapter, no joke. Group project was the toughest aspect, but he gives you plenty of opportunities to correct/extra credit. Overall very helpful if you go to his office.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business	310	3	5	5	3	758440	2/14/12	Very helpful. ALWAYS in office for questions. Plenty of chances to re-write papers for better grade. Friendly and knowledgeable. Posts materials ahead of time on mycourses. Almost no homework besides quarterly group project (broken down into small pieces). Fair grader, relevant tests, should get good grade with normal studying. Overall - awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		3	4	3	3	758440	4/16/10	Had him for Global Business. Professor was really helpful. Class isnt a cake walk though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		3	5	4	3	758440	7/24/09	He tries to make class interesting, you learn a lot from the class. The work he gives you sometimes takes a lot of time to do, but he is really helpful outside class. Test are reasonable, they aren't too hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		3	5	5	3	758440	11/15/08	great teacher, very helpful if you actually take the time to care then he is there to help you out
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	2	Business		3	3	5	5	758440	3/23/07	Great teacher if you go to his office hours he is always there and very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	1	Business		3	2	3	5	758440	3/5/07	Grades on his mood. At the end of the quarter his grades to everyone drops no matter how much time you spent on the cases and project. Horrible teaching methods but easy teacher, if hes in a good mood
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Luxmore	3.6	0	Business		3	1	1	5	758440	5/23/06	Can you still find in a professional college level a teacher who should not be teaching in college??? YESSS this is the teacher,,, the most boring person on earth, that just cannot keep the class motivated towards the subject. His examples are old and so are the videos he shows (80's) like time has not changed since then. Dont take him!!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	2	3	610301	1/17/11	Worst professor I've ever delt with as a 5th year. I had a 93 going into the final, got a C in the class. He REFUSES to use logic while debating a grade. He thinks 377 is a better answer than 120*pi. The book is written by him, so naturally it makes little sense. Bases class off of book, then tests on different things. Homework is impossible. AVOID
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	4	610301	6/4/09	Absolutely horribly teacher. tests and quizzes unrelated to material, grading is random at best. I found a mistake in his answer key and he took it personally. avoid at all cost. I'm serious, If he's the only prof teaching it, take it a different semester... the dean owes me a letter of apology for having this man on staff
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering		1	2	2	2	610301	1/31/08	Very difficult professor, not helpful, hard to understand, no practice problems are given and you have no clue what is going to be on the tests. Dont take this prof!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering	531	1	1	1	3	610301	4/21/10	Terrible Professor. Makes you use his book which is an unintelligible as his lectures. Expect no help from him in class, in office hours, or at review sessions. Grades totally at random and harshly too. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering	531	1	2	1	3	610301	3/3/08	Very very difficult. Makes me wonder about RITs commitment to education over research. Difficult to follow and difficult to understand. Didn't give any homework which made it very difficult to prepare for exams. Makes you buy his textbook, but doesn't even use it for half the class. Don't take him if you have any choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sergey Lyshevski	1.4	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	2	4	610301	5/2/05	Avoid this class at all costs! Totally unclear and poorly developed, average class score on first test around 50. Not helpful one little bit, and hard to understand. You've been warned!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy MacDonald	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	758423	11/7/11	MacDonald was a great teacher- sometimes she drove me crazy and it wasn't easy, but I worked really hard, and when I didn't understand some concepts she worked 1 or 1 with me to make sure I understood it. If you need to take NTID math class, get this teacher! (better than Miriam)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy MacDonald	5.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	758423	11/16/05	This class is unbelievably easy, as for my case though. A very straight-forward class -- simply complete homework, study little by little daily, and should easily be able to pass quizzes and exams. She's willing to help students for those who are in need of help. However, the classes can periodically become boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy MacDonald	5.0	2	Mathematics	884	5	5	5	5	758423	10/12/06	Judy is a nice teacher to be with. Very patient and motivating. She is not strict or hard but will be very flexible with every student who pass through her hands. I have no regret recommending her to any student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maria L MacKin	2.5	1	Health Science		5	2	3	1	1761459	11/5/12	Took her Diagnostic Imaging class. It's a 2 credit joke. Class is mandatory (& extremely boring so bring other work), but it's only once a week and she usually cancels it. Tests are online through mycourses and are directly off of her powerpoints. It is impossible to fail her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosie Madison	4.2	2	Marketing		2	5	5	1	1553175	11/17/12	The class was marketing concepts for graduate students. Very tough grader however willing to help you. Be prepared to critically analyze case studies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosie Madison	4.2	2	Marketing		4	4	3	4	1553175	3/26/11	Professor Madison is really cool. She is strict when it comes to deadlines, but very down to earth and easy to talk to. She definitely cares about her students and makes an effort to learn your name and who you actually are. Reading the book is essential because she will call on you randomly during class! Quizzes were online and only 1 test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosie Madison	4.2	2	Marketing		3	4	4	3	1553175	10/24/11	great professor. by the second week she memorizes everyone's name. she gets you involved in class by throwing questions at students at all times. you gotta be prepared to answer!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics	389	5	4	4	3	1404688	8/5/12	By far the BEST Physics "teacher" at RIT. he teaches his class with lecture followed by working related practice problems in groups. You actually learn in this class, and are not just talked to. He is easy to understand and very helpful. Weekly quizzes, and very fair with homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics	102	4	5	4	3	1404688	5/18/12	Definitely a great professor. Provided hints for mastering physics, and lots of review for tests. Has a slight accent, but other than that one of the best Physics professors in the department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	1404688	2/6/12	THE BEST!!! He does so much extra work for his students. Super helpful in his office hours. I can't say enough good things about this guy. A shining light in the abyss that is RIT's physics dept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	1404688	2/5/11	great techer!!ver lenient!!easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics		5	4	3	5	1404688	11/13/10	Professor Maharjan was an okay teacher. He makes mistakes in his problems somewhat frequently, and has a slight accent. However, his study guides are incredibly representative of the tests and quizzes, and his class ends up being easy as a result. I would recommend him if you have background in the topic and would like a somewhat easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics	212	5	3	4	3	1404688	4/7/10	Prepares you very well for his exams. Tells you almost everything on them. His accent is surprising and difficult to understand at first, but is understandable after a few weeks. Appropriate amount of homework in order to fully understand the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics		5	4	5	5	1404688	7/25/12	One of the best physics profs in the department. Just do all the review problems he gives and you should get an A in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	1	Physics	102	4	3	2	4	1404688	4/30/12	Good teacher, bit of an accent. Had him for College Physics 2. Class consists of a lecture and group work. Homework, quizzes, and exams are fairly straight forward. Never asked him for help, so I don't know how well he is at that. 5/5 would take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics	101	4	3	4	2	1404688	1/11/12	One of the better physics professors I have had. Fairly lenient with grading. The RIT physics department is notorious for having poor professors, and he definitely does not fall into this stereotype.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics		5	5	4	3	1404688	1/24/11	Great Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	0	Physics	211	1	1	1	1	1404688	5/11/10	Horrible teacher! I hated this guy so much. He talks down to you and treats you with ridiculous amount of disrespect. And if he doesn't like you, he will take it out on you on your grades. He will grade you differently from the other students. I went to the Physics dept because of his actions. I will never take him again for anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amir Maharjan	3.8	2	Physics	211	5	5	4	4	1404688	2/26/10	Great teacher, items are graded on technique not on right answers. Does not give much homework on top of the Mastering Physics Online HW. Would like to take another class from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Misha Makara	5.0	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	5	5	5	1	1726378	10/7/12	Misha is an awesome professor he made the course content interesting and entertaining. He related to us how the course material was used in the real world from his own experiences. If he were to teach another class I'd sign up for it in a heartbeat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Misha Makara	5.0	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	3	5	5	5	1726378	5/22/12	Misha Rocks! He is always helpful and energetic. This was one of my best classes at RIT. Highly Recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Misha Makara	5.0	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	5	5	5	2	1726378	9/13/12	Misha is one of those professors that you want to have. He showed extreme interest in the class he taught, but most of all, he made class interesting. Even when the topic was computer policy/ethics. He was never afraid to answer questions, mainly because he has tons of real world experience. You can't beat his humor either. Great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosario Malaver	4.5	2	Spanish		5	5	5	4	1410967	1/27/11	Awesome teacher who is very helpful. There is a lot of homework but she's not a stickler about it as long as you get the material. Wish she taught higher levels of Spanish!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mandrycky	5.0	2	Business		4	5	5	3	1448933	2/9/11	The Careers in Business course was very helpful,professor was knowledgeable & seemed like he wanted us to be successful. His outside HR/recruiting exp was very helpful as it gave me a greater insight to what employers are really looking for. Wish this class was more then 1 credit, that way we can discuss more. Lots of homework, but manageable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mandrycky	5.0	2	Business		4	5	5	3	1448933	1/27/11	Very knowledgeable as a Human Resources manager. Willing to answer any and all questions and truly wants students to do well. Since it's a once-a-week one credit course, though, in the 50 minute class, it's hard to cram everything in!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	1	Engineering	420	3	3	3	2	651768	11/18/09	Decent professor. He definitely takes a lot of time to explain different concepts of Alloy, but often it would be overkill. Also, this class wasn't useful at all: I don't understand what I learned from it. He is a decent guy to talk to if you are concerned about your grade, so go to his office hours if you are running into trouble.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	0	Engineering	350	1	2	2	3	651768	5/20/09	I was hoping this would be a fun class, but as it turns out with Lutz it's the complete opposite. He's an unusually harsh grader, he will take points for very minor almost passable issues. The exams are basically projects you have to complete within 2 hours and they're hard and no type of partial credit whatsoever. I would avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	0	Engineering	361	1	1	1	5	651768	10/31/07	Worst professor ever. Isn't clear with his directions, fails and belittles students. Laughs at your work and it takes a lot of prodding to get suggestions for improvement. Doesn't grade things on time, doesn't hand back suggestions with grades. Would not take his classes ever again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	1	Engineering		3	2	3	4	651768	7/26/06	The textbook taught this class, because with blended learning it makes it even easier for a professor to not interact with students. He was never in his office when he said he would be and rarely handed anything back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	2	Engineering	350	4	3	4	5	651768	5/27/09	Lutz was a pretty good professor, he didn't spend much time explaining the material, but I think that was just how this course is. Grades were fair and timely, practicums were easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	2	Engineering	350	2	5	5	5	651768	4/14/08	I have only had him for Personal SE so far but I was impressed. His office hours were always during class, but my E-mails to him received prompt and helpful response. He is very knowledgable and willing to help during in-class activities. Although he took awhile to grade assignments, his comments really helped me improve. I am taking him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	0	Engineering		3	1	1	3	651768	7/27/06	Poor professor: -Takes forever to grade assignments -Assignment grades are random (whatever he feels like giving you w/ little justification) -Doesn't follow the course grading scheme (says there will be 8 quizzes, only gives you 3) -FLYS through lectures without regard to his students Got a B, but was unimpressed w/ him. Avoid at
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Lutz	2.8	2	Engineering		2	5	3	1	651768	8/12/05	The class was hard but he gave tons of examples and was very willing to explain things. His tests are really brutal though. But he gives lots of other chances to earn points. I got a B. Looks like Milton from Office Space.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	17830	2/27/13	One of the best professors I've had so far at RIT. He has a very strong passion for math, and likes to clearly show why and how everything he teaches works. Takes some getting used to as everything in class is very conceptual, but makes himself very available outside class and encourages questions. Take his class, you will truly learn the content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	17830	5/20/12	I didn't learn anything of use in his class, he never explained why we were doing any of this, and it makes me angry to think of him. Just a lot of unnecessary stress with this class. SKIP!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	17830	4/10/12	Probably the best teacher in the math department if not RIT. It's obvious that he loves teaching and actually takes the time to explain why you need to know the information in the class. Tests and homework are fair with a few difficult problems that test your understanding of the course. I highly recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	2	17830	11/7/11	expect homework due every class, expect random quizzes, expect both of these with notice of under 24 hours via email. quizzes and tests are hard. learn directly from the book. check his website frequently for changes in the homework he may not email the class. without prior knowledge of the subject its very hard to do well unless you study A LOT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	17830	10/25/11	Very helpful and informative teacher. Willing to answer any and all relevant questions in class. Provides a ton of examples and explains every concept thoroughly. Makes class enjoyable. Tests are extremely hard, but if you study well they don't end so badly. Overall, a great teacher. Make sure to DO HOMEWORK and STUDY, STUDY, STUDY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	17830	10/29/10	Best professor I've had so far at RIT. Makes concepts very clear and provides lots of examples. Doesn't just throw formulas at you, he shows you where they come from. Tests are moderately hard but fair. If you like math you'll enjoy his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	281	2	5	4	5	17830	1/27/09	Lutzer is an incredible teacher. The material is sometimes hard but he is always more than happy to slow down and go over something if necessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	281	2	4	4	3	17830	11/19/08	Makes sure people understand. Takes time to explain in and out of class. Tests are difficult but you always know what to expect. Always helpful during workshop and office hours. Gets ticked off easily if you don't work hard during workshop or don't pay attention in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	204	2	5	5	4	17830	5/2/08	Had Prof. Lutzer back in 98 at University of Kentucky. He rocked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	5	5	1	17830	2/14/08	My favorite teacher ever! he is so awesome, he made me look forward to going to math class,MATH CLASS for god's sake.he has a way of making you understand concepts that normally i would simply stare blankly at,if you get the chance to take him i HIGHLY recommend doing so, you wont regret it.But just because hes great doesnt mean the subject is easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	4	4	17830	7/27/12	Class lectures were not boring. The homework is assigned and due almost every class sometimes assigned by email the night before, but he does accept late homework if you get overwhelmed and can't complete it on time. His quizzes are very easy and straightforward if you have been doing the homework and understand the content. Exams are fair.take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	5	17830	5/19/12	A great teacher in terms of learning. Open for office hours, wants to see you learn. If you are looking for an easy A though, you will not get it as his tests/quizzes are very hard. But if you want to know the topic well, take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	3	4	2	17830	11/20/11	Was a great guy, I'd love to know him out of class. His class is great if you already know the material. His teaching is vague and conceptual and his tests and quizzes are outrageously difficult. His grading system only benefits those who are already doing well. Implies false hope by replacing grades with the final then makes final impossibly hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	3	17830	10/31/11	Go to office hours!! He's a good teacher and approachable with any problem. Tests and quizzes are very hard. Study a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	0	Mathematics	282	1	2	2	4	17830	2/15/11	Often skips steps when showing how to solve problems. Uses techniques that are different than what the book has. I went to his office hours often, but I still found the book more helpful than his explanations. He holds high standards for students, so often we work on problems that few of us understand. Class test scores range from 20% to 100%.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	17830	3/13/10	Make sure you study his online book and do the homework and his classes are a breeze. Grades on a monster curve so if you are put in the class with a bunch of idiots you'll do well. Easy A. Had like a 101 going into the final
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	17830	11/30/08	Decent Person but odd teaching method are hard to get used to. Horrid tests and doesn't use the book for homework or lesson plans.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	1	Mathematics	281	2	1	5	5	17830	11/9/08	Helpful and always makes himself available for anyone who needs help. Little getting used to his teaching but once you do it works well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	306	2	5	5	4	17830	2/27/08	Very helpful and open teacher. Very respectful to the students. He does not follow the book always. Sometimes this is good, as his method is a whole lot easier than the book's. He goes over the steps quickly at first because he would rather see people understand whats going on than just writing down notes, but ALWAYS took time to explain if asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	5	5	1	17830	2/12/08	Awesome professor, always had my attention in class. Tests are straight forwards and taught everything you need to know in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		1	5	4	4	17830	7/30/07	I love Luzter he is really great and helpful help me pass math without a doubt and he wasnt even my math teacher he was my fencing teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	17830	11/10/05	well first of all he is a great guy who help me lot of time even when its not his office hours. you will actually learn in his class, he makes math fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	3	17830	10/19/05	Don't take him. He will help you, but thinks too much of being a "husband, and a father" such he will just leave after office hours, and not stay a min later. Go find someone else, like Lorenzo.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	17830	9/25/05	Wow, I've never seen so much emotion put into math. Its great, and he is very helpful when needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	17830	7/26/05	Very Difficult, but you will KNOW linear algebra. He is a very excellent teacher and I would highly recommend taking this class if you ever get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	NULL	17830	2/19/03	Somehow made math fun! Hoo-yah!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Lutzer	3.9	2	Mathematics	432	1	5	5	4	17830	5/1/07	Amazing. Period. End of discussion.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Lyons	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		1	5	5	5	590125	8/2/06	everybody's favorite teacher. the dude ROCKS. but he's not easy. learned a lot about myself, and what I'm really good at. he really cares about his students, and helps you understand your career options. wish I had him before senior year. my book improved muuuuuuuucho grande from working w/this guy. thanks chris. you're awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Lyons	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	590125	4/3/05	Very straight forward, very down to earth. Class was informative and helpful. Chris is highly recommended, and a nice guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Lyons	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	590125	9/29/05	he knows what he's talking about. he does not allow people to make excuses for****ty/unfinished work. he is extremely critical and pushes you to work your hardest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English	103	2	4	4	2	70332	3/20/11	She's really nice, likes it if you actively participate. She actually reads essays, so if you aren't a good writer or don't like to spend time on your writing, she may not be for you. Her classes are interesting and informative, and she's very funny though a little odd!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English	319	5	5	5	4	70332	2/21/09	lots of reading to do, but all in all a great course and good prof. interesting, good discussions, and not a harsh grader. highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	0	English		2	1	1	2	70332	2/7/07	This lady is crazy. She is deaf and is denying it. She makes everything harder than it has to be. It may partially be the course in and of itself, but this teacher didn't help at all. Every question was answered with "just look it up in the book". The smallest things wrong with a paper would get you at least a B if not worse; depending on her mood.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	1	English		3	2	4	5	70332	5/5/06	Her exams were very easy, however she graded the papers too harshly. She was not a very nice person she would say really mean things to students, but in a nice way? and she even made me cry :-(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		5	5	5	2	70332	12/6/05	Good teacher, easy class. I'd recommend her for writing if you don't like the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		4	5	4	4	70332	3/3/05	She knows her stuff, she's very interesting and insightful. Class is pretty easy and always good discussion. Williing to help outside of class. HIGHLY recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		4	5	5	1	70332	10/20/04	She's a very nice person, and a great teacher. I enjoy going to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	1	English		2	1	4	NULL	70332	5/6/04	Be prepared to work if you want to do well in this class. She is a hard essay grader. Quizzes are easy if you read the books( sparknotes will not help ). Very difficult teacher to approach and lectures are more like a verbal assault. Slackers beware
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		4	5	5	NULL	70332	10/22/03	One of my favorite teachers. I have always hated english and writing but I liked this class. Thanks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		3	4	4	3	70332	12/1/10	She is hilarious, but is also deaf(ish). take her if you dont want a wiener for a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English	227	5	4	4	2	70332	2/6/08	awesome! had her for writing seminar and she was great... we read one, surprisingly very interesting book, and shes incredibly easy. do the work and you'll do well... usually can leave class early. i wish she was my grandma, shes so nice :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	0	English		4	2	2	1	70332	5/21/06	I did not enjoy this class at all. I think it was more the subject and teaching style then the teacher herself. She is a very nice person. Don't take this class unless you like nature and like reading and writing about it, otherwise you will find it boring and pointless
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	1	English		2	4	2	2	70332	4/16/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		3	4	4	1	70332	5/12/05	A good teacher, quizes were a joke u can not read and still get 100 she gades papaer kinda hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		4	5	5	2	70332	11/29/04	overall very pleased w/ her. just read the books (or movie if possible), take the easy quizzes(7), and write her papers(5). no final! quizzes are easy, and she grades fair on the papers. got an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		5	5	4	NULL	70332	5/7/04	I didn't go to this class for a month, and got a B, as long as you read the books, take the quizzes, and get your easily graded papers in by the end of the semester youll end up with a decent grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Barbara MacCameron	3.9	2	English		3	4	5	NULL	70332	2/19/04	Fair grader and good teacher....much better than most writign and lit teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 MacGregor	5.0	2	History	444	4	5	5	3	958824	5/13/09	Professor MacGregor is a fantastic professor. He is very interesting and makes history fun. You will really get a kick out of his class and you will learn a lot. Just make sure you go to class. He only gives 3 grades in the entire class which are tests (essay format). He also gives outside reading, which is not necessary to do well in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 MacGregor	5.0	2	History	488	4	5	5	5	958824	2/15/07	I had Dr. MacGregor for Modern America and Modern Germany. He has a very straight forward teahing style, very clear as to what to study for the tests, (which are essay style). But there are no other assignments that count towards your Grade so you have to do good on the tests! But better than most other history teachers Ive had at rit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	1019047	4/6/13	Best Professor Yet, Tells alot of jokes but you have to be paying attention to hear him. Grades fairly and all HW, quizzes, and tests are all fair questions. Recommended for Electronics 1 at least
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	482	2	5	5	4	1019047	12/17/10	In 2003, Dr. Madhu's grading style was very...precise (Something like two missed homework assignments meant a 0 for the entire homework grade). Nevertheless, he was a great lecturer and his strict grading style motivated me to learn the material. I remember him as being one of the best professors at RIT. Also, he's hilarious if you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	1	Electrical Engineering	382	3	3	3	5	1019047	1/31/10	Professor is a tough grader for tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	292	3	5	5	5	1019047	9/6/08	Amazing teacher! Amazing guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	101	2	5	5	5	1019047	11/10/11	Probably the best Electrical Engineering professor ever at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	381	2	5	4	2	1019047	8/5/10	Funny old man, made a lot of side comments and sarcastic remarks that had me laughing. Pretty decent teacher. Good at explaining. HW is worth ~17.6% of your final grade, he emails the answers out the night before it is due, and is lenient about due dates. Exams problems are very similar to HW, no surprises.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	382	4	4	4	4	1019047	5/19/09	Good prof
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swaminathan Madhu	4.5	2	Electrical Engineering	481	3	5	4	5	1019047	10/10/07	Great guy. Gives plenty of examples and explains material very well. Has an interesting sense of humor. Lenient about due dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean-Louise Mahar	3.2	2	Writing		5	4	5	1	1187482	5/10/12	I've taken two courses with this professor and they are by far the easiest online courses I've ever taken. Whoever said they're challenging must be challenged themselves. Write 1 page paper a week and 3 discussion posts and you've got an A. By far the easiest courses I've taken and she is a really nice person as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean-Louise Mahar	3.2	1	Writing	325	3	3	2	2	1187482	10/25/10	I took Comm In Bus online. I didn't like the grading system to much. One point deduction is a whole 20% off your grade. She assigned a chapter to read every week so make sure you like to read and like teh subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean-Louise Mahar	3.2	1	Writing	227	4	2	4	2	1187482	11/19/08	Relatively easy to BS, taught the material okay, but there wasn't much material. Very basic writing skills required. Should be a 9th grade teacher. Seemed under-qualified.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean-Louise Mahar	3.2	0	Writing		3	1	3	2	1187482	1/31/11	Very harsh grader, takes points off if ur wrong with grammar or if u don't use the correct edition of the book. Class average was in the 60's, and didn't respond to e-mail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jean-Louise Mahar	3.2	2	Writing		5	4	4	1	1187482	2/4/09	If you like writing about Technology, Business, and health she is the one for you. But if you are creative and uninterested in those subjects it is HORRIBLE!! She goes over grammar every class, it is at 8am and she yells at you if you blink for to long (claiming that you are sleeping).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	101	4	4	4	3	1272876	10/28/12	Good professor, very helpful and lenient with assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	5	5	1272876	10/26/11	Great teacher, looking forward to having him again next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	232	4	5	5	5	1272876	11/17/09	He is a great teacher, always helpful, very helpful. And tests are not hard, also he is not strict on grades. Recomend this professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	1272876	5/1/12	Great teacher for beginning circuits. Understands the difficulty in getting used to circuit theory and compensates for grades. So long as you show an interest in the work and try your best your likely to get a reasonable grade. Labs are a little bit difficult, but not too much so.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering	337	5	5	5	5	1272876	2/11/10	Amazing class amazing teaching, but you have to have interest in the the subject or you wont enjoy it as much
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eldred Majors	4.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	4	5	1272876	4/16/09	I really liked him, he was clear and helpful. His tests were never too hard and he was a very fair grader. He also is willing to curve if grades are bad. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1629847	10/11/12	Always willing to help and answer questions. Very clear, follows the textbook, and helpful during workshop since she will tell you how to complete the problem and basically give you the answer. Homework sometimes eats up a lot of time. Quizzes every week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	5	2	1629847	4/26/12	An excellent teacher, very clear and understandable. Her homeworks are pretty long, but they are good preparation for her tests. She's very nice as well, and useful for extra help, and she actually seems to care whether or not people understand what she teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1629847	2/22/12	She's really nice, makes sure to explain everything. Uses MyCourses, tests are very fair, no suprises, questions just like homework problems. Available for office hours, really takes feedback from students seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	1629847	5/21/12	take good notes, pay attention to examples in class. she is extremely helpful at office hours, i recommend going to them as much as possible. homework is difficult but quizzes and tests are fairly easy if you understand the concepts
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	3	1629847	2/23/12	Her home works are next to impossible because you don't learn the material until weeks later. Quizzes every week and 3 exams when all other professors only give two. The third was more like a final and dropped my grade a letter. She doesn't listen to feed back and she formulates excuses. She seems nice but she's sneaky. Do not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kara Maki	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	1629847	10/23/11	Very Nice Teacher.She works with the students to make sure they understand the material. Goes fast. Understanding and kind as a person. Highly Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Manchee	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	1003729	5/23/11	one of the best professors out there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Manchee	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	5	1003729	8/7/08	Good teacher, helpful if you want to listen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Manchee	4.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	3	1003729	4/29/10	Doug is a great teacher. His critiques are fun and instructive and it is incredibly convenient to have your professor also be the head of your department. He once gave my entire class A's because the infamou james schuck was fired halfway through teaching the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Mangan	3.5	2	Chemistry	205	3	4	4	4	1621931	5/30/12	This guy really knows what he's doing. He really will try to help you understand the material if you actually put some effort into the lab. Fair grader and friendly. If you put decent effort into the class, you won't get a bad grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Mangan	3.5	2	Chemistry		2	3	4	3	1621931	10/28/11	Teacher at first was difficult to deal with, but if you ask questions and put actual effort into your lab and show understanding, you will do well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Mangan	3.5	2	Chemistry	205	3	5	4	4	1621931	2/21/12	Hot. As. Balls. also, he's good if you listen to what he says and put in at least minimum work. He wants you to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Mangan	3.5	0	Chemistry		1	2	2	2	1621931	10/17/11	Do not get this professor, he takes off points for pointless things and it is hard to get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	301	5	4	5	4	994934	5/22/11	Mapes was a great prof, it was obvious she knew the material very well. Makes it clear what the student needs to do. If you read and can write well on the tests (all essay) then youll do fine. Nice overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	401	2	5	5	3	994934	11/22/10	Terrific class and professor. Combo of lecture and discussion. Very enthusiastic and really cares if the students learn. A lot of work writing but worth it. Definitely one of the best profs I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	301	2	5	5	3	994934	11/18/10	Great professor!!! Really knows her stuff.She has really interesting lectures and makes history fun to study. I especially liked the reading and the discussions. She wants to hear what we think. . Her tests can be hard but they are fair. All in all a great class and a great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	0	History		5	2	2	2	994934	5/12/10	Took Women's History. Grades are participation, journals about reading, and a long final paper. Class was easy, but really useless - you never are tested on material and just have to spit up a page of information every week from skimming a reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History		2	4	4	4	994934	3/4/10	Easy enough class if you do the work. Read the chapter before every quiz and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History		4	3	4	3	994934	2/1/10	Grade based on weekly quizzes from textbook reading which isn't bad, participation in class discussions, midterm/final. Tells you what to expect on midterm/final. Overall good teacher, a bit boring at times but knows what she is talking about. Make sure you do the reading for the quizzes and you'll get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History		4	5	5	5	994934	10/27/07	Really interesting material and easy assignments (weekly reading reports and a paper), but her discussions were excruciating. Other than that great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	301	4	3	5	3	994934	2/2/11	A fairly easy class (the only grades are a few quizzes, based on books and 2 tests based off the lectures). The only problem is the lectures are boring, she has trouble keeping the class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	301	3	4	5	3	994934	11/21/10	Overall Prof. Mapes made this a good class. It required a lot of reading and a lot of memorization to do really well on the tests (2 essay questions, 3 short answer), but as long as you read the required chapters and take good notes it's not bad. The class mostly consists of lecture so that was boring, but sometimes we got to watch documentaries.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	0	History	301	3	2	2	3	994934	5/19/10	Quizzes unrelated to lecture. Lecture is boring, textbook is all primary sources. Do not take unless you feel like being quizzed on material completely unrelated to the lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	1	History		3	2	4	2	994934	5/11/10	Good teacher in my opinion. Tests were easy to study for as long as you read the text. My only complaint would be the apparently hard grading on paper and final. Before final and paper I had an A after apparently It dropped to a C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	210	4	4	5	1	994934	3/2/10	I'm a physics major with no interest in history. She kept my interest enough to get an A in the course. She made history bearable, even at 6-8pm. That speaks to her quality as a teacher. Do the reading, take notes and join in discussions and you will succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History		5	3	5	1	994934	3/18/08	Boring class, but that isn't to say that she does a bad job teaching it. Very good teacher in that she tested on exactly what she lectures on in class, and told the class what would be on the midterm/final. I rarely got full credit on journal entries though, and NEVER got any useful feedback. Still, a relatively easy upper-level lib arts class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Mapes	4.0	2	History	402	5	5	5	4	994934	8/22/07	Take good notes and you'll get a 100 on everything. Very knowledgeable and very eager to share info to the class. Do the readings and take notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	52261	3/16/12	Very good professor, goes over the material well, does a lot of examples on the board and goes over the solutions in detail. Homework is not collected and he's a very fair grader. He gives quite a bit of partial credit. He gave my class 2 tests instead of 3 like most calc professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	52261	1/3/12	he is funny and smart.He is extremely helpful and makes you cannot live without math.He doesn't want students to use calculator i like this cause I don't like to use calculator.easy grader.clever teaching and flexible with anything
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	52261	9/8/11	Nicest and most helpful teacher I had at RIT so far. He is more then willing to help you if you don't understand. He's definitely not the easiest teacher but it's not hard to pass his class at all. DEFINITELY recommend him. He's my favorite teacher. He LOVES classic rock and loves to talk about music if you want to get on his good side!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics	282	3	4	5	4	52261	2/2/11	Teaches at a very slow pace. He's very approachable and helpful but the material is presented slowly and carefully. Some classes we barely made it through 2 examples in an hour. This can be a blessing or a curse. It's all about your style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics	328	4	4	4	4	52261	8/21/10	I had Engineering Mathematics with Professor Marengo for the 20094 quarter. I found him to be a very good professor. I loved to explain the topics beyond what the book cover. He often repeated himself, to make sure you got the point. He was very interested in getting the students to succeed. No attendance, homework not graded (bad for me).
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	3	52261	10/14/08	Extremely boring and frustrating. If you learn at a slow pace he's great but if you know what you're doing you'll just pull your hair out, he repeats things way too much. Only went to one hour of each lecture and did fine the other lecture is just a repeat of the first, his tests and stuff aren't too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	5	52261	10/20/05	Insane. Very. I learned way too much about Calc in that class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	4	52261	3/1/05	Pros: VERY easy grader, nice guy Cons: extremely boring, tests are on the difficult side, doesn't seem very organized. I personally didn't get anything from his lectures - I might as well not have ever gone to class! Take him if you are good at learning the material on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	NULL	52261	5/10/04	Stresses common themes, never changes the way he presents material or the way he approaches the problems so students learn. Sometimes it gets a little dry and tiring, but its worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	52261	2/19/03	very fair, will help you if you ask
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics	283	3	5	4	2	52261	3/13/12	GREAT PROFESSOR! He is extremely helpful and makes sure you understand everything before moving on. I would recommend him to everyone. His tests go hand in hand with what he teaches in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics	412	2	5	5	4	52261	11/7/11	Great professor! He knows the material in great depth and is willing to explain it to you. He does get really close if you don't speak loud enough so really project your questions. Funny enthusiastic and clear professor. He is slow so bring the text and stay ahead if you tend to get bored the tests are hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics	359	1	5	4	2	52261	7/7/11	Teaches laboriously slowly. Assigns brutal homework problems. Elaborate test questions involving several weeks of content. This guy was born to be an Honors professor. You will learn, oh, you WILL learn. I think everyone got Cs or lower on every homework and every test, but I had a B, and others got As. Honors classes are so weird.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	52261	10/20/10	Dr. Marengo is an excellent teacher. He goes slowly, but you learn the background of everything. He is great at breaking problems down and explaining each step, how to do it, and why you can. You will learn the subject inside and out. He has a hearing problem, especially with women's voices, so don't be offended if he doesn't understand you!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	1	52261	11/30/08	Sometimes the material was dry but he did his best to keep it interesting. Didn't take attendance, didn't collect homework. Tests and quizzes were fair and enough time was given. Is very helpful during office hours if you need them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	52261	5/21/06	Sometimes he has trouble understanding students questions, but I thought that he explained things pretty well overall. A really nice guy. He gives you partial credit on quiz and exam questions based on your work, so that is really cool. His notes that he writes on the board are very neat, organized , and clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	52261	6/29/05	Best for the person who's an independent learner. Doesn't hold your hand but presents well. Can be quiet, try sitting closer to the board. Easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	52261	10/27/04	He is one of the best math teachers. Will make you feel like a mathematician. very smart, and always knows the answer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	5	3	NULL	52261	3/8/04	My Grade: C. Dr. Marengo was very helpful. Though he wasn't always easy, he thoroughly explained everything. His grading was pretty liberal (lots of partial credit).
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Marengo	4.2	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	NULL	52261	5/14/02	Talks to the board all the time, class falls asleep, boring, easy to get lost
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		5	4	4	4	512579	1/25/07	Great professor. Explains material well. Gets off on amusing tangents quite often, but it still able to teach the material effectively. Overall rating: A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	3	512579	7/27/06	While it's true that this guy knows his stuff, do NOT take him for an introductory class, especially if you have had no previous programming experience before RIT; he'll go way over your head with tons of details that aren't really relevant to beginners.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	512579	10/25/05	Helpful and really knows his stuff. Excellent professor. :-D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	512579	1/26/05	Best CS Professor. Ya knows everything. Likes to mention interesting things beyond the normal curriculum. Tests are standard CS tests. Reasonable grader, helpful with projects and anything else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	3	512579	10/11/06	He is an awesome professor. Really knows a great deal. He's also got a good sense of humour. You will never be bored in his class. ^_^
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	512579	3/12/06	Since I am not C++ expert, I can only say that he sounds like he knows his stuff. The class is hard to manage with at first; it's all "we will go over _ later" but gets better later on. You will probably learn more from the labs and use that information to ask questions in class. Notes are usually of little help. Willing to help though. Grades fair
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	512579	5/1/05	Great sense of humor. Teaches to the C++ specification itself, this man knows everything you could want to know about C++. Easy grader on the CS4 project. Really helpful on the project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sydney Marshall	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	512579	11/27/04	Great Professor. Dry, but hilarious sense of humor. Always fair. The guy has so much experience in the field it's mind-boggling. Tests and assignments are straightforward or easy. Oh yeah, he knows everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly Martin	4.6	2	Communication		5	5	5	3	1640469	4/26/12	Took public speaking with Professor Martin and enjoyed every minute of it. She's still new to RIT (and teaching in general) but she truly cares that you learn and does her best to explain the material to you. Very helpful. Would recommend for anyone interested in Communication courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly Martin	4.6	2	Communication		5	5	4	4	1640469	11/14/11	Very friendly. Really cares that students learn. She is younger, and still learning, but someday she will be a great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly Martin	4.6	2	Communication	462	4	5	3	3	1640469	11/17/11	Really helpful and definitely willing to make sure you do well in the class. A new professor so a little nervous but cut her some slack. You'll learn if you just respect her. She'll be a great professor someday. She's actually really interested in making sure her students are successful in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly Martin	4.6	2	Communication		5	5	5	5	1640469	11/9/11	She is so nice! Great professor, very easy to understand. She is extremely approachable and willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Martins	2.5	1	Writing		4	3	2	3	1602447	11/24/11	Cares a lot about students grades, and will spend a lot of time explaining what he wants in assignments if you ask. If you don't ask, is very confusing and you may find yourself being lost. He is willing to change up the class for his students, and does a great job moving class along. I learned a LOT about writing and overall, a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Martins	2.5	1	Writing	455	4	2	3	3	1602447	7/27/11	Seems like a good teacher in the beginning but doesn't give you any indication of your grade until the end. Most assignments are pass/fail except for one paper worth half your grade and you can only do well if you write it exactly the way he wants it. Don't take this class (Writing the self and others) or this teacher. Stupid class, bad teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	4	5	4	4	886402	11/13/08	He's not bad, lectures are just powerpoints, and time is given every class to work with teams on the project. The documentation is the most important part, just make sure to ask him to clarify what he expects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	3	5	5	5	886402	11/9/08	Excellent professor. He provides real world examples in class that help you become a better software engineer. He is really critical about documentation, so make sure you proofread your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	3	5	5	3	886402	2/4/08	Professor Mason explains the material well almost to the point where you don't need the textbook (that's up to you if you buy the textbook or not). He's very approachable and friendly so if you have any questions he'll be ready to answer them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	3	5	5	5	886402	11/9/08	Excellent professor. He provides excellent real world examples to help you become a better software engineer. He also provides good advice on how to become a good project manager.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	4	5	5	5	886402	4/14/08	Really good at 361. When we had issues with JUnit he said that he does not do coding. Lectures are really good, he is very enthusiastic, and his criticisms are helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Mason	4.7	2	Computer Science	361	4	4	3	4	886402	9/4/06	This comment may be slightly inaccurate, as I am mainly just adding this new professor to the database. Mason teaches in the Software Engineering department, and I had him for SE361. First impressions of him are good, will post again towards the end of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	0	Mathematics	232	1	1	1	1	179428	1/31/11	I would not recommend him to anybody! I didn't learn a thing from him all year. His notes and lecture are useless. Bad teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	1	Mathematics	101	1	2	3	1	179428	12/2/09	For Data Analysis; very nice will help you on anything. Lets you have your notes when taking exams. However, he draws random objects on the board and he tells jokes that is not realizable to the subject. Be prepare to be confuse.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	179428	11/18/08	Doesn't explain concepts clearly, unable to properly answer questions in a manner more clear then his original explanation. Class is rushed because he tries to (and fails) cover a years worth of material in one quarter. Tries to make up for failure to teach by having open notes/book tests including the final. Won't work with struggling students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	0	Mathematics	226	2	2	1	2	179428	1/24/08	Worst professor ever... Disorganized and incomprehensible to those of us who can't do algebra in our heads. Does not use a systematic approach for teaching, rather works out problems leaving the observer to largely guess what procedures he's using. Arghh! Tells funny jokes but who cares!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	3	179428	10/21/06	open book/notebook tests help, but not very good at explaining things
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	179428	2/28/06	awsome teacher, very nice he is an easy grader and easy to learn from, highly recomended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	NULL	179428	5/15/04	He is really nice and helpful, exams are open notes/books. Makes everything easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics	319	3	4	4	3	179428	9/7/10	Class is rushed and confusing. Lets you use notes on tests though, which helped. But its not easy to find info flipping through 10 packets of notes during tests. Mason is bearable and passable, but his jokes are pretty bad. p.s. He's really old
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	1	Mathematics	232	2	4	2	4	179428	10/27/09	knows the material but goes very fast. willing to stay after but you are better off taking other professors because he grades very hard. You will learn stuff but if you take another professor you will learn it and get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics	252	4	5	4	2	179428	6/25/08	Had him for Elementary Calculus and he was great. He is always willing to help you and if you dont understand how to do the basic Algebra he will go over it with you. Open note quizzes are a major help and he let us do corrections to to get some extra points on all handed in assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	1	179428	10/23/07	he's a nice teacher. moves pretty quickly but willing to take time to explain things to you if you ask. tests are open notes/textbook
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	179428	3/12/06	Horrible Teacher. He has to have open book/open notes test to make up for how bad of a teacher he is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics	232	4	5	5	5	179428	5/1/05	He is a great professor. Open book/notes exams are very helpful, and he is very helpful if you have any questions. I HIGHLY reccommend him for any math-related course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sterling Mason	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	179428	4/3/03	He is the best!!! So nice professor, also his teaching is so clear/easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	3	985425	3/16/13	Cool guy. Keeps it interesting. Not too much workload. As an introvert, I disagree with the below reviewer saying the class is uncomfortable for introverts. You can speak up one time per class and get full credit, which is perfectly reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	211	4	5	5	3	985425	11/9/11	You knew what to expect every class. Examples were good and clear. Participation is necessary for a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	5	985425	5/9/11	Great teacher, awesome class. If you're interested in ethics, I would definitely reccommend it. Saturday mornings are a bit tough, but worth it IMO!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	101	5	4	4	2	985425	5/23/10	Cool and entertaining guy. Made a relatively boring class enjoyable. If you want an A, study the answers to the homework questions (which he gives you in class). That's pretty much all that's on the tests. Easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	1	Philosophy		5	3	3	3	985425	5/16/09	Not bad at teaching. He always gave me hard times to make perfect opinions that should be matched with his opinions. That's all you can do is completing questions and read the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	0	Philosophy	202	1	2	2	1	985425	1/30/09	he is a horrible teacher. He has one test and if you do bad, your done for, also his class is boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	100	4	5	5	2	985425	5/1/07	Good professor. Questions on exams are straight out of the workbook. As long as you attend class & pay attention you'll do well in the course. Class is fun & interesting-- the professor does a great job of explaining concepts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	1	Philosophy		2	4	2	1	985425	6/10/12	Very predictable, not much room for opinions. Didn't run the course in a way that was comfortable for introverts. Four hours on a Saturday is unpleasant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy		4	3	4	3	985425	10/24/11	Some people are misled to think that, since this is a liberal arts fluff class, any old answer to a question will do. This isn't the case in Mathers's Intro to Ethics. While you needn't agree with him on moral issues (he doesn't make his opinion known), he expects you to find certain flaws in certain arguments, etc. Overall, a good teacher, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	1	Philosophy	101	3	2	3	1	985425	10/16/10	The class is easy if you have a tolerance for it. Four hours of ethics on saturday mornings is pretty rough. Descriptions are unnecessarily long and his word rules. You dont get room for an oppinion here. He makes his class rules very clear and they show no tolerance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	1	Philosophy		4	3	3	2	985425	10/7/09	Colin is a good teacher. Easy to get an A if you attend class and take notes. Homework is to read a chapter and ask questions in a packet he gives. You get extra points for answering questions in class and attending in general. 2 exams - questions come from packet given to you prior to exam. Take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	4	985425	2/18/09	Awesome, easy teacher. Show up, read the textbook, do the questions and you'll get an A. The tests are made of the questions you've already answered - just study those and you'll do fine. Also a really interesting teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colin Mathers	3.9	2	Philosophy	211	4	4	5	2	985425	11/3/08	Mathers is an excellent professor. He is very clear and comprehesible. He does not grade harshly and is very open to help out with assignments. The textbook is used for about half of the work done. The other half comes from discussions in the lecture. I recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	2	67409	3/11/06	he really explains the problems and made math clear to me! I hate math and dont understand it at all and I passed with a B! Open book and can have a cheat sheet note for tests. Multi choice problems are hard though. use online site to practice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	67409	11/11/05	I passed the course with an A,,, but I had to study,,, my friend mario says he is going to pass it with an A,,, lets hope he studies and not listen to the suggestions on this site,, saying its so easy !!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67409	9/19/05	He goes where no other teachers go. He teaches further into the book than the school requires and yet still makes the information understandable and easy to digest. It's like magic!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67409	8/8/04	Best math professor I have had in my life. Very good at "teaching" and not just telling.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	67409	2/28/06	He knows how to teach the material clearly as possible. Open book, closed notes, calculator are allowed during quizes and exams. I received B in this class which I think is fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	2	67409	10/18/05	Easiest guy ever, and P&S1 is an easy class anyway, open book, open notes, any calculator, which on one of his (SHORT) tests means you can basically get an A with minimal effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	2	67409	12/2/04	Awesome teacher, allows open-book exams ALONG with cheat sheets. Very helpful with questions and geniunely wants everyone to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Mathiason	4.8	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67409	3/9/03	Very very very very good teacher. He can make the stupidest person in the class learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jan Maneti	4.5	2	Engineering		5	5	4	5	1695904	11/2/12	He's a really nic guy, very helpful. Gives out A's as long as your part isn't completely wrong. All my grades have been 97s and 100s.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Manning	1.6	0	Business	220	3	1	1	5	1113578	11/11/08	an unfortuante experience by far. not sure why he handed out a syllabus, bc we never followed it. his lectures were irrelevent, ambiguous, and extremely unorganized. his inconsistency between actual and espoused expectations create many challanges that may otherwise be avoided. never available outside of class. do all that you can to avoid him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Manning	1.6	0	Business	101	1	1	1	1	1113578	11/10/08	Dr. Manning is an embarrassment to RIT's academic standards. Worst instructor in my entire college career due to his lack of organization, clarity, relevant course instruction, scatterbrained/inconsistent lectures/exams, terribly ambiguous/deficient projects (based on material NOT covered), and unwilling to help students with their questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Manning	1.6	0	Business	320	3	2	2	3	1113578	11/11/08	I took corporate finance with Manning and honestly left it learning very little from him. I used primarily my textbook and the text slides as well as teachings from the many substitutes we had. He was very inconsistent, disorganized, and clearly cannot teach. He was also absent frequently. I would NOT recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Manning	1.6	1	Business		2	2	3	4	1113578	5/21/08	Guy was late to class every single week, sometimes as late as 45 minutes. Does not answer emails, and waited until the end of the quarter to grade EVERYTHING. I didn't do so well on the projects and it is his fault that I didn't get them back sooner so I could correct my mistakes. This guy stinks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67408	2/24/11	She's really great teacher. You'll be so lucky if you get her for data analysis 1. She's absolutely great at teaching this material and extremely helpful with the material. She's tough grader but it's fascinating how her grading helps me do even better. you'll do great if you take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	2	67408	1/23/11	So sweet, writes everything you need on the board so take good notes. Very helpful. Highly Recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	4	1	67408	10/19/10	great teacher. kinda does treat class like high school but sometimes that can be helpful. very friendly and patient. i would take her again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	2	67408	3/3/08	Carol is a nice lady, the class i didn't think was all that difficult...that being said, i didn't really do too well. Her grading is VERY tough...(taking .1 off for not rounding to the nearest ones place). She does grade harshly but wants you to do well (i think). She was very available to students and was helpful when answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	1	Mathematics		3	2	4	1	67408	2/20/06	She has a unique way of teaching which is nice, its not your average drone on teacher, not as helpful as I would had liked but she did try give a hand or two. She is more concerned about her personal life than helping students out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	67408	11/24/05	Pretty easy class. She really makes it so students soak up the material. She can be a little tricky on t/f questions though. Take her if you have the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	67408	11/5/03	Very good teacher..had her for Data Analysis I and she explained everything..made the material easy to understand and notes are very helpful...tests are not hard if you study and know the material...I would recommend her to anyone that can take her....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	5	67408	1/26/11	My favourite professor that I've ever had. I would take her again for DA2 if I could. Very very sweet, very clear, very helpful, and loves her students. She actually learned some sign language too so she could connect with her deaf students! Take her if you can. This class was super easy for me (97%), but then again my friends did struggle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	3	67408	10/29/10	DATA ANALYS. I: Fairly easy to understand, easy A if you come to class. Unique character though, she looks and acts like a sims character in terms of expression, and I cant help but see the green diamond over her head as she explains something, but she's a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	67408	3/17/08	I really enjoyed having her as a teacher. The information was very easy to learn. She would spend the first hour teaching the material and the second hour we did worksheets. The class never got boring, and its not hard to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	3	67408	1/15/07	Ok teacher, but treats students like high-school kids. We had an assignment which involved counting M&Ms. Also, tends to grade far to strictly on tests when it comes to details. as in, when using a calculator, she expects you to write down which buttons you pressed. If you're the type of kid who likes banana stickers on your tests, then go for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	67408	1/27/06	She's one of those soccer-mom highschool-teacher kinda woman. I had her for a 10am class in which she would give out a quiz every class. Also, if you're late, she wont let you make up for it. Very nice and everything, but shes gives a very unprofessional feel to the class which impacted my interest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Marchetti	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	NULL	67408	5/7/04	Probably the best Statistics professor. She explains the material well, is always willing to answer questions, and is very helpful. She will really make you learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering		4	4	4	2	222862	5/21/12	nice teacher and likes to help, going into his office and getting help will help a lot. make sure you are comfortable with working in groups for fundamentals, it's a big part of the grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering		4	4	5	1	222862	9/5/08	The class material is boring as hell, and that's 90% of the problem. There's simply no substance to eng econ - it's dry as heck. Though he tries real hard to make it some-what interesting - a feat in itself. Not much homework, and tests are fair..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering		2	5	5	3	222862	2/26/08	Had him for Engineering Economics, Ergonomics, and SQC. Didn't like a lot of the material, but he is a great teacher! He gives super clear notes and is very clear and flexible on when homework is due and test schedule. Love him!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering		3	4	4	2	222862	10/14/08	Very good teacher. Does the best he can with boring material. Gives a lot of notes in class. Very helpful out of class. Makes himself very available outside of class for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering		4	4	4	1	222862	6/3/08	The class material itself is boring as hell, but he himself is a good teacher. Assigns a fair amount of homework, tests aren't too bad. Just do the homework (which is like 10-15 problems every 2 weeks) and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Marshall	4.4	2	Engineering	520	4	5	5	2	222862	10/13/06	He's both helpful and available to answer questions, and does a great job of presenting material that can sometimes get pretty dry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	513069	10/4/11	He taught the material thoroughly and really knew his stuff. OFfice hours visits helped with understanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	513069	11/20/05	He is a good teacher if you are willing to learn on your own and read the book. His tests were curved a lot so you could get an 70-80% on the test and still get an A. The tests were not that bad either. Homework was not graded, but it is very helpful for the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	3	513069	11/7/05	He teach like he is being torture. I have a tough time understanding the lesson. When I ask question, I never get the answer back .. really, instead I get more confused. And when I transfer to CS major, I have suffered alot in discrete 2 as the consequences. Well, all in short, I would avoid if it come to discrete with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	1	513069	7/23/05	I thought this guy was great, wonderful teaching style and easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	1	Mathematics	204	3	3	3	1	513069	2/5/05	He was a younger guy, funny, joked with the students. He taught like he was being tortured. Like he really wanted to teach a more advanced class but he got the short end of the stick and was forced to teach alg. and trig. I felt like I was being tortured to so I never went to class still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	3	513069	11/28/04	Tony is a nice guy, but i really had trouble understanding his discriptions and explanations, and repeatedly had to learn from the book instead. Most of the people in the class did manage to get an A, as he graded pretty easy, but I found the class overall hard because of presentation, not content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	513069	8/11/06	A nice guy but a little dull at times. We had a fair share of in class demonstrations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	513069	11/12/05	He is a good guy, will answer any question you have, but in his own way. His teaching style is really hard to get used to. I guess he grades really easilly because the class average sucks, and if the class average sucks it can only be blamed on the teacher. Beware of Tony
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	2	513069	10/23/05	I had a tough time understanding him. I would reccommend someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Martellotta	3.4	2	Mathematics		5	3	5	2	513069	6/14/05	He does teach liek he's being tortured. He seemed to be nice enough and I assume would have answered questions if you needed help.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	2	Computer Science	456	3	5	5	5	1044256	9/17/12	One of the best members of the SE department. He is clear, understandable, and fair in grading. The project could use a little bit of improvement and was overly ambiguous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	2	4	1044256	5/21/12	Easily one of the worst professors I've had at RIT. He preaches about the 80/20 principle, but doesn't practice it in teaching the course. Exams are unreasonably difficult only because we're not explicitly told what to study. I was very interested in Software Process, but this professor completely destroyed my interest in the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	4	1044256	4/17/10	Awful professor. In order to even pass the course you have to quote the book, he takes off lots of points even if your answer is completely correct but not word-for-word what the book says. Questions also have a lot of hidden meaning, he doesn't ask the questions for the answers he expects. Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science	361	1	2	2	5	1044256	1/22/10	So harsh and unfair! All he cares about is buzzwords and he likes to pick on random people in class. He just gave our team a 70% in a easy project because he didn't like our (perfectly reasonable) variable names, and he finds every little flaw to pick apart. One kid in our group has a stutter and he took off half a letter for that! AVOID HIM!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	1	Computer Science	361	2	3	3	3	1044256	1/28/09	He is good at lecturing. However, he is a harsh grader. Asks a lot. thinks that whole your life is his class. grades slowly and cuts a lot of points for nothing. Definitely, suggest to not take him if you have a chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science	361	3	1	1	2	1044256	9/22/08	Martinez is absolutely unreasonable and hypocritical. Expecting all assignments to be turned in by the deadline with absolutely no exceptions, he himself fails to return graded assignments within the time frame that he promises. Additionally, when he fails to clarify an assignment's due date he assumes no responsibility.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science	361	2	1	2	1	1044256	2/29/08	Terrible teaching style, very unfair grading. Worst experience of my RIT career so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	2	3	1044256	5/26/12	Martinez was unusually harsh in providing feedback. Also the problem seemed to that he took a hands off approach this time, but failed to provide any kind of aid when some signs of distress were shown. Even if the sponsor is happy with the project he would only focus on what went wrong than what went right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	2	1044256	4/27/10	The Buzzword king!! Still takes points off even if you have the right answer. He just reads off of slides and picks on random people for his own pleasure. He is also unhelpful outside of class. Final verdict: avoid like the plague!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	3	3	1044256	2/15/10	Horrible experience, very negative in his feedback. Always focuses on the negative aspect of your work and doesn't understand that you have other responsibilities. Even if the sponsor was happy with our product, He would always find something to bash on us about (in a polite way). I give him that, He is just really disconnected from students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	1	Computer Science	444	2	2	4	4	1044256	8/20/09	A good lecturer, he often makes students think a little outside the box. He was engaging and managed to keep me awake during the classes. During team sessions he provided good insight into how to do better on the projects. The only slight hitch would be his grading. It is a little buzzword bingo, but if you know the material its not a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science	456	1	1	2	4	1044256	10/27/08	Worst teaching experience at RIT. Overwhelms you with 100+ pages of required readings weekly, and tests are based off of that. Very very inconsistent with grading and incredibly harsh. Will circle buzzwords on an exam and you get points based off of that. I have learned almost nothing in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Martinez	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	3	4	1044256	8/20/08	Worst experience at RIT. Refuses to give partial credit. Looks for "buzz words" on your answers when grading exams. Got a C in what should have been an easy A class...avoid at all costs!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Yukiko Maru	4.8	2	Japanese		3	5	5	5	1476787	2/25/13	Maru-Sensei is an excellent Japanese professor if you're enthusiastic about the language. I say this as she has high expectations for her students, but she is very fair in her grading. Quizzes are great in number and you will speak the language in front of the class in some way almost every day. That said, you will learn a great deal very quickly!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yukiko Maru	4.8	2	Japanese		2	4	5	4	1476787	4/4/11	Great professor. Very nice, learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yukiko Maru	4.8	2	Japanese	101	2	5	5	5	1476787	9/26/11	Maru-sensei is a very good teacher but understand that she is one tough cookie. She expects most of the students to study a lot. I do not recommend you to participate with course until you are 100% adjusted with school. She is very interactive when teaching and with just a small amount of studying everyday you will at least be a novice-ADV speaker.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	2	813009	4/9/13	she is the worst experience ever. very strict exams too long it does not teach well just reading all the time, lots of work to do, not helpful and she doesn't answer emails. stay away
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	4	813009	2/20/13	Very awkward teaching style. Grades were received very late, some even after the final exam. Knows the material, but does not know how to communicate it to students. The 2 classes I have taken with her are the only 2 that I have ever fallen asleep in in 3 years at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	2	Information Technology	351	4	5	5	3	813009	4/19/11	Mason was a great teacher! She drew very well thought out diagrams on the board to help out the students. Was always present and helpful in labs. Would highly recommend taking Networking Fundamentals with her :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	0	Information Technology		3	1	2	3	813009	11/30/10	Terrible Professor. Hands down the second worst I have ever had. She took 10 minute topics and stayed on them for 50 minutes. Terrible waste of my time and money.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	2	Information Technology	220	4	4	4	4	813009	11/11/06	The class was mostly review, but probably because it's the first year. Most of the time she was good, but sometimes she went way off topic and forgot where she was. Assigned a 6-8 page term paper for a mostly worthless class. Kept telling the smartest kid in the class that he wasn't allowed to talk anymore!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	2	Information Technology		2	5	5	5	813009	2/21/06	One of the brightest and most engaging professors I had in undergraduate and gradaute work. Tough but fair. You will work a lot and learn a lot. Too bad she got married.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	1	813009	3/25/13	Impossible to stay awake, monotone and reads off slides or writes messy long diagrams on the board. Little patience or helpfulness. I knew networking before I took the class and she would always try and trip me up when all I did was come to class and do the work. Woman has no life. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	0	Information Technology	351	3	2	2	5	813009	11/9/11	Graded poorly (taking off points for questions that weren't asked). Doesn't know much about the field. Will interrupt you when you try to ask questions. Won't answer questions before an exam(during lecture period when the exam is right after). Poorly organized. Will never take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	2	Information Technology	351	3	5	4	4	813009	3/23/11	Great teacher. She really knows what she's talking about and it shows. If you have any questions, she answers them in detail and actually asks if you understand after. She was a great source of knowledge and help in labs too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Mason	2.8	2	Information Technology	545	3	4	4	5	813009	3/2/07	Nice & easy going manner of teaching. More concerned about students understanding the subject, rather than rushing thro. She is extremely knowledgeable, and it shows. Shows much personal alacrity for the subject. She will be vague at times for a good reason that force you to explore the topic yourself in the lab.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Manu Mathai	2.0	0	Science Technology & Society	101	2	2	2	1	1581166	5/16/11	Asked way too much of his students for a L.A. class. Each missed class is 5% off your final grade. Each HW was to read 1-2 published journals and be prepared to talk about them. Not to mention the 8 page group paper, 4 page final paper, plus 2 other papers, AND midterm essay. He also has an accent, but it was generally understandable. BE CAUTIOUS!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	410279	5/19/12	Dr. Mathew please don't write comment about your self. what you said above is the same of what you said in class before the evaluation. your really bad teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	2	Engineering	514	2	4	3	5	410279	8/11/10	A very good professor; Dr. Mathew expects you to learn. When he asks a question in class he expects you to know enough to answer him, and expects people to actually answer. Test Q's are not always phrased the same as homework, but are doable if you understand the material. Helpful in office hours and class lectures are worth attending.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	0	Engineering	554	2	2	2	3	410279	5/20/09	Prof can be hard to understand, grading isn't always consistent
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	0	Engineering	381	3	2	1	2	410279	9/8/11	TERRIBLE TEACHER, sounds like a combination of Yoda and Kermit the Frog, with a horrible accent. Does not speak clearly, and confuses students on simple topics such as V=IR. Confused energy and power on the first day. AVOID
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	0	Engineering	320	1	1	1	4	410279	8/5/09	Cosine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Athimoottil Mathew	2.3	2	Engineering		2	5	5	NULL	410279	5/17/04	The best RIT professor - you will learn two courses worth in one. Don't take him if you don't want to learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura  Mauldin	4.0	2	Science Technology & Society		5	3	5	3	1765562	11/16/12	Class was all discussion based. 4 pop quizzes based on readings. 1 reading assignment and paragraphs response per week for homework. Paper for midterm and final very clearly laid out what she wants. Everyone got an A on them no problem. Interesting discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Maxwell	1.5	0	Film		4	1	2	1	1344296	5/8/11	I would not advise taking Maxwell's section of production unless you are interested in experimentalist animation. She is not very accommodating if she doesn't like you idea, and can sometimes be condescending. She's not someone I'd recommend as an advisor, either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	2	Music		5	5	5	5	769669	11/11/10	Very good prof. Is in Germany for a while now. One of my favorite classes. Easy tests. Learned a lot. Very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	2	Music	214	4	5	5	4	769669	3/23/10	Prof seems fidgety at first, but great teacher, great course. Never read the text, got a solid B. A fairly easy liberal arts credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	2	Music	150	3	5	4	2	769669	5/30/07	Take his music appreciation class. He lectures a lot but he writes everything you need to know for tests on the board and is very clear on what your assignments are. Gives extra credit if you need to make something up and always willing to help. As long as you read the material and study a bit, you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	1	Music		5	2	3	4	769669	8/17/10	He was alright. Took all of his information straight from the text. Lecture was incredibly dry and boring. If you have any music background do not take this you will be bored out of your mind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	2	Music		5	4	4	4	769669	2/6/09	Love this man! Tests were so easy and he was a lot of fun. If you play an instrument for the class, he'll give you 10 extra points on a test. Take his Fine Arts Music course for sure!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Maynor	4.2	2	Music		5	4	4	4	769669	12/2/05	MARK MAYNOR IS THE MAN ! Lol actually hes really figity and creepy (adult adhd ?). He seems crazy but hes actually a cool guy. If you pay attention in class you dont need to study for the tests. If you take the class though make sure you have some appreciation for "fine arts" msuci. Not contemporary. Or at least have an open mind.youllenjoyitmore
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		3	5	5	3	907873	3/25/10	Best prof I've had. She is clear and so sharp herself, and really cares about your writing. Don't take this class tho if you want an easy grade or to slack off. She's tough and it's worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	907873	1/5/10	I dont think she works here anymore. Too bad, shes great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	907873	12/11/09	She asks alot of students, but she is fair. funny!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	1	Writing		3	3	3	3	907873	7/22/09	Wasn't The best teacher...Worst readings ever, Actually made writing extremely difficult :( . . . wasn't my best experience. avoid this woman if you can.. she was kind of funny, thats the best thing i can say
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	0	Writing		2	2	2	3	907873	5/14/09	Save yourself the time and do not take any course she has to offer...grades very strict on grounds not made clear. She uses the driest reading text as a bases of the class. Definitely one of my least favorite classes ever....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	0	Writing	101	2	1	1	4	907873	4/12/09	See is an OK teacher. If you can take the class with another teacher, you are saving your self time and effort. Was not a complete wast of time but hardly learned anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		4	5	5	2	907873	10/23/08	Very fun teacher. The Arts of Expression subject was Writing the Discipline and about Scientific Biography. Books were mediocre, but somehow Professor Mazzolini was able to make the class enjoyable and interesting. I would highly suggest taking any classes she's teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		3	5	5	3	907873	10/7/08	Material was always well presented and understandable. Student oppinions seemed valued, discussion added to course and was well directed, assignments never felt contrived, great books (both of them), proffessor was very understanding and acocmodating. peer reviews felt valuable and not like a waste of time as they often to in other courses.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		4	4	4	2	907873	12/5/06	Learned a lot about writing while still an overall easy class. When responding to readings in her class and you'd always get a response of "Totally!" or "Right On!" You will hear these words often. The essays were kind of squished into the last half of the quarter which was kind of hectic, but she's also new to RIT and its quarter system.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	0	Writing	252	4	1	1	4	907873	1/5/10	Very mean to students. Doesn't seem to know what she's doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	1	Writing		4	2	3	3	907873	12/19/09	I didn't find the material interesting and I don't feel as though I took anything away from the class, nor did agree with her distribution of course work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	907873	8/12/09	Mazzolini's great. teh assignments are hard and complex, but shes very helpful. do the reading follow directions and ask questions and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	1	Writing	101	2	3	3	2	907873	5/18/09	I took Writing Seminar. The professor had ridiculous policies in regards to grading. It seemed almost impossible to receive decent grades on simple assignments. She was funny though. I would not take a class with this professor again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		2	4	4	2	907873	4/24/09	Readings were hard, but the teacher was very good. Its nto an easy class, but I learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		2	3	4	3	907873	11/25/08	The class was boring to go to, but the teacher was very helpful and good to work with. Your really graded off the the three essays that you turn into her so just make sure you do those to the best of your ability.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		2	5	5	5	907873	10/11/08	instructor knew everyone's name the first week; was always on time; was always cheerful and open to answering questions; never looked down upon anyone or considered a question inappropriate; is very knowledgable about many subjects in science.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		2	5	5	4	907873	6/1/08	Best prof imaginable. Funny, super-smart, doesn't take any bs, and totally helpful and clear. She took hours to read and comment on my work, revise w/me. She is a serious scholar too, so that meant a lot to me.I learned so much from her! A+++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	0	Writing	502	2	2	2	3	907873	2/2/07	Good professor but gets totally off track very EASILY...class sessions are really short...asks to do a lot of reading and requires to write 5-6 papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Mazzolini	3.6	2	Writing		2	5	5	2	907873	10/31/06	great teacher. very good at writing and at teaching. and she almost always will let out class early. (class usually doesn't last more than half an hour.) however, there is a constant workload, and most of the assignments will tie into each other by the end of the semester; so get lazy.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig McArt	3.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	68958	8/31/05	Craig offered clear technique instead of just abstractly talking around a design problem. There are very few teachers like that, but alas, he is gone.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia McCluskey	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	446	5	5	5	3	1435039	5/24/11	Took her for "Women and crime". Very nice professor. Lectures can be a little boring at times but midterm and final are online and open-note and the power points are put up on MyCourses. Listens to students' opinions, too and willing to help if you need it. Definitely recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia McCluskey	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	4	2	1435039	4/21/10	This is an easy A if you attend class and do the required work. She puts all notes on mycourses, so you dont have to take notes in class. She gives you an exam review sheet that covers everything that will be on the test. Just a VERY boring class to take. Everything is straight out of the book, so its a snooze fest.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loretha  McCullough	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	4	5	5	3	1754149	10/15/12	Loretha is great! She is strict but her expectations are easy and there is no reason why you shouldn't get an A+
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rachel  McGinnis	1.0	0	Political Science		1	1	1	1	1806735	4/5/13	She is the first teacher that made me want to withdraw from a class that I was halfway through in my final semester. She is extremely picky about every assignment and her guidelines are outrageous! She makes the class much less enjoyable and gives a lot more work that is irrelevant and useless. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Molly McGowan	4.5	2	Social Science		5	4	5	3	1451284	5/17/11	Very idealistic and believes in the horribly written book she uses for the class. Naive, often did not address high level questions, wholesome, and gave a large amount of busywork. She could possibly be better, but the Leading Others class is trite and painful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Molly McGowan	4.5	2	Social Science		5	5	5	5	1451284	6/1/10	Experiential leadership was a great class, and I learned alot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Molly McGowan	4.5	2	Social Science		4	4	4	3	1451284	10/20/10	She is a cool professor, but her monotone voice will lull you to sleep. Other than she knows alot. I took her Leading others class and i learned some good stuff
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	0	Freshman Year Experience		1	1	1	1	819983	2/6/08	Well I'm not entirely sure what to say. He preaches this class like a Missionary Preaches religion. You're welcome to disagree with his views if you don't mind being kicked out of class for a day...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	0	Freshman Year Experience		1	1	1	1	819983	11/3/07	He is very religious & easily offended in regards to his Christian faith; refuses to treat or speak to students as equals; takes FYE way too seriously & personally; will count you absent if you're more than 5 minutes late to class; assigns time-wasting assignments that are complete bs essays that other FYE classes do not do; AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	0	Freshman Year Experience		4	1	2	1	819983	1/25/07	This class was a combination of Physics, Calc, and Stupidity on steroids. This professor did not teach us a single thing. Instead he told us what we had to do, made us buy the materials, and then build it without any help whatsoever from him. Any of the thoughts of him being a good teacher soon depleted a few minutes after I met him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	1	Freshman Year Experience		3	1	4	1	819983	12/3/07	boring class, boring teacher, pointless activities like those you did in summer camp in like 3rd grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	0	Freshman Year Experience	502	1	1	1	2	819983	1/29/07	I don't even know where to start. DO NOT TAKE FYE FROM BRIAN MATTHEWS. That about sums it up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Matthews	1.6	1	Freshman Year Experience		5	1	4	1	819983	3/13/06	I actually wish I was an NTID student for this class. It was a burden on my life to show up to this joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Maurer	4.8	2	Information Technology	882	2	5	5	2	1535985	11/9/11	He does a very good job with material that is very dull.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Maurer	4.8	2	Information Technology	882	4	5	4	3	1535985	1/28/11	Current CISO of RIT. Very helpful and reasonable about delaying assignments due to confusion. You will read a lot in this class but you will learn a lot from it at the same time. Weekly papers can be a bit long but important at enforcing the course topics. Exams are a bit on the tough side but class is curved. I would recommend to others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian May Follow Shanthosa	4.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1616848	1/27/13	Brian is the best. Very relax, super chill. Likes to help. So long as you put your effort in, you will get the A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian May Follow Shanthosa	4.8	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	4	1616848	8/11/12	Best professor I've had at RIT. I was already interested in 3D modeling to begin with, but he made it so much better. This is one of the few classes that I really wanted to attend (Even the extra ones that he provided for extra credit I didn't need). I ended up with a 100 in the class and had a great time. He's very nice and extremely helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian May Follow Shanthosa	4.8	2	Information Technology	346	4	4	5	2	1616848	11/15/11	Nice guy. If you're bad at art, this class might be tough, but he gives good suggestions and is extremely relaxed. Just do your art and you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian May Follow Shanthosa	4.8	2	Information Technology	346	5	5	4	1	1616848	11/1/12	Brian was an awesome teacher for 2D animation. I can't draw or do any of that stuff, but it doesn't matter to him. As long as you get the fundamental concepts down with a reasonable effort, he'll help you out. Lots of out of class work due to the nature of the course though but again, put in the effort and you'll get an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian May Follow Shanthosa	4.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	2	1616848	5/8/12	One of the greatest professors I've had. Gave me an actual reason to go to class and learn something that I didn't think I would care about. We had to learn Maya in the class, and it was one of the most confusing things I've ever worked with, but he explained everything and wouldn't stop until you understood it. Take this professor if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	205710	2/23/06	Best teacher I've ever had. Treats students as equals, and promotes discussion and student-lead classes. Highly reccommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		3	5	5	2	205710	5/20/05	great professor, words can't describe how good he is at teaching compared to most. doesn't ever feel the need to intimidate or hold grades above your head. he is always open to communicating with his students in a positive way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		4	5	5	4	205710	3/3/05	A great professor. Has some health problems-this sometimes affects his ability to attend class- but the amount of energy and enthusiasm he shows otherwise totally makes up for it. Class is interesting and kept me awake. Quizzes were fair, group projects were fun. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		3	5	5	NULL	205710	5/6/03	Seriously one of my favorite profeccors. He knows his stuff and it shows. He makes class interesting, and fun to be in, even early in the morning. He tends to add last minute notes to test reviews though, but it great with keeping up with mycourse!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		4	5	5	5	205710	10/8/05	He is one of the best teachers i have had at RIT. If you can take him do it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		2	5	5	5	205710	3/8/05	He is, by far, my favorite professor at this institute. Adjectives cannot even begin to describe him -- he's tough but fair, and there's lots of active learning. Quizzes were open-note, and depending on the class (and how involved everyone is), he makes the final open-note or take-home. TAKE HIM!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Mazanec	5.0	2	Communication		4	5	5	NULL	205710	8/8/04	Very good. Tests are hard but I looked forward to his class every day. Loves to argue and hear students opinions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	1	Physics		2	3	3	2	746598	7/15/12	I thought he was a great teacher, but not easy. If you are interested in understanding material take him because he truly understand the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	1	Physics		4	3	3	2	746598	2/1/10	At first I had a hard time understanding his accent, but got through that quickly. His class is kind of boring, make sure you pay attention. And beware webassign, thankfully it is only a small portion of your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		2	1	1	3	746598	1/22/09	Worst professor on the face of the planet. Avoid him at all costs. Reading off of a pdf file doesn't make you a legit professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	2	Physics		3	4	4	3	746598	10/1/08	Gets you to think about the material. If you want easy class, then this is not for you, but if you want to actually learn then this is the prof to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	746598	4/30/06	not helpfull, will not help you even if you ask him to
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		2	1	1	3	746598	1/24/06	Worst teacher i have ever had. Does not explain anything and when you ask him a question, skirts around the question. Very tough to understand too.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	1	Physics		2	3	3	2	746598	7/15/12	I thought he was a great teacher, but not easy. If you are interested in understanding material take him because he truly understand his things
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics	313	1	2	2	3	746598	2/19/09	Is extremely tough. Classes are poorly executed. May know his material, but is poor at explaining it. Labs are disorganized. You'll have to learn from the book, if that even helps. Tests are difficult most of the time. Avoid if possible, could ruin your GPA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		1	2	2	4	746598	11/14/08	Avoid. Lectures are in a state of incoherent disarray with no obvious effort exerted to organize the material in a digestible manner. Exams are painful and graded borderline unreasonably. Makes many mistakes in class and while grading exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	2	Physics	312	2	5	5	4	746598	5/21/08	Teacher knows what he is talking about. Being so used to just cramming for tests just to get by, this is the first teacher to make me think about what I was doing. Highly recommend if you are interested in the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		2	1	1	2	746598	3/13/06	Horrible teacher, Very hard to understand his native african tongue. Never answers your questions, and if you question something in anyway, he will take offense to it and finds a way to insult you in the process. Tests are farely hard, but labs and assigned work are very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manasse Mbonye	2.3	0	Physics		2	2	2	4	746598	11/17/05	I usually don't like my teacher, but I taught myself from the book the entire quarter even though I attending all of his classes. Just does not explain topics in a clear method. There was one behavioral issue in class that he handeled very poorly. Get another prof if you can and a better text book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts	214	3	4	4	4	965557	3/7/13	Fun class. Enjoyed taking this course as I listened to good music and learned a lot. There are 6 tests based on lecture material. You are allowed to use the lecture notes during the tests, so make sure to take good notes and listen to the required music pieces on youtube channel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	965557	12/10/12	Easy A if you do the work. 3 concert reports and 1 term paper. Tests have a lot of bonus points! Very clear on what you need to know for the test and you can use your notes
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts	214	5	5	4	3	965557	10/29/12	This class is an extremely simple class. Show up, take notes and you will receive an A. He gives tests that have 40 extra bonus points possible. If you are willing to do one hour of homework twice a week, this is the class for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	4	965557	10/24/07	With suttin like classical music,he does his best 2 make the class less boring.seems 2 kno his subject wel.makes u listen 2 a hell lota music in each class-some may like it!Grading:3 concert reports must,6 xams,or best of 5 plus final.students with prior music bckgrnd seem 2 scorn him 4 sum reason.moderatly unhlepful,bt no other severe drawbacks

Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts	101	5	5	5	4	965557	2/11/13	Just show up to class, and take notes and you will be fine. 6 open note tests with plenty of bonus. Must attend 2 out of class classical music concerts, but no text book. Enjoyed the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts	214	5	5	5	2	965557	10/29/12	Makes learning music fun and makes learning it extremely easy. Puts tons of bonus points on the tests because he wants you to pass. You do have to go to 3 out of class concerts so keep that in mind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	5	965557	11/18/08	Very great teacher, easy A in the course if you show up. The main hw is listining to about 5 pieces a week and you're tested partially on those (just be able to identify them). All tests are open notes. Anyways, he's really cool and also has up to +30 in bonus points for tests, but you can't get over 100...
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	3	965557	10/19/07	incredibly unhelpful, attended every class and haven't learned a thing. terrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David McCarthy	3.8	0	Fine Arts	101	3	1	1	4	965557	3/14/07	He shoves his opinions down your throat, and just randomly says thing that makes you do a double take and has you thinking about the stupid comment for the rest of the class. He also contradicts himself severely. He is also a bad grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John  McCluskey	4.0	2	Criminal Justice	501	4	4	4	4	1795810	1/31/13	McCluskey is great! Discussion based classes, basically can discuss anything that interests us. Will cancel assignments if he feels there is too much. Great guy, super nice. Kinda cute in a nerdy way. Class discussion can get boring but overall great class! Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen McCoy	4.0	2	Humanities		4	5	4	4	1691050	2/14/13	Great professor. Provides interesting readings. Quizzes and midterms are easy but the class is interesting and offers thought provoking discussions. I missed my final and she gave me an extra credit assignment to get my grade from a C to a B, and saved my GPA. Great professor, HIGHLY recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen McCoy	4.0	2	Humanities	211	5	3	4	2	1691050	10/30/12	Really funny lady. The material is a bit dry. You have to try to not do well in that class. If you don't feel like doing the readings just use SparkNotes. Everyone did poorly on the midterm and she said she wouldn't let us get below a B so she eliminated a a bunch of questions that we all got wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen McCoy	4.0	2	Humanities		5	4	5	3	1691050	1/29/13	Had Colleen for Science Tech Values. Great lady, really funny. Rarely kept us for the whole 2 hour block. Interesting discussions derived from potentially dry material. Highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen McCoy	4.0	2	Humanities	211	5	3	4	2	1691050	5/17/12	A lot of readings, most of which are at least fairly interesting. If you do them, the final/midterm are really easy, and the two papers are mostly opinion based and appear to be graded as just you did it: 100
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica McDonald	4.0	2	Writing	227	4	4	4	3	1100700	2/4/08	She is very nice and is very approachable. The best part of having her for Writing Seminar is that we can revise our essays for a higher grade. Quizzes on the readings are sometimes hard, depending on the chapter. She is overall a better teacher than the norm.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aaron McGowan	2.9	1	Physics		1	3	3	4	1647203	2/22/13	Professor McGowan is a very smart guy and a good teacher overall so long as you pay attention in class and keep up with his work. Definitely don't go in expecting an easy grade. If your expectations are a little more level and you're looking to actually learn however, I would highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aaron McGowan	2.9	1	Physics	312	1	3	2	4	1647203	5/18/12	This guy knows his stuff. He is a brilliant guy who will push you hard. Physics is his life. As long as you think in precise math terms too, you will understand him, otherwise get your internal math to english translator going or open your textbook. If you are prone to sleeping, you will because of his monotone. Hard class, brilliant guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aaron McGowan	2.9	2	Physics		3	5	4	3	1647203	11/16/11	He is a new teacher but he is very helpful and the tests relates to what he teaches and assigns for mastering physics. highly recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aaron McGowan	2.9	1	Physics	312	1	3	2	3	1647203	5/27/12	Very friendly professor. He is absolutely passionate about what he does but is very difficult. If you want to really learn the material in depth and be challenged, I highly recommend him. If getting an easy A or B is what you want then I do not. Never get behind in his class, do the homework, and red the book and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Aaron McGowan	2.9	0	Physics		2	2	2	3	1647203	4/30/12	He tends to get the material across in lecture but he has a very dull speaking voice and puts little to no emphasis in presentation. Usually available for help after class hours, but you might be better off getting study help from Bates. You almost never get work out of the textbook and do nearly everything in the 'recommended' workbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas McLaine	4.0	2	Business	363	5	3	5	3	1101829	2/8/08	This class is every easy. You take tests and quizzes that you grade yourself. LOL. There is a big final project but he every helpful if you have problem getting information. You DON'T NEED the TEXTBOOK.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin McMahon	5.0	2	Information Technology	515	4	5	5	3	922430	11/20/06	Ben is awesome. Absolute minimum BS and maximum fun/learning. Great at leading students to an answer. Definitely one of the best adjuncts teaching at RIT - take him if you get the chance, usually night classes only. Has a very easygoing, matter of fact style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Forest McMullin	5.0	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	977889	4/16/07	Forest was an excellent professor, really knew his stuff and brought a lot of real world knowledge and experience to the classroom. Critiques were fun and insightful. The working photographers are always the best teachers, Forest is a good example of this. Sadly Forest was adjunct and only taught for two quarters, I hope he comes back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	216240	5/2/06	Very good teacher, knows what he is talking about. Has some interesting and funny stories. His class is actually one I enjoy going to. A good amount of reading needs to be done, but its all fairly interesting. He gives open note tests. Get a different teacher if u are easily offended, but if u can take a joke youll really enjoy him as a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	3	216240	12/2/04	exams are hard (NEED TO READ EACH QUESTIONS FIVE TIMES). Very tricky. A lot of reading. I did get an A but it took way lot of effort. He knows what he is talking about though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		1	5	4	NULL	216240	5/13/04	I learned quite a bit. Tons of extra reading not covered on tests which were pretty difficult. He is very full of himself but it is understandable considering his background in policing. My biggest complaint is that i was late to my next class every time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	NULL	216240	2/2/04	If anyone trash talks Dr. McQuade it's probably because they are a horrible student. He demands only the best work, you will fail miserably if you are lazy. This man is THE source for computer crime studies in the USA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	4	NULL	216240	11/22/03	And you spelled his name wrong! it's McQuaid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	0	Criminal Justice		1	1	1	NULL	216240	5/26/03	Teacher is an Egomaniac who babbles endlessly about pointless things, doesnt cover proper material, gives extremely complicated tests and refuses feedback from students. On a last note, you will never get out of this class on time since he loves to talk.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	216240	2/22/05	Excellent professor. He knows what he is talking about. I must say that you should't take the course if you don't want to work hard but after all the work you have learned a lot. Great teacher! I wish I could have him in other classes. Unique teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	0	Criminal Justice		2	2	1	4	216240	10/18/04	To start, I did get an 'A' in the class. I would recommend avoiding this prof at least for this class. No real knowledge of comp crime. His tests are unfair and have nothing to do with how much of the material you know. You'll either like him or not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	0	Criminal Justice		1	2	2	NULL	216240	2/18/04	He was teaching for the first time at RIT so he sure made everything VERY complicated. Should teach the graduate courses!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	1	Criminal Justice		3	3	3	NULL	216240	12/3/03	The name's actually McQuade, moron.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	NULL	216240	11/21/03	Oh wait, he's actually really good and knows what he's talking about. Afraid of actual academic work? Scared to read and do some research?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samuel McQuade	3.5	0	Criminal Justice		1	1	1	NULL	216240	5/26/03	So boring and pointless
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	1	Graphic Arts		3	3	3	5	111701	9/3/12	Bruce is a Typography expert without a doubt, if you want to master type take his class. That being said, he is also really subjective in grading so if you disagree with anything he believes he will grade you poorly. I never cared about grades so it didn't matter but he is really full of himself. I doubt he has much professional experience at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	3	4	111701	10/21/11	He does talk a little too much. He is excellent designer & knows his material & has a impressive contact base (for example he knows Vignelli and Bruno Monguzi personally). He has excellent advice & has helped me a lot with my work. However when he helps you he sometime will resolve the problem himself before you figure it out. overall, he is great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	3	4	111701	5/20/10	Has he had any real world experience? Doubt it. Would be nice if he could show up to class on time, just once. Very disrespectful. But clearly he does what he wants and RIT will continue to keep him around regardless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts	101	3	5	5	3	111701	5/14/07	He is a pretty good teacher and knows alot about graphic design, especially typography. There wasn't any required reading, but he gave some reading suggestions that were really helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	3	5	111701	9/24/05	He never gets to class on time, ever. He talks forever. The critiques take almost 3 hours. But he is passionate about the work and know alot about typography
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	4	5	111701	4/27/05	Good teacher however it took him 5 months to get my work back.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	5	4	111701	3/2/12	Great teacher, knows his material Typography like its his life. Can at times be boring and get caught up in his own lectures but if your willing to put effort on your projects and ask for his advice he will help you and you will learn alot about type. As well as knows Vignelli personally and will talk about his work a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	4	3	4	111701	1/27/11	Such an easy class and easy grade- He expects you to do your work, but it isn't hard as long as you pay attention. Only really mandatory attendance is in lab. A+ Professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	0	Graphic Arts	101	4	1	2	5	111701	1/28/08	The worst teacher at RIT. BY FAR!!! it's sad that students have to have such an awful teacher at such a "great" design school. the design department wouldn't be half bad if he wasn't in charge. his design style and teachings are still from 1980 and he has no clue what the present design world is like! DO NOT take classes with this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	0	Graphic Arts		4	2	2	5	111701	2/4/07	If you have to have him, don't schedule him for a morning class becuase you will fall asleep. I wish I had taken a different teacher because he doesn't really let you be creative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		5	3	4	1	111701	9/2/05	he was actually my advisor as well. this was one of my most boring classes, which tended to be a lot of the design curriculum.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Meader	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	5	111701	4/3/05	Brilliant Professor

Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics	201	4	5	4	4	67410	1/23/09	Meadows is the man. You just need to give him a chance. He is helpful, and fair. Pay attention in class, ask questions after, show him you want to work for your grade, and he will be one of the best math professors you will have. He has good teaching techniques. He gets better with every quarter you have him. Liberal on homework too. Just do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	5	67410	10/23/08	Not very good with teaching. He is extremely smart but skips a lot of steps when doing things on the board so it is easy to get lost. His tests are fair but doesn't give too much partial credit, even if you were on the right track. He pretty much expects you to get a 60% on all of his tests, but that doesn't mean you won't get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	3	67410	5/29/08	Meadows does get a bad reputatuion for the amount of hw and the difficulty of the tests. However, there is a "fudge factor" which he gives you points for going to class, completeing hw, going to review sessions and all around showing effort. This makes it possible to get an A in the class without having an A average. Very smart and good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics	281	3	4	3	4	67410	1/22/08	he isnt always that clear but will ALWAYS help you out and his tests are pretty easy cause he tells you EXACTLY what is on them and he is extremely approachable and even if you mess up the tests you can still pull off a B easily
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics	272	1	1	1	4	67410	10/22/07	This professor is crazy with his homework assignments!! Over 150 problems the first week I was in the class!! And he just mumbles on and on in his monotone, boring voice... I love math and have always been the best student in my classes with 100's on everything and I love math, but even I couldn't handle the insane amount of work he required.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	2	67410	11/20/06	PB Calc 1. He is a very very very hard profesor, the homework amount is insane we had over 150 problems once in a week!. He makes the workshops really hard however you will learn a lot, since he covers more then all the other teachers. If you love math to death you'll like him. Very good teacher, but really hard. Dont take him if you suck at math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	67410	10/20/05	Doesnt fully explain the notes he puts on the board, but keeps on talking about them in long proofs a million words per minute, which will put anyone to sleep. Workshop problems are horrible although they relate to the chapter being worked on; they do not help in the overall explanation of the unit. I should have dropped the class when I could. Switch to a different teacher immediately!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	67410	1/31/05	boring, dry, overall horrible teacher. if you need help he says to read the book which is equally as unhelpful or to go through your notes and redo all problems. takes off excessive points on tests for small mistakes. avoid him at all costs!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	67410	11/21/08	A very good professor overall. He assigns tons of work but does not expect you to complete it all. His lectures are very in depth, giving you more information than needed. His test are very hard, with the best students usually getting 80's. He adjusts this when he is giving out final grades, you will end up with a better grade than you think.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics	999	1	5	5	5	67410	7/23/08	Very smart, and very challenging. If you're good at math, you'll probably want him as a professor. Although the top students in the class will get around 70% on the tests, he does not draw the line for an A at 90%. In fact, your grade will likely be much higher than you expect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	3	3	67410	4/1/08	Dougie Fresh (long story), gets a bad rap because of the amount of homework he gives, and how he grades tests. As soon as you make it through an entire quarter though, you learn what he actually expects. He doesn't expect you to finish all the homework, he gives extremely hard tests and expects people to average 60-70%. He's almost like a real coll
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics	282	1	2	2	2	67410	11/6/07	Great guy, very smart, but really can't teach well. To make up for it, he gives large amounts of homework. He's almost too smart: he skips steps and if you're not paying attention you'll miss everything. He's also very disorganized, and regularly neglects to tell us when homework is due while misleading us on what to expect in an upcoming exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	1	67410	3/19/07	Prof. Meadows is the man. This guy is a champion: duke of derivatives, colonel of calculus, master of math. However, he's often way above your head and his explanations are very long winded.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	1	67410	10/21/05	Can't learn anything from his class. Alot definations on the test, weight more than you can dream. Hard grading. avoid if possible! Warning!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67410	1/31/05	i dropped the class after 1 day. i made the right choice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Meadows	2.6	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	NULL	67410	6/18/03	So Boring...zzzzz..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Medlar	4.9	2	Engineering		4	5	5	1	1540283	3/5/12	Lab instructor for thermofluids lab. Really knows his stuff, and imparts his wisdom onto you if you'll listen to what he's telling & asking you. Will sit with you in an empty lab for as long as it takes to be sure you understand whatever you're having trouble with. Excellent professor, highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Medlar	4.9	2	Engineering		4	5	5	1	1540283	5/10/11	He tells you what he wants to see & grades you accordingly. Parthum doesn't tell you what he wants until everybody gets 70 or less on the lab, and then is mystified why nobody read his mind & noted the obscure methodology he wanted to see. Medlar's a great lab instructor, get him if you can because he'll do whatever he can to help you get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Medlar	4.9	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	1540283	10/26/11	Medlar is a bro. Take him he is helpful and cares that you learn. He will give you a hard time about it, but he is just kidding with you. Took him for solid modeling and Statics Lab.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mike Medlar	4.9	2	Engineering	262	5	5	4	5	1540283	2/11/11	He is wicked cool. Very helpful when you get stuck on a SolidWorks project, however at some times, he wouldn't be able to solve the problem. He is very flexible and would let you to pass the problem. His lectures may be dry and would sometimes make a joke in middle of it. Take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Meneely	4.0	2	Engineering	361	4	5	3	1	1696819	2/27/12	Really helpful guy. Sometimes his explanations were a bit lacking (he stutters a bit when he talks, which was sometimes confusing). Always willing to help if you need it. Also is very helpful in intervening in groups with lazy members. He is very fair and easy to talk to. Clearly defines what his expectations are for each assignment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		4	5	5	5	608414	10/20/09	Amazing teacher. Had him for intro to IR and thats why I chose it as my minor. He makes you learn and work, but it's really easy to get an A if you at least try to do it. He is really interesting and makes his classes too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies	513	5	4	5	4	608414	2/5/08	Great teacher and funny but I always fall asleep in his class. you really need the book because the homework base on the book reading and it 50% of your grade. It a good class to get an A and talk about current and past historical event. The class really don't teach you much but it a place to express your ideas.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		5	3	5	4	608414	2/23/07	Spencer Meredith is the Man. He is one of the best professors at RIT. He is very funny and will keep you entertained. Also showed us Conan during class which was awesome. He is a genuinely nice guy and is very approachable. Looked forward going to his class everyday. Great!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies	205	4	4	5	4	608414	11/11/06	Great professor! Always kept things interesting, and put some fun into every thing. Really a great guy. Sometimes the reading can be a bit tough, and confusing, but the summaries aren't too difficult. And the summaries and presentation are the only homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		2	5	5	5	608414	10/29/06	Easily the best professor I've ever had. Has a good time during class and still manages to put out an excellent, comprehensive lesson. Just don't slack off! The work is tough, and if you don't do it, you'll get burned for it. If you don't get anything out of his classes, then chances are YOU'RE the problem, not him. He's always available for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		5	5	5	1	608414	2/3/06	I had him for Senior Seminar during the summer, and that was an awesome class. Most laid back teacher, made the class be fun...I mean, come on, everybody knows senior seminar is supposed to be dull and boring, but the discussions and presentation was well worth it. I think he's an awesome teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	1	International Studies		4	1	4	5	608414	10/18/05	This guy thinks he's the greatest professor ever and if he didn't he might be a better professor. He's not hard, but he slips his own opinion in too much (often nonsensical) and has a hard time keeping on topic. Avoid him if you want to really learn IR since he just has you read the entire 400 page book, doesn't teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		3	5	5	5	608414	4/29/05	Prof. Meredith is an excellent professor. The classes are a lot of work but they are actually enjoyable to go to. The class I was in had no tests or quizzes but you were expected to read and write papers. He is not a boring lecturing but rather wants class discussions. I would take the class agai
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	1	International Studies		2	3	2	1	608414	3/10/08	Meredith was rather interesting. I did not learn a single thing in his class and yet worked so much. Summaries are tedious and unessesary, and you better do a through job if you expect to get full credit.(he is really picky on this) There were no tests other than a midterm and final. DO NOT take this class if you want to learn IR. Total waste!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		3	5	5	4	608414	3/3/07	OMG! Smart, nice, funny, he rocks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies	214	5	4	5	4	608414	11/20/06	Lot of work in class, but 50% of grade was showing up and turning in assigned work. Assignments were done on completion basis. Easy class. Dr. Meredith made the class extremely interesting, he always reltated examples to family guy. Take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		3	4	4	5	608414	10/31/06	Great professor, very engaging in class, likes to talk a lot, not always on subject. Lot of reading for summaries but you can really just skim and still get full credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		5	5	5	5	608414	5/17/06	He's a genious, I have never met such a good teacher in my life. He's one of the most interesting and fun teachers here at RIT. I hate history, but he deffinately made me more aware of it, and made me interested in it. Horray, Spencer, you are the man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies	250	2	5	5	1	608414	10/23/05	funny - got great teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Spencer Meredith	4.4	2	International Studies		5	5	5	5	608414	5/1/05	Best prof I've had at RIT. Class is very fun and interesting. Keeps everyone involved. Good jokes, loves Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, etc (even I2Hub). Doesn't believe much in tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		5	5	5	5	1104463	2/19/11	Great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		5	4	3	2	1104463	7/20/10	Total jerk in the classroom but one-on-one he is really nice and helpful. As long as you don't go against his opinion in front of people you'll be good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		4	5	5	4	1104463	1/25/10	I have never seen him be rude to anyone and am confused by these comments. He knows his stuff and explains very clearly and patiently. He is open to questions and gives fill in the blank notes that are easy to follow, and the material is applicable and he wants us to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		4	4	5	4	1104463	12/19/08	Dr Merrill is god-like. Everyone who thinks otherwise is a dunce. if your going to take a lab science, take it with him, goto class, memorize study guides for tests, and ur set....best prof ever
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		2	5	5	4	1104463	6/2/08	It's pretty simple to excel in his classes. Just do the work and participate. However, I have to say that he is very judgmental and it is near to impossible to get back on his good side if you've slipped.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	0	Medicine		1	1	1	1	1104463	7/30/10	Spent every class lamenting the failures of the educational system and tearing into students. Grading was completely subjective, blatant favoritism, would tear into you even if you were right and he had no clue what he was talking about, avoid if at all possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		2	5	5	5	1104463	7/9/10	Dr. Merrill prides himself on pushing his students, and does his best to ensure that you excel. His thoughts and comments are usually dead on. If you are willing to do the work, you will succeed and really understand the meaning "upper level science courses." If you want to be lazy don't take his classes. Dr. Merrill is the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	2	Medicine		4	3	4	2	1104463	3/9/09	For Human Bio, he was awesome. He likes to talk, but it's interesting and the tests are just copies of the quizzes/previous tests on mycourses. If you go to class and don't fall asleep, you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	0	Medicine		1	1	1	1	1104463	11/6/08	Absolutely, positively, the WORST excuse for a "teacher" on the face of the planet. Egotistical, non helpful, and NO ONE gives a damn about his one sided, constantly wrong opinions. I envy the deaf kids in class, as they can close their eyes, and away he goes! RIT should be ashamed to employ such an incompetent ego-driven teaching FAILURE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Douglas Merrill	3.5	0	Medicine		2	2	2	1	1104463	3/18/08	I have no idea how he grades the class. He had us do a few projects, which he tore apart, but never gave out grades. He was rude during class, and nobody's opinion was right except his.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan McKenzie	5.0	2	English		4	5	5	1	1214952	7/4/11	I went into the class completely uninterested in LOTR and came out knowing the entire universe and absolutely loving it. I am very sad to see excellent professors such as this leave RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stan McKenzie	5.0	2	English		1	5	5	4	1214952	11/24/08	McKenzie is the former provost who's teaching his old subject -- Shakespeare. An excellent class!! McKenzie can actually make sense of the stuff and his lectures are fascinating, but be forewarned, the class requires a lot of reading!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	104	4	5	5	4	1101297	12/12/12	Amy was nice, although I didn't really care for most of her projects. I did well in her class even though I'm into computer arts and not drawing. If you had a question on your work outside of class you could takture and send it to you and she would help. Overall a pretty easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	123	3	5	4	3	1101297	10/26/11	great teacher. super enthusiastic and knows what she is talking about. she expects a lot from you though. take her class if you want to GET BETTER at drawing, not just to get an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts		1	5	3	2	1101297	1/19/11	Great teacher! Really knows what she's doing but sometimes it's hard to understand the point she's trying to get across. Helped me get into drawing and improve amazingly. If you want an easy class don't take her: She's hard as hell, but she'll make you an amazing drawer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts		1	5	3	5	1101297	2/25/10	Amy is a wonderful professor, willing to help you whenever you need it, and she genuinely cares about your growth as a student and individual, unlike most of the foundations teachers here. She's really hard to understand sometimes, but is very challenging and pushes you out of your shell to be better. She's adorable and full of energy. Take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	1	1101297	12/15/08	Great teacher, I absolutely hated drawing, design etc. before this course, but she really tried hard to make it fun and relevant. She gives a lot of freedom with assignments, so that was great for a foundation class, because I could still work in whatever medium I wanted. She was absolutely nuts, but I would take her again if I could.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	1101297	2/28/08	Amazing teacher! I wouldnt replace her with anyone! She's tough but I've learned an incredible amount. She likes to customize projects to what students want to do, and tries to keep people motivated. She always has things to challenge people on, but gives enough compliments to boost confidence as well. Take her if you want to learn something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	123	4	5	5	4	1101297	5/17/12	An amazing teacher, probably the best I have ever had. Classes are casual and she always listens to student feedback. Be prepared to learn about "happy accidents" and bricks that "make you want to cry". The big project of each quarter is usually finished by week 9 to help ease the burden of finals week. Would absolutely take her class again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	212	2	5	5	4	1101297	6/2/11	I thank her for my improvement in drawing... and art in general. Great teacher. She is a TRUE artist! She pushes her students to get better.. and they sure do! Fun and friendly lady!! Even though I was frustrated throughout her class (lack of drawing skills), she made me want to come to class and do better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	2	5	1101297	6/30/10	Amy was my favorite teacher this year. She pushes you to your limits. Not clear on things- speaks in sounds rather than words. Take her, she's fun :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	4	1101297	12/1/09	She is sometimes hard to understand, and she can ask a lot of you, but if you push through and do the work, she definitely rewards you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	4	5	1101297	7/16/08	She took over for Cliff Wun when he went on sabbatical, and I have to tell you- she was tougher than him in a lot of respects. Getting an A from Amy is nearly impossible, but you will learn a LOT. She is wacky, crazy, and a ton of fun. You'll love her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy McLaren	4.2	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	2	1101297	2/6/08	Incredible teacher, I have learned a ton from her this in my drawing foundation classes. My class with her has improved much more than most other foundation classes. She works you long and hard, but she'll take into account what students want to do and will try to make things fun. Take classes with her if you want to learn something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne  McMillan	4.2	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	5	1	1793967	2/25/13	It's pathways so it's an easy class and Suzanne was nice and extremely approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne  McMillan	4.2	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	2	1793967	1/22/13	An easy A! She's a nice lady, tries to help as much as possible. Tries to make the class fun- maybe a little too excited! Just show up and do the work- not a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea McNeill	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	68975	5/5/08	Great teacher, very understanding. Just be sure to attend class consistently. Its not a very hard class, and is interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea McNeill	3.5	2	Fine Arts		5	3	5	3	68975	10/2/05	I noticed other students had trouble with this teacher. However, I aced the class. Since I care about others, I wonder if Andrea gave me good grades just because she's the advisor for my major??? I hope that's not the case. Her class is very easy as long as you study the handouts of vocab and notes. Beware though, she's hearing impaired, but she can hear more than you think she can ;-)

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea McNeill	3.5	2	Fine Arts		4	4	5	3	68975	2/20/06	I thought her class was fairly easy. Got an A. Enjoyed the materials throughly. I would take her class again if the chances arose.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea McNeill	3.5	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	NULL	68975	2/18/04	watch out... one mistake and she hates you

Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	601	4	5	4	5	9105	11/6/12	Took course to inform my volunteer work. Top 5 course in hundred+ McQ-W is entertaining as well as sharp. Speakers included judge, ex-con, prostitute advocate, etc. Toured jail. Projects were meaningful and up-to-date. You work hard on material you'd expect to see in a law office or courtroom. If you want to learn, sign up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	9105	8/23/09	I took 3 different classes with her. All very well taught and interesting. She's always willing to answer questions. In CrimLaw you are allowed to argue your answers and get points for the entire class so you can score way over 100% on tests you do very well on but other students do not. I miss her, but I feel she prepared me well for Law School.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	5	9105	1/17/09	She is one of the best liberal arts professor I have had in RIT. Very informal and willing to help. Very hard to fall asleep in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	4	9105	5/12/08	She is an amazing professor, probably the best in the criminal justice system. She is very knowledgeable and can answer most if not all questions thrown at her. She is possibly the most entertaining teacher as well, very informal, but gets you to learn the subject while enjoying yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	4	4	9105	2/7/08	She is a great professor for concepts in criminal law. HOWEVER, it's the kind of class where you constantly need to be on your toes because she WILL call on you randomly to go over court cases (as the other review said). Its not too bad though. She's funny and her tests are pretty easy. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	3	5	5	5	9105	9/12/07	She's an awesome teacher who really knows her stuff and makes it fun. She's probably one of the funniest people I've ever met and I feel really lucky to have had her as a teacher. I haven't had a class with her in a few years, and I still feel compelled to express my satisfaction with her teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	9105	12/1/05	LaVerne rocks. Her class was the most interesting class I've ever taken. She's hilarious, and even makes her tests funny. She's a very fair grader, but expects you to know your stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	NULL	9105	2/14/03	She's sassy, fiesty, friendly, funny, and very informative, but she's strict!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	3	5	5	4	9105	11/2/09	have taken 2 classes with her Concepts in Criminal Law and Prostitution and Vice. Both were amazing classes, she's really fun and helpful! Definitely take a class with her if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	4	5	5	5	9105	1/22/09	Thank you for eveything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	444	2	4	3	2	9105	11/6/08	This professor is a good one. She actually cares if you learn or not and it's something that people should experience at least once. The amazing thing is, there are so many students that take more than one class with her because they enjoy her classes so much. Definitely recommended but you must be able to read your textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	5	9105	5/11/08	1.Great guest speakers. 2.She's best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	9105	2/7/08	First off, you better read and know your court cases. However, Laverne is awesome, she's fun and gets you to easily understand NY statutes. The class is very interesting, you study odd court cases that she jokes around with. Medium difficulty tests, but she prepares you very well and you'll greatly enjoy her class and her personality!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	4	4	4	9105	4/27/06	Fun class, Easy work, Interesting class discussions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	NULL	9105	5/27/04	Great prof.. very insightful...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laverne McQuiller-Williams	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	NULL	9105	5/27/01	Great proffesor.Extremely helpful. You will work your butt off though!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorris Meadows	2.8	2	History	301	4	4	5	3	517724	12/21/05	Very clear with her information, a bit on the boring side. Was an easy class with decently easy to medium hard tests. Watched videos almost every class for 1/4 to 1/2 the class. Not all that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorris Meadows	2.8	0	History	301	5	1	1	3	517724	12/1/04	I toook American History with her and she is a bore i could not get interested even a little. Bad Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorris Meadows	2.8	1	History		5	2	4	4	517724	4/6/05	She is as easy of a teacher as you will find. VERY libral, she tries to be nice to other opinons but quite often she can be view as an extremist. You can learn stuff if you just listen, she does have a good knowledge of history.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bonnie Meath-Lang	4.9	2	Theater		3	5	5	5	352227	9/18/10	Bonnie is someone who is very passionate about theatre. She is one of the best teachers I have ever had in NTID, take her performing arts courses, they're a lot of fun! Take her and audition for her plays!!!! A+++++++++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bonnie Meath-Lang	4.9	2	Theater		5	5	5	5	352227	12/8/09	She's one of the best Performing Arts teachers I have ever had. She's extremely helpful and the final papers are a lot of work. Take her if you have the chance!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bonnie Meath-Lang	4.9	2	Theater		3	5	5	5	352227	3/15/10	She's the best Theatre teacher in the whole department! Take her classes if you have the chance! You'll never be bored!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bonnie Meath-Lang	4.9	2	Theater	256	5	5	5	5	352227	11/24/09	I had her for two Performing Arts classes and I loved her. She's always fun to have for a teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bonnie Meath-Lang	4.9	2	Theater		5	5	5	NULL	352227	2/11/04	Cool Person to work with!!! Had her for NTID's Performing arts courses and Productions! A++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	250	4	5	4	3	843077	1/28/13	Fair teacher. As long as you pay somewhat attention you will do fine on the quizzes and tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	201	3	5	5	5	843077	3/9/11	Good professor, picky with grading lab reports, but a nice guy and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	205	3	5	4	4	843077	1/31/10	Probably the best professor in the CE department, he's the only one who keeps his office door open, and if you need help with any CE class, even if he's teaching it, he'll help you out. Organized teaching style and clear about what he expects on tests. Can be dull, but has an *interesting* sense of fashion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	250	4	5	5	5	843077	11/12/08	I took Professor Melton for IDS and Assembly. He knows what he is talking about. Explains things very well. As long as your doing the work its is not hard to pass his class. He also cracks a joke or two in class. Definitely recommend this professor. He posts everything on mycourses. I found Assembly to be very dry and kinda boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	4	5	843077	5/4/06	Really good prof. Don't judge him by your experience in Freshman seminar, should you have it. Very fair grader, will give you as many points as he possibly can for work. Very accessable through e-mail and office hours. Also, easy-going during class and even cracks a joke or two. Highly recommended for CE Students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	250	3	5	4	4	843077	11/11/12	Excellent professor, as almost anyone who has had him would confirm. Extremely clear lectures, and makes sure you know what's going on. He does use slideshows every day, but uses them to help the lecture; he doesn't read them verbatim, which is a good thing. Definitely reccomend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	250	4	5	4	5	843077	4/24/10	One of the better professors I've had. He is always helpful both in and out of class, and very knowledgeable. He makes notes, and hints for the labs available myCourses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering		5	4	4	5	843077	5/27/09	I had Melton for a lab, and so didn't have much experience with him, most of the lab was run by the TA. He is pretty good from my experience, and helpful when asked questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering	356	3	4	5	4	843077	3/2/07	Great professor for the course. Extremely helpful. Shows you exactly what he wants. I recommend him for anyone taking the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roy Melton	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	4	3	843077	4/23/06	very easy grader, very helpful in lab class. take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Curtis Menton	3.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	2	4	1463186	11/14/11	Took him for Summer 2011 Crypto class. Good professor, obviously knows his material. He teaches all the stuff, rather than slacking off, like some professors do. He tries hard. Is really concerned about student doing well in the course. Is extremely helpful outside the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Curtis Menton	3.0	2	Computer Science	380	4	5	3	2	1463186	7/26/10	Brand new instructor, still working on his thesis. Really into the subject however has not matured as a teacher yet. Some difficulty in explaining material sometimes, lots of "ums," and critical typo. Very friendly and willing to try though even during class. If you email him a question about HW he will write a short essay back. Quizzes are fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Curtis Menton	3.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	1	3	1463186	6/13/11	I have to say, I can't understand a thing he says. His speaking style is so bad - it feels like I am listening to an undergrad student giving a nervous power point presentation filled with "ums" and incomprehensible sentences. I'm sure he is a nice guy but he needs to slow down the pace to explain things better. Needs to work on his teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	3	4	4	3	957452	3/3/12	Pretty good teacher overall. He brings a lot of real world experience to class. Tests aren't easy but the teacher is helpful if needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management		4	5	5	1	957452	11/10/11	Mergen presents a clear and organized world of Operations Management, that in the wrong hands, becomes a complicated mess. He makes an ultimately complex and difficult subject very accessible. Pay attention, and he will lead you methodically through the course. Tests are hard, and the work is time-intensive, but I never felt like I was unprepared.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management		2	5	5	2	957452	3/8/11	Tests are hard and subject is dry, but one of the nicest and beat professors I've ever had. Material is clear and well organized, excellent teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	3	5	5	4	957452	2/9/11	He was one of my favorite professors at RIT. He is extremely smart and humble. The material can be difficult but that's not his fault. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	4	4	5	2	957452	10/31/10	Way better Professor than Stevenson! The material is REALLY dry, but that's not his fault. I took both teachers and found Mergen to be WAY nicer and a lot easier. Tests are real easy if you read the book and review his power points. He really wants you to do well so he's pretty fair. Take him before even considering Stevenson!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management		3	5	5	4	957452	12/13/07	Mergen, is one of the best professors I have ever had. His class is alot of work but you will learn alot, in fact I have most likely learned more in his class then any other class. He also is a extremely nice person and very down to earth. A student called he a name in class one day and mergen was so nice and professional about the situation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	4	5	5	3	957452	2/22/12	Not really a difficult course, but can be a bit dry at times. Mergen tries to make it interesting and actively does consulting work in the field so he knows what it's like.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	4	5	5	3	957452	5/17/11	Good professor, very logical and has a passion for what he teaches, and is willing to help students struggling with a concept, but material is fairly straightforward.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management		1	5	3	3	957452	3/7/11	Class is not an easy one. The tests are extremely difficult (final wasn't cumulative) and make up a majority of your grade. He is helpful, but the material is bland and makes class move by slowwwww.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	106	4	5	5	3	957452	11/24/10	Doctor Mergen is very organized, clear in presentations and expectations, and prompt in returning the few assignments that are mandatory to hand in. He is very knowledgeable in the field, and never made a single mistake in presenting a concept or problem, or in grading. I would recommend him highly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	3	5	5	4	957452	2/2/09	Excellent teacher. Great person, always wants to help. Returns emails within minutes. Returns grades and feedback within days. Very knowledgeable guy. He is a walking encyclopedia. Class is difficult but he offers great help and wants his students to do well. Uses a lot of real-life scenarios from experience. I highly recommend Dr. Mergen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ehran Mergen	4.7	2	Management	401	2	4	4	3	957452	2/9/07	Mergen is a nice person. His tests are a little difficult, however and there is a lot of reading. If you don't keep up with the reading, you will fall behind. The material is dry, but Mergen tries to give you real life examples and even videos to help. The tests were just too hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology	210	5	5	5	3	1213086	12/22/11	Online Psychology course is definitely recommended. Weekly discussions and a final paper are all that is required. Fair and easy grading, and is very helpful if you have any issues.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	3	1213086	5/25/09	Really easy professor. My favorite online class so far. Discussions were based on interesting topics. One paper and one midterm. Not too difficult. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology	210	5	5	5	3	1213086	3/12/09	Very unconventional professor, he only teaches online or "blended" (online + one lecture/week) courses, but also a very effective teacher. His assignments have a very introspective approach to them, and you often find yourself connecting the concepts to your own life. Definitely a professor worth taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology	101	5	4	5	5	1213086	6/1/10	Online class- Class voted to only have Discussions (50%) and Paper (50%). So no Midterm or Final. Easy discussions, were good for thought. Paper was easy, pick a topic that interests you and write. Highly recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology		5	5	5	3	1213086	4/15/09	Wow is all I have to say! This teacher is amazing. He is so funny & interesting. Class is not mandatory, but it is so interesting that you end up going anyway! His assignments are all online and they couldn't get any easier. He makes you want to get into psychology!! Highly recommend this teacher!!! =]
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Meyer	4.8	2	Psychology		5	4	4	3	1213086	11/21/08	I was not looking forward to a 4 hour lecture from 6-10pm on Thursday nights, and I was pleased when there wasn't one. I had a blended course, so all work was completed online. Class attendance was not mandatory, but I assure you--if you go, you will probably discover one or two things about yourself that you hadn't known before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	210	5	5	4	4	728838	5/15/12	Pretty easy for Cultural Anthropology. Show up, and take optional notes for an hour, then a reading quiz which is discussed afterwards and you can use the material as well. Papers and tests were easy, you just had to put in at least some effort and you could get a very easy B if not an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	210	4	5	5	4	728838	6/2/11	One of my favorite teachers! You can tell that he enjoys what he does!! He has energy and, for me, he made me enjoy the class even more! Showed documentaries in class, which was helpful. He is there for you if you have any questions or even a chat after class- friendly guy! Highly recommend him! He is AWESOME!! Class: Cultural Anthropology
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	4	728838	10/25/10	Very nice and helpful. Knows what he's teaching. Easy A. Goes over test questions beforehand and short, 2-3 page essays every 2 weeks. Will even let you hand in essays late as long as you ask first.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	210	4	5	5	1	728838	9/25/10	Best professor I've ever had. Didn't think I'd even like the class, but he's awesome. Funny, engaging, and all around a nice person. Really knows what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	2	728838	11/19/09	Awesome teacher! Loves his job and got me very interested in the topic. Can't beat him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	210	4	5	5	2	728838	4/23/09	this was the best professor i have ever had at RIT he is very into what he is teaching which helps you to understand the work also the reading quizes are really easy and he gives you 4 papers but this is still a good class to take
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	4	4	2	728838	2/20/08	Took Cultural Anthropology with him, Amazing teacher, wacky and fun guy. looking for more classes with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		2	4	5	3	728838	12/3/07	Great guy. Material isnt too thrilling but he tries to keep students awake. 4 essays, easy inclass assignments and quizzes that are basically guarenteed 100 because they are gone over. Midterm and a final, not too hard, gives you a group of short answer questions, chooses random set to be on the actual test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	3	728838	10/17/07	Awesome teacher, so energetic, gave quizzes almost every class, but would go over the answers and let you correct them before turning it in. Learned a lot, good readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	5	4	2	728838	12/21/06	I failed his class due to not doing any work, but to be honest, the work load is very light. He also allows you to make things up right to the end of the quarter. Really nice guy, absolutely insane, but nice. Also, incredibly energetic. He's a madman. It's brilliant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	728838	6/13/11	Man nnn I never had a professor like him never great, funny, friendly, that was a family class. I remember a couple he is a darling he does. take you will never regret.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	1	728838	11/2/10	Awesome professor. Genuinely interested in his topic, enthusiastic to teach it. Has lots of great stories, and very funny. Helpful and pleasant. Fidgets when he talks :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	101	3	5	5	3	728838	9/30/10	Professor Middleton was an AMAZING teacher! I had no interest in this class, and 2 years after I took it I am still quoting his lectures and the articles he handed out. He was energetic, engaging and obviously well versed in his subject matter. I would suggest that everyone at RIT take his class regardless of your major!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	508	5	5	5	3	728838	1/21/10	Amazing professor, very enthusiastic and funny. Take any of his classes and you'll have a good time and most likely get a good grade and learn!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		5	4	5	1	728838	11/3/09	This guy is just crazy ! loves his job ! so he makes a boring class!, not so boring ! all you have to do is show up to class do the essay's and you will get an A at least ! He gives you the answers to the in class quiz's because he just wants to see if your in class !
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	101	4	4	5	5	728838	11/18/08	This man is AWESOME!!!!!!!! He has a lot of life experience and amusing stories (which he might repeat, hehe). Take him and you will see new perspectives which will serve you well in any career field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		3	4	4	4	728838	1/29/08	i've had him for many archaeology classes; he loves what he does and makes you at least somewhat interested in it. there's a lot of reading, and discussions on what's read. he usually gives a paper on a topic relavant to the course and has you present on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	4	4	3	728838	11/6/07	Nice guy, easy quizzes that you get to discuss in class. 3 total essays which are easy as well. Midterm and final are moderate, but he gives you a study guide. His only downfall is that he reads from powerpoint like it's his job, it's insanely boring!!! About 98 slides per class, he talks forever. Easy class, but boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	508	4	5	5	3	728838	12/23/06	easy to talk to, knowledgeable,patience,never tire, love his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	510	4	4	5	3	728838	11/17/06	Not a bad professor at all...although some of the weekly assigned readings may be quite a load, he actually strives to make the class as enthusiastic and fun as possible. The quizzes are absolutely EASY since they're taken in-class during discussions. Both the midterm and the final are a pain, however, since they relate most of the readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology	502	5	5	5	4	728838	11/8/06	he is the most comfortable professor I have ever talked to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		4	4	5	3	728838	10/6/06	Very energetic, teaches with enthusiasm and hes funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		5	5	3	5	728838	10/25/05	One of the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		3	5	5	2	728838	10/27/06	I didnt like to idea of learning about other cultures but this guy made it fun. He is very active and energetic, it keeps the class awake, he even tries to get to know the students names in the huge lecture hall room. The only downer is the essays and the readings. You get an essay to do every week and readings every week followed by a quiz.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	728838	1/21/06	He's really good as a professor. Knows the material, knows how to teach, and very helpful in every aspect
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Middleton	4.7	2	Anthropology		3	4	4	5	728838	10/18/05	Overall Good professor, a little scatterbrained, but not enough so that it detracts from the class. Not a bad choice for a prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	0	Writing		2	1	2	2	964859	11/28/12	Had to switch out of his class! He is very boring and spacey, didn't talk about writing at all for the two hour class period. Felt extremely uncomfortable in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing	319	4	5	5	5	964859	2/16/12	Awesome professor, definitely the best I've had as far as liberal arts goes. He can be sarcastic at times which I think is a good thing. Really chill class, we got to start 15 minutes late and often ended early. He cares about the students if you care enough to do the work. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing		2	5	4	3	964859	10/25/11	If your smart/witty you will get along fine with this teacher. Be smart, challenge his ideas once in a while and he will respect you. All in all class is very helpful if you try and your writing will improve as mine did. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU DON'T GET SARCASM! You will be left behind in conversations and most likely made fun of. Great Teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing		4	4	4	3	964859	10/24/11	Funny guy, but in his own world. Criticizes everything around him, quirky, sarcastic, but very entertaining. He is an adjunct,so he doesn't really care about much. He extended my class an extra 15 min. so he could get coffee in the morning. He is there to improve your writing. Give an interest, and work on being concise, and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	0	Writing		3	1	1	2	964859	2/14/09	You are back in high school with this guy. Assigns work, then doesn't collect it. Rambles ENDLESSLY. Completely full of himself. Constantly assigns taxing papers, expects you to view the "Backpack Writer" text as your bible. Gives somewhat good criticism but grades vary. Boring speaker, expect to fall asleep or get insulted at least once a week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing	227	2	5	4	1	964859	9/26/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing		4	5	5	1	964859	4/3/12	Interesting Professor. Didn't require many essays, but they had to be research topics. His criticism on essays is very constructive. Don't take this class if you can't write long essays- or do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing		5	5	5	2	964859	11/15/11	This guy was very good. I highly recommend. Just do the work and you will be rewarded with an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing		4	5	4	4	964859	10/25/11	An excellent teacher. Fun to talk to, good at sarcasm, and loves what he does. Doesn't collect any in-class work, fyi.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing	502	5	3	5	1	964859	5/9/11	Strange humor, fluent in sarcasm, very spacey, easily distracted, and likes things his way. Takes interest in your writing and is sincerely there to help you improve. Funny guy, he'll allow you to fool around too. Tries to be serious but often fails.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lloyd Milburn	3.9	2	Writing	227	3	3	5	3	964859	2/5/08	If you aren't afraid to challenge ideas academically, this is your professor. People who complain about Milburn are very good at nitpicking at shallow mannerisms. On a side note, I believe this man is very qualified to teach this class, has done good and deep writing, and is a good professor. Also recommended for AoE: writing the discipline.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	559	3	5	5	2	1210590	12/13/12	This guy is the real deal. I took Prof Selling with him & can honestly say if & when I get my first professional job, his class and how he presented things will have played a large part. Just a class act who is extremely passionate about how to effectively sell, teaching and his students. He teaches more than just concepts he teaches life!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	101	2	4	3	4	1210590	3/6/12	Overall, Prof. Miller made class both informative and entertaining. Read the text though, the quiz questions are based off of the text content, even if he did not go over the material. Fairly lenient grader with the group project, but a tough grader on exams. Exams are essay questions, so make sure you know your stuff! Offers extra credit work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	440	5	5	4	5	1210590	5/25/11	I don't understand the communication problem? He's always on facebook and always responded to my e-mails and chat within a few minutes. People are hating because they didn't show up to class, didn't hand in assignments, or blew the presentations off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	0	Business	363	3	2	2	4	1210590	5/17/11	Awful professor, picks favorites in the class, quizzes are not related to the material he teaches. The material he goes over in class just seems to come from the hip, and not very related to concepts in book. Impossible to get any sort of a response from.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	0	Business		3	1	3	4	1210590	4/20/11	fun lectures, easy quizzes but does not give any grades even at the end of the quarter. He grades you based on what " he knows you have learned" and not the actual grades you receive. I had an A by number but got a C because that is apparently how much I learned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		2	5	5	3	1210590	9/15/10	Joe lays down some pretty crazy rules at first (he doesn't particularly like e-mail, LOL) but he can give a pretty entertaining lecture. And it's not JUST entertaining... The class is taught around current events as applied to marketing, making it really relevant. Great prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		3	3	4	3	1210590	8/15/10	Professor is really awesome! I had him for summer quarter, and he was really laid back. He knows what he's talking about and puts a fun spin on things. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	363	4	5	5	3	1210590	10/21/09	great teacher with fun lectures had him in the spring for principles of marketing. his quizzes were easy and his lectures were always interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		4	4	4	2	1210590	4/15/09	One of the best teachers I've had so far, keeps class fun and interesting, easy to talk to after class. I highly suggest his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	0	Business		1	1	1	4	1210590	11/19/08	This professor is probably the worst professor I have ever had. We did not recieve ANY grades until after the final. We all went into the final not knowing if we were even passing the class, by then it is too late to do anything about it! We would go to him and ask him where we stand and he would be rude and talk down to us. Do NOT take his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	0	Business	771	2	2	1	1	1210590	5/29/12	Comes in and seems cool - but then underplays the tests and projects and you are totally blindsided. Completely disorganized and shows very little preparation or knowledge on anything relevant to what he is teaching. Totally just loafs off the book's slides. I wouldn't recommend him at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	559	5	4	4	5	1210590	10/14/11	If you don't get an A, you're an idiot. Miller is an awesome professor and 110% willing to help out (and COMMUNICATE) with his students. He's always on fb, just don't email him. Doesn't use txtbook much which is a waste. Tests are hard but as long as you kick ass on your presentation, you'll do well in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	1	Business	101	3	2	3	2	1210590	5/22/11	Laziest professor I've encountered at RIT. No form of lecture; just rants the entire time. If he likes your class you will be fine. Quizzes are straight from the text.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	0	Business		2	1	2	4	1210590	4/25/11	Bad Professor, not helpful, and never responds to communication=impossible to contact. Very tangential, and quizzes/tests are not related to the material he covers in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		3	5	5	4	1210590	10/3/10	Joe Miller is by far my favorite professor at RIT. He is super helpful with everything related to class as well as things outside the classroom - his thoughts never ceases to amaze and he presents the material in a way that is easy to understand and fun. Witty, fun, thought-provoking, and understanding. TAKE HIS CLASSES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		5	4	3	4	1210590	8/26/10	It is true that he didn't tell us most of our grades for the most part, but he kept the class fun and kept the students involved. If you asked him, he would tell you how you are doing and help you out to get a good grade. As long as you work hard on all the assignments and the presentations, he will take notice should reward you with no less than B
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business	363	3	5	4	5	1210590	5/20/10	Awesome professor. Extremely funny and down to earth and really knows the material he teaches and helps to facilitate learning on a very deep level that is both fun and intriguing. SIGN UP FOR HIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		3	4	4	3	1210590	6/17/09	I loved Professor Miller!! His classes were so much fun and everyone always looked forward to going to them every day. The class was really good for learning public speaking skills with the presentations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Miller	3.5	2	Business		5	5	4	2	1210590	2/10/09	I enjoyed his class a lot. He made things very easy and was always concerned about students' feedback about the class. We had 6 quizzes, homework and a group project and he offered extra credit, so it's easy to get a good grade. His lectures are interesting for the most part, because he presents the material so all can understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	2	Information Technology	350	4	4	4	5	1061109	6/26/12	Very nice guy. Knows the course material very well. Is slow with grading and can move a little fast over some subjects. Answers questions in class readily and is very approchable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	2	Information Technology		5	3	4	5	1061109	7/13/11	great guy, teaching is ok. he is very lenient with grades, but never got ANY until last couple weeks so you never know how you are. lectures had NOTHING to do with labs nor did labs to tests or tests to lecture, just really sloppy jumbled class/lab/test material although most of it is departmental wide stuff so not sure how much was his fault
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	1061109	9/19/08	I think he did a very good job at allowing Cyber Self Defense class to drive itself with the discussions brought about in class. No textbook, fair grader and very approachable. Show up to class, do the little work required, and get an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	2	Information Technology	351	3	4	4	5	1061109	11/16/11	Professor knows what he is talking about. Easy going, and is helpful as long as you ask questions. Only down side to his course is that he is slow with grading. Other than the grading, I have no problem taking other classes with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	1	1061109	2/3/11	This man is full of himself. He loves to overly explain useless parts of the lecture slides (which he rarely follows) to demonstrate his knowledge of the subject. Exam questions were always a shocker; he never prepared us for them because he was too busy drawing on the whiteboard. Asks obnoxiously specific questions in class. Just useless and awful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Minemier	3.5	1	Information Technology	220	5	4	2	3	1061109	11/26/07	Good guy, but not a good professor. Teaches off of a pre-made powerpoint, asks tons of hypothetical and rhetorical questions, and then doesn't explain himself. Overall, did a bad job at explaining the course material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Micheal Miran	3.8	2	Psychology		3	4	4	2	1041404	5/18/10	Pretty boring during lecture. Relies on the powerpoint too much. Assigns too many out of class papers. Good communication through email if you have a question.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Micheal Miran	3.8	1	Psychology	442	3	2	3	3	1041404	10/22/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Micheal Miran	3.8	2	Psychology	208	3	5	5	4	1041404	2/13/09	Dr. Miran is a really sweet man and if you go to him for help, he is always amenable to whatever you need and tries to answer your questions as best as he can. He listens well and he is very easy to approach!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	3	1195903	11/11/12	Great Teacher! Tests have right about of difficulty, shes always willing to help in a bind. Extremely knowledgeable, well spoken, and approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology		4	3	5	4	1195903	11/19/11	She is a great professor, and I learned quite a bit, but be warned. If you don't provide course feedback she won't round your grade, which feels unfair. The other issue is with the labs. They are so poorly written that it's funny. Sometimes the instructions would just say "do it" and you would just have to figure it out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology	413	2	5	4	4	1195903	10/21/11	Easy to understand, willing to take the time to meet with you if you have questions or need help. Answers emails quickly, ensures that you know what is going on in class. I would take her again for any other class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	5	1195903	3/25/10	She knows her stuff, answered all the questions i had. Made slides available. Just a really great class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1195903	11/3/08	Very helpful professor, probably the best I have had in the networking department. Answers emails immediately, and she knows her stuff. I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology	590	4	5	5	5	1195903	11/20/11	This was my third class I have taken with Mishra and I can still only say positive things about her. She is an excellent lecturer and is extremely helpful during lab periods. Course work is moderately difficult but she will help you out a lot of if you are struggling. She definitely knows what she is talking about, unlike some other professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology	413	5	5	5	4	1195903	10/29/11	Mishra is highly intelligent and a great professor. She can really break down tough concepts and make them easy to understand. She gives you lots of advice on how to do well on the graded assignments and makes every effort to help you. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology	413	4	5	5	5	1195903	5/18/10	This is my second time having Mishra as a professor and I have to say she is one of the best in the department. Very clear during the lecture, answers emails almost immediately, and makes all material available online. She knows her stuff and is a really nice person. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sumita Mishra	4.7	2	Information Technology	515	4	5	3	5	1195903	2/28/10	I enjoyed having Professor Mishra for Routing and Switching. She's a brilliant professor, and ensures that each student will succeed. Hope that I'll have her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	1	Economics	401	4	2	3	4	574221	4/13/13	She is an American patriot. Most of her lectures are based on politics decisions and all. She compliments American companies and their products but when it comes to international companies she trashes them. She choses who she would help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		4	4	4	3	574221	11/17/12	Good teacher for Economic Forecasting Lecture, and a relatively easy A if you just go to class and hand in the assignments on time. Heard horror stories about her in other classes, but for this particular class she was nice and tried to help the students as much as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	211	4	3	4	3	574221	5/17/12	My first online class, so I don't have much to compare to. Didn't contact students much, but if you contacted her she would answer your questions. Also, spelled everything out in syllabus and content on myCourses if you look for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	402	1	5	3	4	574221	2/2/12	She is a very hard professor, but you will learn A LOT from her. Take good notes because that's how you will study. What she lectures is not in the book. There are 3 tests composed of 3-4 questions, and there is no partial credit. You will also have to do 5 take home quizzes. Don't take her if you're looking for an easy A. You will have to earn it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		1	5	5	5	574221	8/8/11	BEST PROF AT RIT!! I took Intro to Micro, Macro, Forecasting, History of Econ Thought and Int'l Tade & Finance. She teaches all of the classes very similarly. She knows her stuff & if you put in the effort, you can learn a lot & have fun. I switched from a Marketing major to an Econ major because of Dr. Mitchell. She's my favorite teacher by far!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	455	2	5	4	5	574221	3/12/11	Excellent teacher but you have to work for the A. Engaging professor that knows her****, but also likes to digress and have fun. To get an A, I studied between 7-10 hours per test. I've taken 3 classes with her and all were similar taught similarly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	100	2	4	4	5	574221	8/30/10	Awesome teacher!! Hard and a lot of work but it's worth all of my time and effort. If you put in the studying time and attend all the classes, there's no reason you should not do well in her class. She is a great professor!! I absolutely LOVE her classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	211	2	4	4	4	574221	10/27/09	She is a great profeessor. Other students I know struggle so much with these concepts, but with her teaching, its not as hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	402	2	5	5	3	574221	4/29/09	LOVE HER!!! hard but sooo worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	4	4	3	574221	2/3/09	Although extremely liberal a very good professor overall. Attend every class and take notes and you should be fine for tests. Can be rude but also funny. Leads steroetypical college class with lectures. Does not use notes and is a very intelligent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	201	4	5	5	5	574221	3/26/13	Awesome teacher!!! Helps students a lot and gives very clear lectures. 2 non-cumulative exams, including final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	5	2	1	574221	5/31/12	Shes a very good teacher with lots of good information! Wish she helped out the deaf kids more because they had a hard time taking notes while she takes so many graphs! Overall good teacher, you have to earn your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	574221	4/30/12	It's a tough class, but you will definitely get a lot out of it. If you look past the desire to get an easy A, you'll find that this professor is extremely valuable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	5	5	2	574221	1/25/12	I had her for macro. I would put this class in my top 5 classes I got the most out of in my 4 years in college. Homework is long but readings are extremely relevant. Online homework is easy and boosts your grade. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Skills in researching economic data you learn in class are invaluable to anyone in the business field
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		3	5	5	5	574221	4/6/11	excellent teacher she outlines whats going to happen in class and tells how to pass it. She explains how she grades. she keeps students interested with by asking questions. The assignments can be hard but she tells you exactly how to do them favorite teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	4	3	2	574221	12/3/10	So stressful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	1	Economics		5	1	4	3	574221	11/30/09	Dr Mitchell had a 4.0 as a double major - two facts she makes you well aware of from day one. In the field of economics, Dr. Mitchell is knowledgeable, however one should avoid taking anything else for face value (e.g. Mexico a memeber of OPEC). You also get the idea she probably reads sites like ratemyprofessor so, hi Mitchell
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		4	5	5	4	574221	5/27/09	I loved her class. She kept me intrested throughout the whole quarter, did not miss a lecture. She knows the stuff and gives you another perspective of what is given in the text, though I did not use as much because if you want to well in her class - attend, take notes and listen carefully what she says. Greatest teacher I have ever had!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	511	1	3	5	3	574221	4/28/09	She is GREAT at explaining economics. She always has a real-life to relate everything with. Some cons are she has the toughest exams, be prepared to do horrible on ur first test with her especially if you haven't taken her before. Also she is the type of the teacher that thinks whatever she says is correct and dismisses your opinion on a subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	1	Economics		1	3	3	4	574221	1/27/09	Not a mean person, just didn't cut you breaks when you did tests. Tests were comprised of 3-4 questions so you had to do well on the tests to pass the class. Same thing with the final, was only 4 questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	1	Economics	403	1	1	4	3	574221	7/30/08	She is tough, while she goes over the material well in class, if you aren't used to her tests, expect to do poorly on your first midterm. Another evaluator said it as well, she only has 3-4 questions per test, so if you get only a part of the question wrong, you get no partial credit, and you end up getting a C. Garbage, dont take the risk, take so
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		4	4	5	5	574221	8/20/07	If you are in the Learning Community don't miss her class! However, if your not one of the lucky few steer clear of her. She wont cut you any breaks like she will for the learning community students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	0	Economics	301	2	2	2	2	574221	10/19/06	I had her for ecnonomics. She was awful. She not keep you interested and she moved too fast in class. if you didn't answer a question perfectly the way she wanted it, she would embarass you in class. Was not helpful on tests. Made tests 3 questions, so if you missed one you could not get partial credit and you then got a C on it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	0	Economics		2	2	2	3	574221	11/17/05	Decent Prof. Fair grading policy. You must go to class and take good notes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	5	5	5	574221	8/31/05	Knows her stuff, you need your notes, fall behind get help from her imediatly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		1	5	5	5	574221	8/30/05	Marvelous Professor with an indeph understanding of both mathamatics and economics. I learned Stat from here in just over an hour. Best investment that COLA has made in it's Economic Program, IMHO
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	1	Economics		3	3	3	3	574221	2/26/05	Fairly decent teacher, kind of intimidating though and if you go to get help she makes you feel stupid. This class is lecture based, you must take EXCELLENT notes and study them for the three non-cumulative tests. She gives weekly hw assignments and drops the two lowest (hw) grades
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics	201	1	5	4	1	574221	11/2/07	Study hard, rewrite class notes and you will do fine. You learn alot in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	4	3	2	574221	12/6/06	Difficult teacher but always willing to help Easy assighnments help your grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		2	5	4	4	574221	5/19/06	She flys through concepts, but that is the nature of the class. You must take thorough notes and go to lectures. Only bad thing is there are 2 test: midterm and final. So if you mess up one, youre kinda screwed. She is really nice tho, and very helpful if need it. You just have to keep up!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	2	Economics		3	5	4	3	574221	11/11/05	Prof. Mitchell knows what she is talking about. Her lecture style makes it easy for you to take notes, and her reviews that she gives before tests let you know what you will be expecting. 3 tests a quarter (no real final). "Quizzes" once a week that are take-home. Very helpful if you have any problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeannette Mitchell	3.8	0	Economics		3	1	1	1	574221	8/31/05	She's very strict and her tests are totally absurd- don't take her, instead take Mitchell Redlo or Lee.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		1	1	1	1	432461	2/14/11	She is awful! Insulted and hurt the students feelings. DO NOT TAKE HER!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		1	1	1	1	432461	5/4/06	she tends to give students with unfair. She is lousy with her feedback. She tends to busy for herself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		3	1	1	5	432461	2/2/06	SHE IS AWFUL!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		1	1	1	1	432461	2/7/05	AWFUL TEACHER!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		2	2	2	3	432461	3/7/07	Alright. I had her my freshman year, and I would NEVER again take her course. She is absolutely unfair in her grading and just plain unintelliglible. She doesn't make sense half the time, and it is easy to despise her character as she is sweet & syrupy in her communication, but her actions ultimately reflect the opposite. Lorna Mittelman --> bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lorna Mitelman	1.1	0	English		1	1	1	1	432461	3/15/06	She needs to be fired! Worst teacher EVER!! She gives you a C if you do A effort work, or F if you do C effort. You get the idea. She is pretty anal.. Beware of the MITTLEMANTOR!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Monahan	5.0	2	Health Science		5	5	5	5	576658	2/19/10	Seriously, this dude knows women. The women studies appeared to be a boring class but Monahan made it extremely fascinating... REALLY fascinating.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	2	Engineering		3	5	4	4	1207389	11/13/11	Really great professor, the type you always want to have in college. His depth of knowledge in the material is incredible, not an easy class but commit yourself and you will succeed. Always available for extra help or questions. One of the best professors I've taken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	2	Engineering		3	5	5	2	1207389	11/27/10	Great teacher. Always trying to help. Uses book every night for homework. Lots of homework but if you do it you shouldn't get below an 80. He wants you to understand and will help as long as you ask for it or participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	2	Engineering	303	2	4	3	3	1207389	8/27/09	Decent professor, had him for statics & strength of materials. He can be tough old man at times. One day he'll say how well the class is doing, then say how little we know later in the week, you get use to it tho. Very willing to help in office hours. Gave extra credit. I would take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	2	Engineering	303	4	5	4	3	1207389	1/26/11	Had him for Strengths of Materials. Great professor!! Tests were fair, and not that hard. 3-4 homework assignments due per week, but very helpful at office hours. I would HIGHLY recommend Professor Merrill!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	2	Engineering	302	3	4	4	4	1207389	9/7/10	Good teacher. Lots of homework but It does help you learn Statics. Has a grader do grading, so don't blame him for that. I would take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Merrill	3.8	0	Engineering		1	1	1	2	1207389	1/26/09	His grading is very inconsistent, avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	2	Biochemistry	321	3	5	4	2	1400410	4/15/11	Dr. Michel is a very good professor. It is nice to have someone who is so considerate of the needs of her students. I learned a lot in this course even though I was really nervous in the beginning. I think a lot of people are intimidated by complex science and blame it on the professor, but they need to take responsibility for themselves.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry		4	1	1	5	1400410	11/14/10	This class was such a waste of time since she doesnt teach anything. She thinks she is actually helping students but she isnt teaching biochemistry. She's barely teaching high school freshmen biology
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry		2	1	1	5	1400410	11/5/10	She simply can not teach. Often she patronizes students and assumes that everyone knows nothing. She barely skimps the surface of what is biochemistry and instead focuses on some inane fact as her talking point. She is unprofessional and often appears that she just tosses things together. She doesnt even use powerpoints. She's beyond useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry		2	1	2	2	1400410	11/1/10	She made us memorize tons of useless things that we didn't need. Tests were hard, with her grading even worse. Hated the class, hated the way it was taught, recommend taking the other prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	2	Biochemistry		4	5	5	3	1400410	1/22/10	AWESOME TEACHER! Super nice too. Dr. Michel makes metabolism seem "cool". Exams are pretty easy if you attend class. Exams are based on notes taken in class. She doesnt make you memorize mechanisms. No cumulative final!! Just final poster project - EASY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry		2	1	1	5	1400410	11/19/10	useless teacher.don't know her teaching.waste my time and waste my tuition money.advice taking another prof.hate her and hate her style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	2	Biochemistry	502	3	5	5	4	1400410	11/6/10	Dr michel is one of my favorite profs at RIT!! This class is super hard but she answers my questions and is really helpful. plus no boring powerpoint lectures!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry	502	2	1	1	4	1400410	11/3/10	Teaching methods were terrible. Her notes leave out most of the information from the book. Her grading on tests were harsh and inconsistent. I feel like I haven't learned anything I was supposed to. She also never explains anything very clearly and you end up having to teach yourself. I highly recommend taking this with another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lea Michel	2.3	0	Biochemistry	502	2	1	1	2	1400410	11/1/10	This teacher was absolutely horrible. One of the first teachers to make me want to change majors. The first thing she told us on day one was "I will never make you memorize anything" which is a total lie, if you dont memorize the entire book your done for. Her tests need to have txtbook answers word for word or she takes off points and you fail
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sughey Miguez	1.7	0	Languages	561	3	2	2	5	1097960	11/16/09	She can't teach.Doesn't know english very well to answer the questions; there were many times when students asked and she just mumbled something. Assigns a lot of homework. After taking spanish with Roberto Perez, this class was so boring
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sughey Miguez	1.7	0	Languages		2	2	2	4	1097960	1/25/08	(Intermediate Spanish 1) Not a horrible teacher. Not a good teacher either. Her Spanish accent is a little bit hard to understand, and I didn't feel like she understood English that well. Outside of class she was a little more helpful, but she didn't reply to emails. She assigns a lot of homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sughey Miguez	1.7	0	Languages	205	2	1	1	4	1097960	3/31/09	Very hard to understand. Does not explain things very well. Speaks Spanish the entire class in a beginning Spanish class, so no one knows what she is saying. Assigns pointless homework and lots of it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Renee Miller	2.8	2	Biology		3	4	4	2	1404192	5/19/10	An outstanding teacher whose efforts and enthusiasm towards making students understand the science behind the facts are unparalleled. Don't take her class if you just want to memorise stuff and use MCQ. Take it if you want to learn and be able to explain what you learnt. Finally, a class where I could apply scientific logic and intelligence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Renee Miller	2.8	0	Biology	404	1	1	2	3	1404192	3/11/10	Teacher is horrible. She really needs to stick to research since her place is clearly not with undergraduate students. She will talk down to students, average tests grade are about 63 and average letter grade a C. With those grades, she told us in class that there was nothing wrong with her teaching style, we were in the wrong!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Miokovic	4.5	2	Art History		3	5	4	5	1454047	11/22/10	Had him for 20th c. art since 1950. 66% of the grade: take-home essays for the midterm & final. The other 33% a museum paper and "discussion" index cards that we submit at the end of every class. At first he always spent the full 3 hours lecturing, which put me to sleep, but then he brought in films. Allows rewrites and is very understanding. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	1	Science		2	2	3	2	67470	9/6/12	He's smart i'll give him that... However the class is dreadful! His homeworks are online quizzes you get 2 attempts, his tests are identical to last quarter(s) and years before that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	0	Science	273	1	1	2	4	67470	2/7/11	To me a teacher IS NOT GOOD if they curve the crap out of tests. Shouldn't have to, which he definately did or his whole class would fail. Class test average with 12 pt curve - 64%. Thats out of 60 kids. Is he doing his job? You tell me. There goes my $2000. Thanks RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	0	Science	273	2	1	2	1	67470	4/14/08	TERRIBLE! The lectures are terrible and he goes through them rediculously fast. The tests and final are 100% multiple choice scantron graded. If it wasn't for the book I would have learned nothing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	2	Science		4	4	4	3	67470	11/29/05	Gives the craziest Curves. one Test the curve was over 20 points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	2	Science		4	3	4	3	67470	2/24/05	Do NOT use his textbook, it's full of errors. But he isn't a bad guy himself, from my online experience.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	0	Science	273	2	1	1	1	67470	5/13/12	Horrible professor. only reason i passed the class is because the TA was so helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	0	Science		3	2	2	4	67470	2/24/09	The professor seemed cool at first. He uses a tool called iClicker and mine had problems. I reported it and the iClicker team said it was a bad one. They sent him a message and he responded saying I am getting no credit for it. His book (he wrote it) is terrible. Mistakes all over. His lecture is his book, so his lecture is also terrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	2	Science	215	2	5	5	4	67470	5/18/06	great professor, great courve but kinda hard test
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	2	Science		5	5	4	4	67470	5/3/05	Good teacher - Likes to give curve points. Presents the material well (even if it is pretty much out of the book). Text has changed - which is a good thing as the book was full of errors. Nice guy always available and willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Massoud Miri	2.9	2	Science		2	5	5	5	67470	2/17/05	Dr Miri is the best proffessor. He is very helpful inside the class as well as outside the class.He has no ego problems. He can understand student's problems and he can solve them easily.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Mislan	5.0	2	Networking Security & Systems		5	5	5	5	1752710	2/12/13	I had Professor Mislan for Cyber Self Defense, and I really enjoyed his class. He enriched the curriculum with relevant stories from his personal life, and made sure that every student understood material. He seemed to be a master of his field. All in all, I would recommend him to another student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Mislan	5.0	2	Networking Security & Systems		4	5	5	5	1752710	10/29/12	He made class interesting and I always enjoyed going. Definitely choose him!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sheila Mitchell	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	84540	9/19/05	This lady had a heart attach when I was taking her class. We didn't think she was ever going to come back and I never saw her in the next four years. She was great and may have even been too easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sheila Mitchell	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	84540	12/17/04	she's a good and sweet teacher, who's so friendly and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sheila Mitchell	3.7	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	84540	10/26/05	She can't teach. She makes mistakes all the time, which makes it even harder to understand. I was lucky that I took the class in high school otherwise I wouldn't have known anything. She does let you use cheat sheets on every quiz and test though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sheila Mitchell	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	84540	7/14/05	She was a real great professor. She lets you use cheat sheets on all the tests and the final. She encourages questions and goes over each question very well. She doesn't collect homework but still should do it. She's also helpful outside of class. And she gives bonuses and extra credit. I got an A in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sheila Mitchell	3.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	NULL	84540	11/19/02	She just plain sucks
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	2	Not Specified		4	5	4	4	1056935	1/10/13	I have Gary for Form and love his class--there's no other way I'd be up at 8 every Monday morning. And then I had Roy Cripps for Graphic Viz and it was awful. I switched, and I feel much more comfortable in his class because his critique is encouraging, not crushing. Yes, he talks a lot but it isn't obnoxious, he's funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	5	1056935	1/25/12	Gary is awesome. He's like that person you meet and you wish they were in your family. Above it says he's not worried about the process: that's because that is something you do on your own time; he tells what works/how to make it work. Also above says he is obnoxious: no that's just old people sarcasm. and he IS FUNNY. he is amazing. TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	1	Not Specified		1	3	2	5	1056935	1/24/10	He generally knows what he's talking about but qhen it comes down to it his teaching style is backwards. he focuses too much in the end product and not how you get there. for graphic visualization if you have the option choose ron lytel instead
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	2	Not Specified	331	2	4	5	3	1056935	11/16/07	Great teacher. Goes into great detail. Teaches Form and Graphic Visualization. Can be anal sometimes but is only striving for perfection. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	2	Not Specified		2	4	4	4	1056935	9/25/12	I took 3 classes with Gary, Graphic Visualization 1-3. Gary focuses on the end product because that is what matters. I am now much better at rendering. Gary is fair and knows what he is talking about. He will also take extra time for every student, because he genuinely cares. Definitely take for all graphic visualization. GREAT CLASSES Thanks Gary!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	2	Not Specified	348	2	4	5	5	1056935	5/27/11	Genuinely interested in his topic and is enthusiastic to teach it. He focuses not on the grades but strives for improvement and each student personal best over the quarter. Most caring professor I've ever met, but as expected, if you show no interest in improving your skills he will not go out of his way to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Molinari	3.8	0	Not Specified		3	1	2	4	1056935	1/10/08	His experience pertaining to the field in which he teaches is very questionable. He used to teach gymnastics... But aside from being obnoxiously cocky and pretentious, he seems to care about teaching others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Mondschien	5.0	2	Information Technology	218	5	5	5	4	1110001	2/28/10	Will is an awesome professor ... you learn a lot from his class, but he doesn't demand much. Incredibly laid back, and very dedicated for an adjunct. Rock on, Will.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Mondschien	5.0	2	Information Technology	217	5	5	5	3	1110001	3/12/08	Will is a great professor. He made programming really easy to understand and is lightyears better than most of the other IT professors. Definitely recommend his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Mondschien	5.0	2	Information Technology	220	5	5	5	4	1110001	2/2/09	He was an amazing teacher that spoke to the class on a more informal level and drew many analogies that help me and my classmates learn complex material by relating it to concepts that we already understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Franz Mondschien	5.0	2	Information Technology	217	5	5	5	4	1110001	6/10/08	Monschientastic!!! Great teacher. Helped me a lot and I would recommend him to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Monikowski	4.5	2	History	101	3	5	5	4	561794	10/10/07	Great Teacher! Fare and sincere. Goes above and beyond. Has a lot of great insight, funny and serious stories, and interesting, thought provoking comments

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Monikowski	4.5	1	History		3	2	4	5	561794	3/26/05	If you read the book and know everything in the chapter, you'll do well on tests (all m/c and TF) - A lot of the questions are random small facts, so make sure you know everything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Monikowski	4.5	2	History		3	4	5	4	561794	1/26/05	great professor. used to be a lawyer and tells stories a lot. good at speaking to the class. tests are T/F, multiple choice, and sometimes short answer.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Monikowski	4.5	2	History		3	5	5	5	561794	8/31/05	Awesome professor! Be prepared to laugh. He knows a lot about his stuff. Read the chapter, participate in the class discussions (Class is usually an open forum and he encourages open discussion) and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Monikowski	4.5	2	History		4	5	5	3	561794	3/3/05	Good teacher. A lot of experience. Native indian and used to work for the govt as a lawyer. Tries to get class off on interesting discussions - has a lot of stories. Tests were basically from book and were T/F, and multichoice. No projects/papers either. Nice guy who'll try to keep you interested
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	0	Sociology	101	5	1	1	3	1333368	1/28/13	She originally seems very nice but,as the class went on I realized that she's always so scatter and unorganized. She kept confusing what she was teaching for this course for a whole other course. Lastly, I was getting a bad vibe; drops a lot of unnecessary comments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	5	1333368	1/30/11	Easy A- Test were take home, with one project at the end of the quarter. Videos during class kept the class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	2	Sociology	210	5	4	3	3	1333368	10/27/09	Very nice, but slightly submissive (less mature classmates may get a little out of hand). She also works at MMC, so she sometimes seems a little out sync, but in the end it means you get easy quizes and lots of homework extension. Easy term paper, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	2	Sociology	101	5	5	5	5	1333368	11/7/12	Crazy easy, very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	2	Sociology	101	5	4	5	5	1333368	1/30/11	Easy A - Every test was take home, one group project at the end of the quarter. Used videos which kept class interesting. Was usually late, but let class out early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shahin Monshipour	3.9	2	Sociology	210	5	5	4	3	1333368	10/5/09	Nice teacher, though typically late for class. Tests are incredibly easy and overall it's a crazy easy class. I'd take it for an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Moore	2.1	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	1641925	5/17/12	I had him for College Algebra and he is a very good professor, helpful and easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Moore	2.1	0	Mathematics	217	2	2	2	3	1641925	1/29/12	Unclear teaching, I still feel like how he comes to his conclusions is best described as "magic" rather than going through a process. To be fair though, he does often ask if the class has any questions but no one asks anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Moore	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	1641925	11/21/11	Avoid him at all costs. He doesnt teach, he describes how he does it and he just "knows the answer"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Moore	2.1	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	3	1641925	2/22/12	Not good professor. He writes the math problems on the board too quickly and doesn't exactly tell us steps to find the solution. Before the final exam, he would give us final review packet and only 20% of problems is relevant to the final exam. When I took final exam, most of the problems were never taught in the class. Avoid this bad professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Moore	2.1	0	Mathematics	205	1	2	2	1	1641925	1/27/12	Have him currently for Discrete Math for Tech 1 and he just makes the most ridiculous things to take into concept as if everyone is a CS student. Honestly, he's really difficult to follow as he just "knows" all theorum's and almost seems to go out of cirriculum. Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Moran	4.5	2	Science Technology & Society		3	5	5	3	1016230	3/8/08	Excellent teacher. I've had him on campus and by distance learning. Extremely clear presentations. Participates heavily in online courses. Generously gives credit even for late assignments. I've learned a lot in his courses and look forward to next time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Moran	4.5	2	Science Technology & Society		3	4	4	2	1016230	8/12/07	VERY GOOD INSTRUCTOR. ESPECIALLY, FOR OLDER STUDENTS IN THE WORKING WORLD, VERY FAIR, HELPFUL. WILL CHANGE GRADES AS NECESSARY. HAVE HAD PLEASURE OF HIS INSTRUCTION TWICE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	2	Biology		4	4	5	2	1251356	2/3/10	She makes it very clear what you need to study for each quiz and practical. She's fair and friendly and comfortable to be around, enough to admit you don't know what you're doing or if you made a mistake in lab. I recommend her for General Biology Lab over the other instructors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	2	Biology		2	5	3	4	1251356	9/16/09	Lab instructor. She has tons of typos in her homework assignments which are graded ambiguously. Nice person though once you get to know her. Study on your own since she won't tell you what she's specifically looking for.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	1251356	2/19/09	She is really amazing professor. She is very helpful and she's ecouraged you to be better. Her quiz style is very clear and challenged. If you study hard, then you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	2	Biology		2	3	5	2	1251356	1/29/09	Well lets see...she says "ok?" very quickly and often after her sentences. It's a lab professor so not much to expect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	1	Biology		2	1	5	1	1251356	11/19/09	Super nice and friendly in lab and was always available to answer questions or review. Quizzes could be a bit hard, but she graded fairly. Learned a lot in that lab!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	1	Biology		1	2	3	3	1251356	2/22/09	Stricted grader known to man. Don't even waste your time. If you want a really good professor that won't mark you off for having your shoes untied, go with Kristen Kimble. Much better professor and much less of a headache.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Morgan	4.0	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	1251356	2/17/09	She is an awesome professor. You would lucky to have her as your Lab professor. She is very helpful. Please take this course with her. You will be lucky if you do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Mueller	5.0	2	Business		4	5	5	2	1291343	5/28/09	I took Proj. Mngmt & Practice online went into the class thinking it would be overwhelming. It turned out to be great! As long as you are involved in the course (Discussions) turn in things on time and show interest, you will get at least a B! He's really fast at replying to emails and helping!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sriramachandra Mur	4.5	2	Marketing	363	4	5	4	5	1698575	3/7/12	The RIT scheduling system has him listed as SRIRAMACHANDRA MUR, but his real name is Raj Murthy. See his other RMP reviews here: http://is.gd/sDm6AS - He's an amazingly good prof, knows marketing, tell stories, gives great examples, and is willing to help in any way he can. No mid/final, 4 quizzes, 5-6 hmwks, 1 large ongoing project. highly recomm.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	2	Electrical Engineering		1	5	3	3	1407582	5/23/11	Great professor. As many have stated, he does give a lot of work but only does so because he cares that his students learn. As for office hours, its true that he can be very busy. However, he is often there on the weekends. From a personal standpoint I have been asked questions related to what he has taught during Career Fair and interviews.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	1	1	3	1407582	11/4/10	unless you know the subject already you will hate his class. Gives way to much work and is always too busy getting coffee or helping out just one student, so unless you are that one lucky student he is useless. Takes forever to grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		2	1	2	3	1407582	9/17/10	Never take his class unless you already know the subject
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering	618	1	1	2	4	1407582	2/11/10	Very smart men, but treats you if you know what your doing when you clearly don't, doesn't answer questions. Nearly got fired for how he treated students
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	3	3	1407582	1/26/11	Cares for the students, and very helpful in office hours. Really Nice professor, but not the best at teaching. Go to class and don't fall behind, and will be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering		1	3	1	2	1407582	11/4/10	He is a nice guy but not a very good professor. He gives way too much work (10 labs and homework). He takes years to get back grades and is inconsistent. It seems like he is never at his office hours and leaves at random times during labs. He would be a good upper level professor but not in a entry level setting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Antonio Mondragon	2.1	0	Electrical Engineering	438	1	1	1	3	1407582	3/21/10	Screwed students over when it came to grading and returning assignments. Was not available for signoffs on lab reports outside of lab. During finals week blew off students to go watch Heroes. Strong accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	1	Languages		2	2	3	5	124899	4/21/09	She is very knowledgeable but obviously has her favorites. Be very careful with what you do and say. If she finds something she doesn't like she will try to embarrass you in front of the class. Nice outside of class, but in class she's her own dictator. Work hard, don't skip, and never show a hint of weakness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	2	Languages		3	3	5	4	124899	11/1/07	At the beginning of the quarter I really didn't care for her, but by week 7 I quite liked her. Proper English grammar and spelling are of high value to her. Just do the reading. She does occasionally give pop quizzes. A little long-winded, but you wind up getting all of your questions answered and knowing the concepts through-and-through.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	2	Languages	310	3	5	5	4	124899	2/4/07	I absolutely love her. She can be intimidating sometimes, but you just have to be on her good side. Do your work, show up to class, and respect that she is the teacher and you'll do great. If you really want to learn something, take Dr. Monikowski's classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	0	Languages		1	2	1	5	124899	5/6/06	Be ready to cry!!!! You will work your butt off and it will be for nothing. If she does not like you then you will not do well in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	2	Languages	320	2	5	4	2	124899	2/18/09	Great Professor. She really knows what she is talking about and has had a lot of good experiences she will share with you. Make sure you do your homework on time, show up to class, and dress appropriately and you'll do well. Study for midterm!!!! "Chuck Norris" of ethics. If an ethical dilemma approached her she'd roundhouse kick it in the face.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	2	Languages	201	2	4	5	5	124899	10/10/07	Dr. Monikowski is one of the best professors I've ever had. Yes, she can be a little intimidating, but if you aren't ready to do the work and learn about interpreting than why are you in this field? Taker her if you get the chance...in the long run you will be thankful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	124899	11/18/06	Very intimidating but she knows her stuff. Maybe she is a bit biased, but it's usually towards the people she knows will be successful. I really enjoy her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christine Monikowski	3.6	1	Languages		1	2	4	NULL	124899	2/19/03	Dr. Christine Monikowski is militant and be prepared to cry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics	301	3	1	2	4	1486853	9/16/12	Horrendous professor. Not only is she extremely dull, but she is very negative and is flustered quite easily. She teaches straight form the power-point and does not elaborate well on the topic. You will learn better from the textbook. Great topic, but absolutely horrible professor. If you want to take Astronomy, do NOT do it with this woman.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics	211	3	2	2	3	1486853	11/29/11	Dr. Monsay is a fair professor. She is extremely boring, but if you do all of the work it isn't that bad. She has pre-lab and post-lab quizes which are hard, mastering physics problems, and her tests are difficult. But, if you put the time in you will get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	1	Physics		3	4	2	2	1486853	4/21/11	Lectures are not worth going to, they are extremely boring and you'll learn more from reading the book. She gets flustered and off topic while teaching. She is very nice and helpful at her office hours, but is very slow to return tests and takes points off for ridiculous reasons. If you've taken physics before you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics	211	1	2	2	1	1486853	1/31/11	Very boring teacher. Lecture is brutally dull. She is not on top of grades. Its week 8 and we still haven't gotten things back from week 1. I won't know if i failed or not til its too late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics		2	1	2	3	1486853	10/25/10	Avoid this teacher at all costs I spent more time with the TA because he was able to teach us more. Her lectures are all over the place and she seems like she doesn't understand the information. She doesn't seem confident at all when she talks to the class and gets easily led off topic. Try to take this with another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	2	Physics		4	5	3	4	1486853	3/3/12	She is boring at the first few 3 weeks&she becomes better after that. Try to make joke &ask students questions for paying attention to her. she doesn't penalize for mistakes in homework(do thousands ones). drop the lowest quiz and increase midterm exams score by replacing the lowest one with final.I get A .she is not too bad as Others Can Be Worse
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics	211	3	1	1	1	1486853	11/4/11	Not only is she a sub par professor, she doesn't really seem to understand how to put together and run a course. Lecture consists of her doing problems straight from the book, and 'lab' is just another 2 hour lecture. She gives online quizzes and Mastering physics HW and constantly changes due dates at the last minute. Very frustrating class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics		2	2	1	4	1486853	2/2/11	Not a good teacher, forces students to learn and do physics exactly like her or massive points are taken off. Super confusing math techniques. Unfortunately for college phys 1 is either her or Zielinksi who is also terrible, good luck!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evelyn Monsay	1.9	0	Physics	210	1	1	1	3	1486853	1/25/11	Worst professor I have ever had, I actually had to drop the course because of how poor the quality of teaching was. She did not give good examples, is far too strict about naming conventions, and lost nearly 30 students after a test due to the fact that she told us not to study formulas that were vital to the test. Do NOT take this professor!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	482	3	5	5	3	264429	1/2/13	Extremely helpful in class. Everything was crystal clear. Lets you use the book, hw, hw solutions, notes, pretty much everything on tests. Tests were very fair. Homework assigned was very challenging and he graded it very strictly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	3	264429	10/18/11	Be prepared to be spend adleast 6 hrs outside class a week doing homework. Very Smart man, known's the material inside and out. As most people have already said, Very helpful and willing to help. EE Department DR.MOON #GOAT
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	360	3	5	5	5	264429	2/10/11	The best professor and most dedicated in the EE department at RIT hands down. The only thing he cares about is that his students learn the material, He is easy to understand in lectures and extremely helpful. The tests are kinda hard but if you do the hw you will do fine on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	1	264429	12/15/10	homeworks are very challenging, but he is very good about helping through email and in office hours. tests are open book, open notes. class takes a lot of effort, but overall not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	481	4	5	5	4	264429	8/7/09	A god among men! You can not do much better then Dr. Moon in the EE department. He knows the material like the back of his hand and justifies it in his teaching. He also is the most approachable kind man, which can only be explained for his love for teaching. If you have the chance to take him for a class I wouldn't even hesitate, seriously!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	712	5	5	5	5	264429	8/3/06	Amzingly Best Prof in EE Dept
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		4	4	4	3	264429	10/24/05	Very fair grader, tests aren't too bad if you do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	712	4	5	5	5	264429	3/10/05	Very good professor. One of the smartest men you'll ever encounter. I was luck to take him in my final year.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	264429	11/17/04	Dr. Moon is an excellent teacher. Covers everything you need to know, is very organized, always willing to help, open book/note tests, and is a fair/lenient grader. You can easily get a good grade, but you'll actually learn a lot, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	264429	5/6/04	Very helpful and was always helpful in making sure concepts were understood.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	1	Engineering		1	4	2	2	264429	2/27/12	He was a great guy and very nice but I'd rather have him as a club proctor than a professor. Yes, he wanted us to learn... but he wrote so fast he occasionally had to catch his breath which IMO is too fast, I could never get notes AND understand him at the same time. Material was brutal. Homework REQUIRED office hours almost every week for most.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	264429	3/4/11	Prof. Moon is the best teacher I've ever had. He is crystal clear in his lectures and his homeworks apply directly to the tests. More importantly he bends over backwards to help students anyway he can. I've gotten help on other classes homework from him as well because he is just that smart and can explain it so well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		1	5	5	4	264429	1/27/11	Excellent professor. While his course is very hard his lectures are extremely clear and explanations in office hours always clear up lose ends. The homework can be long but it is relevant and helpful. Tests are open book/note, if you did the homework they will be challenging but nothing you can't handle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		5	5	5	3	264429	10/10/09	The main difference between Moon and god is that God took a rest on the 7th day. Seriously, the best professor I have ever encountered anywhere
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering	534	4	5	5	4	264429	3/3/08	Hands down the best professor at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	264429	5/11/06	Explains the material clearly, gives a lot of notes during each class period, is always available to help with homework, collects homework every friday and is graded by Monday, gives tests every other tuesday and is graded back by the next class period, tests are open book, open notes, the material is difficult but fair, wants students to learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		2	5	4	4	264429	10/21/05	Agree with all above, he is the best and one of the smartest prof in EE dept. He graduated from Berkerly, CA.. His test takes long time to finish even tho there are only 3 questions. But he won't take it from you until you finish it. Tests were open book, notes, hw, Take him if you want to learn and want an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	2	264429	12/5/04	Easily the best EE professor. Knows his stuff and if you put a moderate amount of effort in the class u can get an A while still learning a great deal
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Moon	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	264429	5/16/04	By far one of the best prfessors i have ever encountered.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science	211	1	1	1	4	66035	2/3/11	Worst professor ever. He talks on and on. Most students in his classes can't follow his work. If you thought you were somewhat okay with physics well this man will destroy all interest and hope you have. Good thing he was fired by the RIT administration
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	1	Science		1	3	2	4	66035	1/26/09	Avoid at all costs. This is one of the most horrendous professors at RIT. His tests are way too hard and the way he teaches does not prepare you for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science	211	1	2	1	3	66035	1/31/08	very hard to follow. class is survivable if and only if he decides that enough people are doing poorly for there to be a curve. nice guy great at physics but cant teach. He knows the concepts so well that he doesn't understand how other people can have a hard time. physics background required for you to survive. DO NOT TAKE!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		2	2	1	2	66035	7/26/07	Further confuses students when they ask sinple questions, feels the need to go through the entire process and often is slightly different than how the student tried to do it. Not very understanding if you can't make a class (winter quarter..bad weather and class at 8am..bad mix!)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		3	5	3	3	66035	2/28/07	Nice guy overall, but he is too damn intelligent for any student's knowledge. His lectures are boring, but if you go to office hours, you will know everything for webassign and exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		3	5	3	3	66035	2/23/07	the prof knows his stuff. the first two weeks of school you will have no idea what he is talking about, but he offers extra help during his office hours. if you dont go to his office hours you will fail the test that he gives. his sense of humor is funny and he is always willing to help. the lectures suck, but office hours will be your luck to pass
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		3	5	2	3	66035	2/2/07	Is always willing to help you, but in doing so, he'll confuse you more. He makes analogies for everything even when they don't need them and it is impossible to ask him a Yes or No quesiton!!! His voice pierces your eardrums if you sit in front!!! If you already know some Physics, ignore him and just follow his examples!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science	211	2	1	1	1	66035	10/19/06	worst professor ever. couldnt explain physics if his life depended on it. avoid at ALL cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		3	2	2	2	66035	2/28/06	So Smart but he can't teach at all. Has great difficulty bringing down the concepts to your level. Very nice guy and fun to poke fun at... Also grades on a HUGE curve so it's not TOO hard. He makes fun of you all the time to. Some famous sayings... "That's so sad" "and stuff like that" "persay"...GOOFY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	1	Science		2	3	2	3	66035	11/9/05	Rambles on and grades every little thing wrong that he can find. Will not cut you any slack, although he does know his stuff, ... and stuff. He will get on your nerves by the end of the quarter, and so on and stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science	221	1	1	1	4	66035	2/2/09	I would sooner quit RIT than take another one of his courses. He babbles on and on about the part of the material we understand and he never solves any problems in class with numbers he uses letters to make a long equation and plugs some numbers that he he comes up with in and gets an answer. He completely ignores the math aspect of physics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science	211	2	2	1	3	66035	2/10/08	He's an OK guy, and knows his physics. On the other hand, he can't really teach it well, and its usually very hard to stay focused through 2 straight hours of physics. Anyways, my vote goes for not having him as a professor (and my previous teacher for AP Physics was just as dry, but could at least get some more things across)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		3	2	1	1	66035	11/20/07	He's nice but he can't teach. He rambles and mumbles. Hard to follow, I usual zone out for the entire class and then teach myself the stuff later form the book. Mastering phys will have stuff you havent gone over in class. He wont explain how to do problems that no one gets on the HW. Takes off random pts on assignments but the class is survivable
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		2	2	1	1	66035	4/28/07	Every week he assigns online quizzes on things that have not been taught in class. We do labs on things that are not on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	1	Science		2	3	2	3	66035	2/27/07	he's not too good at teaching. however, he has plenty of office hours when you need help. a fairly nice guy but rambles most of the time. knows his physics, just not too great at teaching it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		3	1	2	1	66035	2/12/07	He's a terrible teacher and can't explain anything for his life...if I didnt have 2 years prior experience in physics I would be lost
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		3	4	3	2	66035	11/17/06	He definitely knows his stuff and after taking the other physics teachers, he is so much better. The curve helps a lot and he is always willing to help you if you need it. Granted, he has a wierd sense of humor but overall he a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		4	5	4	3	66035	9/3/06	Knows his stuff, and the curve is a godsend. He's verbose, but really helpful and cares about how well you do. If you're respectful and make an attempt he'll bend over backwards to make sure that you're prepared and able to get all of the homeworks done. He's worth taking classes with (especially if physics is your thing).
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		2	2	1	4	66035	1/23/06	Cant communicate for his life. If you get stuck with him,do something entertaining with his lectures and count the number of times he says 'and stuff' or 'persay'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		3	4	3	1	66035	11/7/05	guy says "and stuff" like nobody's business other than that kinda right down the midle as far as physics teachers. Not to hard not to easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	2	Science		2	5	2	2	66035	9/24/05	ahhh!! nothing is never perfect...hw are ridiculus....he makes it 10 times harder but his passion for physics amazes you, always willing to help even if he takes his own personal time

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Morabito	2.4	0	Science		2	1	1	NULL	66035	3/31/04	I think this man has made me go from loving physics to hating it. He always has to find something wrong with your work, even if it is perfectly correct (ie if you use calculus instead of algebra). I think highschool physics is more involved.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	1	3	904710	10/18/12	WORST PROF. EVER! She is impossible, does not grade anything until it is to late to withdraw from the class... Expects 8 or more hours of studying a week for just her class and even that won't save you from failing. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	1	Anthropology	101	2	3	2	4	904710	11/28/11	made the quiz way harder than they need to be. is very neat picky about the answers. great person overall but the class is really dry and she needs to loosen up her teaching style a bit. got an A, but had to work by butt off for no reason.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	2	904710	2/2/11	its too bad she doesnt learn from these comments! SStaffshould be considering her removal!She needs to really look @ her students & thrive to do better for them if not herself!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	2	5	904710	12/28/10	It's not that the material was difficult. It was her testing strategies and teaching methods. She took 4 weeks to return our midterm and we are on a ten week quarter system! That is outrageous. She is very full of herself and her lifetime experiences. expects you to put your Job, Life and other classes to the side and devote your time to this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	2	Anthropology		2	4	4	4	904710	11/5/10	Professor Morgan is a good teacher. She grades hard on grammar because you are supposed to know how to write. You're in college. Her classes are interesting and if you work hard you will do well. She does have a tendency to return things late but if that's the worst complaint then she is not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	1	Anthropology		1	3	3	2	904710	10/20/10	This class is definitely not an easy 'A'. She's one of those teachers who tend to think that this is the ONLY class you're taking and ALL your time and effort should be devoted. Truth is, most students take it for the liberal arts credits. The class can be interesting, but rarely. Expect A LOT of outside reading and studying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	2	Anthropology		1	5	4	2	904710	8/20/10	I'm so tired of people bagging on Dr. Morgan. Her class is hard, yeah. Suck it up, you actually learn of TON of super interesting things if you just shut up and pay attention. Shes really chill, I ate and texted in her class all the time. Offer your opinions during class and skim the readings. She's a great teacher. I worked hard and got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		2	1	2	3	904710	1/27/10	All the comments are spot on in this review. Shes a pretty miserable person. Terrible about grading on time and complains about how long it takes. Loves the extreme brown-nosers so if thats you then take the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	2	3	904710	4/15/09	Terrible professor, slow at grading, handed in papers in weeks 2 and 4 didn't get them back until the end of week 8. Obsessive about grammar, will mark off points if you screw it up. Acted like it was a writing class in terms of grammar. Not worth taking her class, wish I had never dropped the anthropology class with Middleton, take him instead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	3	2	2	4	904710	3/1/09	Horribly lazy and late at returning work to students. It's the end of the quarter and I still have no idea on how I'm doing in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	3	4	904710	2/25/12	Hardest teacher in the department. All we do is take notes from the powerpoints. Difficult grader and quite full of herself. All the test and quizzes are open note and open book yet the majority of the class gets bad grades. Hated taking her as a teacher, Never again!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	1	2	2	3	904710	2/9/11	Anthropology would be a great and fun class if I didn't have this teacher. Half the kids in the class dropped out by the 6th week and half of who is left will get a C at best. I have a 3.6 overall GPA but I will just be happy with a C in this class. Avoid her at all costs if possible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	1	Anthropology	101	1	2	3	2	904710	1/26/11	She's rough. I had to drop it. Had the highest grade and it was a C. The tests are impossible and there's not enough time to write the kind of answer she's looking for.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	1	4	904710	11/17/10	Made us study over 100 vocab words for a "quiz" - need I say more?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	1	Anthropology	101	2	3	2	3	904710	10/24/10	awful, this professor was not helpful at all. I worked so hard in this class and only got a B. Her quizzes have no relation to the prescribed readings. She expects all your time and effort to be put into this one class at the expense of the other classes you may be taking RUN AWAY
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	100	4	1	2	3	904710	10/20/10	Worst teacher ever. Is miserable to her students because her life is miserable.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	1	3	904710	2/3/10	Worst. Teacher. Ever. I would have had a 4.0 last quarter, if it were not for her terribly slow grading and ridiculous attention to grammar. RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	2	Anthropology		2	4	5	4	904710	1/21/10	She knows her stuff. Everything is well organized and she makes you learn and talk every class. It was hard, but that's why you're here. You need to be interested in the subject to do well. The Middle East is her area so that class is really good. She grades hard, but fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	2	2	4	904710	3/2/09	Professor Morgan is horrible at returning work. Going into the final we knew about 3 [maybe 4] of our grades. She seems very degrading toward the students most of the time. Her grading is very difficult for this being a liberal arts class. I enjoyed some of the films we saw, but other than that I hated class most days.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	3	904710	11/20/08	Honestly, she is the WORST professor I have ever had. I think RIT should look at all these bad comments and fire her already. It was weeks before we got any of our assignments back, and we went into the final only knowing 3 of our grades. She made an interesting class a nightmare and set everyone up to fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	3	904710	11/14/08	Terrible professor, doesn't care about the students, changed the final exam without telling anyone, and takes FOREVER to grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	4	904710	11/2/08	This professor was the worst professor I have ever had. Not only was her class hard but for most of her lectures she gave in accurate and offensive information. She told our class that ASL was not a language. She is oppressive and a sterotype. I wrote my entire final exam on why ASL IS a Language and I am sure this caused my bad grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	3	1	2	3	904710	10/19/08	I now understand why she is rated so horrible on here. It took her 6 weeks to grade a paper. Every class she would say, "next class I'll return them!" Ridiculous. Her tests are hard... 1 hour to write 3 essays, plus multiple choice questions and short answers. Her lectures are boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	2	3	904710	4/15/08	Straight up Nazi(as said before). Definitely has a god complex with her grammar policy and in class overall. Was interested, now have no reason to ever consider another anthropology class. She single-handily ruined my day when I had her class. Needs to put notes online so you don't sit there trying to copy a power-point. Positives: NOTHING
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	1	904710	2/12/08	Took cultural anthropology with her and it was the hardest class that I ever took at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	1	904710	12/4/07	Never EVER take her cultural anthropology class. She is the hardest grader I've ever had. It was the worst class out of all my years in school (elementary through college). We didn't get anything back on time, and only had about two grades by week 8. Worst teacher ever!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	1	1	1	1	904710	11/14/06	Very hard, even harder then my engineering classes! Worst class yet at RIT! Went to MIT, and believes that RIT=MIT which it doesn't!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	101	1	1	1	1	904710	10/25/06	Very boring, very mean, hard grader. She basically thinks you are taking the class to become an anthropologist and not because you have to for your major. Her opinion on the world is how it is, if you disagree you are wrong. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	4	904710	11/10/08	This class is impossible. Just save yourself the pain and suffering by lighting youself on fire and then drowning yourself in the Genesse River
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	1	3	904710	10/22/08	WORST PROFESSOR EVER! I can not believe she expects students to do their work on time when she can't even grade our assignments. She comes to class every day complaining how much time she spends grading our papers. IF YOU DONT WANT TO GRADE THEM THEN DON'T ASSIGN THEM. She is mean, rude, lazy, and annoying. Don't take her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	1	2	1	2	904710	10/14/08	I was actually interested in cultural anthropology before her class...well, not anymore. It was so difficult!!! She is very intelligent, but never explains anything. Her notes don't include anything beyond basic vocab. so you need to write EVERYTHING down that she says. Her tests are impossible.DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	1	Anthropology		1	1	4	1	904710	3/18/08	Seems to avoid face-to-face time with students who might need it most. I once asked for help after class and she basically said "Ask your friends. I don't remember." Thinks all her students (prior to taking her class) were completely entranced by the subject. Insultingly condescending when it comes to grammar. Ten Thumbs Down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology		1	1	2	1	904710	1/4/08	THIS CLASS SUCKS! It's way too hard and she's out of her mind. Just wait until she explains her policy on grammar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	1	1	1	1	904710	12/3/07	AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Lectures are terribly boring. I took Anthropology with her and she treats her students like they are all trying to become anthropologists, when frankly 95% could care less about the material. Very unorganized; papers we had written in week 2 were not graded until around week 8 or 9. Bad teacher all around, def avoid...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Martha Morgan	1.7	0	Anthropology	210	1	1	1	1	904710	11/1/06	AVOID! Grades unfairly, and as if you were trying to become an anthropologist. First quiz had over 60 vocabulary words to study, and the 20 that were on the quiz were not multiple choice, the students had to define each. Too much work, only take if you are required, and try to get another professor. Class is boring, and way too difficult!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Terence Morrill	3.3	2	Science	736	3	4	3	4	67461	2/17/08	Orgo 2 and Spec ID. Very traditional style, uses board and transparencies. For Orgo: take good notes, see the book. Do practice problems. For Spec ID: Midterm, practice IR! Problems: Use transparencies, and be on-time to class. Go to ALL classes even if you don't present--reflects badly otherwise.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Terence Morrill	3.3	0	Science		3	3	1	3	67461	3/6/06	Assumes you know more then do when he nor the book explains. but the book is still the better teacher.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Terence Morrill	3.3	2	Science		4	5	5	3	67461	2/22/07	Good teacher, but has a hard time relating with the younger crowd. His tests are way easier than they could be, and cares if you understand the subject
Rochester Institute of Technology	Terence Morrill	3.3	0	Science		1	3	1	5	67461	2/2/06	Very nice guy, but class is horribly hard. You either have a 100% in the class or a 50%. He wants orgo to be your life!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Terence Morrill	3.3	0	Science		3	1	1	NULL	67461	2/24/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jackie Mozrall	3.2	0	Engineering		2	1	1	3	52264	11/17/08	She is horrible. She accused me of cheating which i didnt. She also gives labs and most of the time your group is full of idiots. She also doesnt explain the labs at all and the sheets she give dont make sense to anyone but her. She treats you like an idiot when you ask a question. She is horrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jackie Mozrall	3.2	2	Engineering		4	4	4	3	52264	5/9/05	Great teacher, very approachable. Grades fairly and understands problems
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jackie Mozrall	3.2	1	Engineering		3	3	3	NULL	52264	5/14/02	Can be tough, but is also informative sometimes. an okay teacher nothing special
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jackie Mozrall	3.2	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	52264	1/11/06	Lectures are dull, but don't worry -- reading the book is more important to do well on the tests. Jackie always tries to be fair, and is easy to talk to. By the end of the class, you'll be surprised how much information you've picked up without really trying all that hard. This is a mark of a good teacher... or an easy major.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jackie Mozrall	3.2	2	Engineering		3	4	3	NULL	52264	3/8/04	Not too bad of a teacher, sometimes gave out lots of work. Not too hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	481	3	5	5	4	891405	2/15/13	Dr. Mukund is definitely one of the best EE professors I've taken. He obviously knows a lot about electronics based on the way he presents the material. He's very helpful outside of class and answers questions effectively in class. He explains what's going to be on the tests beforehand which makes studying a lot easier.
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	481	5	5	5	4	891405	11/9/11	He was a very good teacher, and if you just redo his homework problems his tests are extremely easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	382	3	4	4	4	891405	11/13/10	He was very helpful, tests weren't easy but he wasn't out to trick you. He grades half for the right formula and the other half is carrying out the math, so if you know V = IR you can do well on his tests. Homework isn't mandatory but i would recommend doing it since he gives quizzes once a week almost verbatim from the HW, and he gives solutions
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	5	5	891405	4/26/10	This professor really knows his stuff and shows it daily deriving everything freehand (notes free). I'm convinced there is no better teacher for electronics at RIT. After learning very little from electronics 1, i made up for it in electronics 2 with his help. Take this professor if you wish to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	481	4	5	5	3	891405	2/27/12	Explains things extremely well in class. If you have a question, just ask and he will go over it until you get it. His quizzes are often based on the exact same problems he gives out for practice, sometimes with changed numbers. He is not the most lenient with partial credit, so just make sure you do the practice problems. I highly recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	482	3	5	5	4	891405	5/26/11	Had him for Electronics I and II and, hands down, he is the best electronics prof at RIT. Teaches the material very well and you will have a SOLID understanding after his classes. Tests can be tricky though so study HARD. Best approach: re-do every example problem he gives in class. Worked well for me!
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	0	Electrical Engineering	451	2	3	1	4	891405	10/29/10	I don't advise taking Mukund, although he is smart. He gives terrible partial credit. I lost ~1 letter grade on a test because I read a given value wrong. I argued these points fiercely but he wouldn't budge. His counter logic made no sense. If you care about learning the subject, take Mukund. Hovewer, if you want your GPA to thrive, STAY AWAY!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	P.R. Mukund	4.4	2	Electrical Engineering	481	3	4	4	4	891405	11/25/09	Prof Mukund is a really cool, easy going guy. Spends a lot of time deriving equations in class, but if he suggests you memorize something, DO IT. Didnt collect assigned hw, once we convinced him to write our hw questions instead of assigning book ones, all our grades improved (he writes his own questions for the test). Very helpful in office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	2	Political Science		5	5	3	4	271405	5/1/12	Good teacher for discussion based classes. Lets students decide what they would like for their heavy grades (tests or papers). Good for small classes where he has the opportunity to talk to individual students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		2	1	1	2	271405	5/12/11	If you enjoy listening to someone talk about themselves for four hours a week, this is the class to take. I've learned no politics. This is a disappointing class with a less than sufficient professor. He's a part time professor now. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		3	1	1	3	271405	11/28/10	Probably the worst professor I've had. His lectures are long and boring don't follow the book. He just rambles on about nothing for the 2 hours. If you read the book, you'll most likely pass. Attendance is not mandatory. I skipped 7 or 8 classes and I still passed. If you're looking to learn about American politics, then do NOT take Prof. Murley.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		5	1	1	1	271405	9/1/09	Not helpful in the slightest. Rambles on about trivial matters for most of class, only to interrupt the 1% of useful information to yell at somebody who's asleep. I stopped showing up for the last 3 weeks and surfed the internet on my laptop throughout class the previous 7 weeks, and still got an A. Keep up with reading assignments and ignore him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science	201	1	1	1	1	271405	10/28/08	Boring and you will learn nothing. The tests are nothing compared to what he discusses in class, avoid him at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science	513	2	2	2	4	271405	2/21/08	He is a very friendly guy, but he tends to become absorbed in current politics. It's very difficult to sift out what will actually be on the test from what is just conversation. The tests only cover perhaps 5% of what was discussed in class the rest of it means you're on your own. I wouldn't recommend him. Not even the notetaker understood him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science	211	3	1	2	1	271405	9/12/07	If you looking for a prof who'll make sense and actually teach something about the subject -- without preconceived notions that contradict each other -- this isn't your man. Note: rambles near constantly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	1	Political Science		1	2	3	3	271405	10/5/05	watch out...he's a tuff one. get ready to claw your way through this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	2	Political Science		4	4	4	5	271405	9/12/05	Friendly and personable guy. Certainly knows his material, however he spends more than half the class discussing current events and is more than content to do so, sometimes forgetting about precious assignments. Read the assigned material, and you'll get what little of the class is left after his current politics rants are done with ease.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	2	Political Science		3	4	4	3	271405	4/24/12	In a small class it is very enjoyable. All discussion based with take home essays for exams. Makes the class very fun
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		2	1	1	1	271405	3/16/11	This professor is so boring that he almost put me to sleep in most of his classes. His tests are based on the book and he tells you that his lectures are not on the tests, but attendance is mandatory anyway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	2	Political Science		4	3	4	1	271405	5/10/10	He gives great lectures but they have nothing to do with what your learning. He'll start off on the right path and then goes off about something epic he did ten years ago - but very nice guy and easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science	211	2	1	2	3	271405	11/10/08	All the teacher does is lecture. He talks all day about current debates and goes on and on about everything. He gives no homework. Your grade is dependent on the midterm and final in which he teaches less than 10% of the content. Would not recommend. His students always get the worse grades compared to other professors of the same subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		3	2	2	1	271405	7/9/08	VERY boring lectures. He is very opinionated about controversial issues and will argue 'til the end. His lectures have very little to do with what's on the tests. BUT the only grades in the class were the midterm and the final and he graded extremely easy. Attend lectures (don't be late!) and read the book and the class is a breeze.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	0	Political Science		2	1	2	1	271405	10/30/07	Absolutely horrid teacher. For one thing this wasn't Con. Law, it was a history of the constitution. If you disagree with his conclusions you will fail. His overall persona and demeanor are obnoxious and arrogant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	1	Political Science	211	3	3	3	2	271405	8/22/07	Really boring lecture. I skipped half and just read the book. The lectures DO help if you take notes, but good luck at not falling asleep. If you are really into Politics this is the class for you. Study before the tests and you still only have about a 50% chance of what he said will be on there actually being on there. Good luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	1	Political Science		3	2	3	3	271405	9/26/05	He knows his stuff. However he calls students "UNEARNED CYNICS" and invalidates their political opinions constantly. He spends a lot of time on subjects and as you can imagine, his classes have some very lively discussions. Prepare for the Early Alert Exam! It's worth 10% of your final grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Murley	2.2	1	Political Science		3	2	3	3	271405	11/29/04	Friendly guy, who knows his stuff, but feels no need to actually deliver the book material. He seems more content to simply discuss politics while you slowly doze off. Doctors could not read his handwriting. Reading the assign book chapters carefully is a MUST for success in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Murray	3.6	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	468878	10/19/06	The coolest guy ever!!! So funny. Let's you retake the SAME test. Need I say more??
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Murray	3.6	2	Communication		3	5	5	4	468878	8/27/05	He is a tough grader but very fair. Explains everything he wants from you and if you mess up on the first one he will work with you to make up your mistakes and be able to fix them for the next round.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Murray	3.6	1	Communication		2	3	2	2	468878	8/31/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeffrey Murray	3.6	0	Communication		1	3	1	5	468878	10/6/04	You have to do a strategic outline with each speech. For the first speech, he doesn't really tell you what he is looking for so you are getting graded on standards you dont know. You basically have to learn what he wants through trial and error.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing	761	2	5	5	5	1330180	3/9/13	One word , AWESOME ! Highly engaging class, best learning environment, extremely helpful and insightful, astute industry observation, practical and contemporary knowledge ! Best professor so far I have had at Saunders !!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing	442	1	5	5	3	1330180	4/29/12	Aweosme, just awesome. SEMA was really the only useful class at saunders. Was sick of writing useless 40-80 page marketing business plans filled with bs for 4 years. I had to take this class for my major and what a difference. Raj is a stand up guy, he practices what he teaches. Take him before he stops teaching the class or leaves RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		2	5	5	1	1330180	11/24/11	I changed my major to marketing after this class. He is possibly the best teacher in my 2 years here. If he teaches it just take it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		1	5	5	3	1330180	5/9/11	Awesome class, Cool professor who crams in so much work during the 10 weeks. 4 assignments 1 video 1 research paper that sucked 1 real client consulting project that rocked and 5 quizzes. No textbook No busy work and you make a website using wordpress. Register for his class today.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	1	Marketing	440	2	2	3	4	1330180	10/21/10	This professor definitely knows his stuff. However, he assigns way too many assignments and projects on top of two big papers/projects and gives you too little time to complete. He also seems to play favorites with students and won't give you the time of day if you're not one of them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		1	5	5	3	1330180	9/22/10	the business school seems to hire the good guys. Intense 10 weeks, expect no life whatsoever during that time, Raj Murthy will work you to death. He is very helpful and very intelligent. Some review lectures were boring but from week 3 class was great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		1	4	4	3	1330180	2/25/10	This is was one tough class and this guy is a tough grader. No textbook even. I know several students who did not do well in my group. I learned many things and I made a website which I liked but way too much work for 4 elective credits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		2	5	5	2	1330180	10/28/09	He is brilliant and changed my interest in internet marketing. I am not a mktg major and dont want to be one but he made me realize the importance of learning business skills. Tough but very fair grader, gives you tons of comments. Very helpful if you go see him. Class needs a research paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		1	5	5	5	1330180	1/30/13	Deserves a 10, engaging and kept me awake the entire quarter in a night class after work. Be prepared to work hard though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing	363	3	5	5	4	1330180	4/27/12	This guy was an amazing teacher. A lot of class discussion and a TON of practical application. Group project was challenging, get yourself a good team and spend time on it. Raj is overall a good guy. Take his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		4	4	4	4	1330180	11/20/11	Marketing 001. Good teacher. Easy if you put in a fair amount of work. Take him he is pretty funny
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing	440	2	5	5	3	1330180	10/28/10	Great professor really knows his stuff. You need to go see him early an often. Tough tough class I almost dropped but stucked it out. You realize a lot of the potential of the information in the class well after the class is over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	1	Marketing		1	3	3	3	1330180	10/1/10	Possibly one of the most work in one class that I've ever taken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		2	5	5	4	1330180	3/12/10	Simply wonderful proffesser. A real exception at RIT. He changes your whole view of business and marketing. I loved this class. Watch out for his strict email policy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		2	5	5	3	1330180	2/7/10	Fantastc prof. Very passionate, just one of the very few classes i took that I can use. No textbook policy is great. Very applied and you need to make your own website. Mandatory attendance sucked but you need to be on top of things for this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raj Murthy	4.5	2	Marketing		3	4	3	3	1330180	10/23/09	He's a good marketing teacher. He has very interesting information, does not bore you with information (he even showed us a powerpoint on "how to make good powerpoints") He knows his technology and brands. His exams aren't too hard, his projects and assignments are reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology	112	5	5	4	5	808776	11/17/08	great professor, very helpful. Recommended. Not a hard grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	2	808776	3/21/08	Professor N'Da is extremely helpful and cares about his students. Class gets somewhat boring when learning about SAP but overall the class is enjoyable. He is very down to earth.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	1	Information Technology		2	2	4	3	808776	3/14/08	Too focus on material but good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	3	808776	3/4/08	Learn on your own basically
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	3	808776	10/12/07	Really hard to understand, many different accents! Not that hard of a grader but class is very boring, he does powerpoints the entire time~
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology		4	5	3	4	808776	10/29/06	He's very helpfull, as long as you show up to class you class and attempt to do well in that class you will. Best teacher i have had so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	5	808776	3/13/06	Very helpful snd always cares about his students and takes their inputs. Answers questions to the best of his ability. i would recomend taking him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	3	808776	2/9/06	Terrible professor. Very unclear, you don't know what this guy is talking about... Avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	4	808776	5/3/08	Very nice professor! Classes were clear and understandable. Also very willing to help outside of class. SAP did get a bit boring, but thats my opinion on technology. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	2	Information Technology		5	3	4	3	808776	3/14/08	take him he gives goo grades
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	1	Information Technology		4	2	4	2	808776	3/14/08	goood professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		3	2	2	2	808776	11/11/07	DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. Took him for Fall 07 BISP; the powerpoint slides will kill you. His comments are extremely vague. The assignments make absolutely no sense.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		3	2	1	2	808776	3/7/07	N'da is very confusing, lectures from power point the entire time. Tests are impossible! Cannot understand a word he says. Avoid his class!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Koffi N'Da	3.0	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	3	808776	2/7/06	straight up french african, cant understand him, does not answer questions, has problems saying 35% of his words, does not teach material, just reads his powerpoint slides, easy to skip class, grades horrible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ruth Naparsteck	4.5	2	History		5	5	4	3	1252489	9/23/09	Lectures are boring, but everything else is EASY. She gives weekly- bi-weekly papers, but if you forget she is always willing to give extra credit. Her Exams are always an EASY take home (Midterm and Final).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	1	Physics		4	3	3	4	1343586	1/28/13	Great if you know physics, not too helpful otherwise
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	2	Physics		2	4	4	5	1343586	4/21/12	He is very smart. A lot of people unfairly think he is a bad prof. He is pretty good, and really knows his stuff. His courses are challenging but rewarding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	5	1343586	2/9/12	Terrible teacher. Smart and kind of funny guy, but he makes the most basic problems impossible. I spent theentirety of the class befuddled and before this I had done very well in high school physics. DO NOT TAKE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		2	2	1	2	1343586	1/31/11	Extremely hard to understand and can't explain himself on your level.Very intelligent but talks in circles.Makes basic physics problems very hard to comprehend and you spend more time going over math instead of physics.When you go for help he just repeats his lecture instead of approaching it in a different way.Best of Luck, I suggest you drop.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	1	Physics		3	4	2	2	1343586	1/28/11	Gives a lot of challenging homework, but it helps prepare you for the tests, which are difficult but not impossible. Willing to explain things if you ask him questions during office hours. A little insane--worth taking his class just for the crazy comments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1343586	5/4/10	worst teacher I have ever had, he never prepared us for our tests and his teaching style was so obscure and difficult to understand that nothing I did helped me prepare myself for his bullcrap tests. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU VALUE YOUR GRADE AND YOUR MIND.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1343586	3/10/10	He seems very intelligent, but he can't teach. Just wish he would've used the book at least once instead of useless worksheets/home-made examples. He is too focused on derivation instead of more plain explanation of the theory! Gives hardly any time to calculate in class. Almost impossible tests. Must agree: Worst teacher at RIT! DO NOT TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1343586	2/9/10	Useless. Do not take. May be really smart but he can't teach. He constantly asks questions that he doesn't know the answer to and then asks the students for the answer. Also his tests are stupid hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	2	Physics	312	3	5	5	5	1343586	1/28/10	Dr. Viv is the best!!!! He clearly knows the subject matter. All the people who wrote on this professor are wrong. Dr. Viv knows the subject matter. The only advice I can give is show up to class and always pay attention. Ask questions if you are having trouble. He is always willing to help a student during his office hours. HE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1343586	1/27/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He is the worst professor I've had at RIT so far. Assumes you know everything and if you ask for help he just brushes you off. Compared to other sections our class average was consistently 10-20 points lower. Admitted he failed teaching us around week 8 but said there was nothing he could do to fix it. AVOID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	2	Physics		2	5	4	5	1343586	6/12/12	Took him for Math Methods 1-3. An incredible teacher. It's really hard, with tons of work (~30hrsHW/wk), and if you're not up to it you will fall behind. But you learn so much, and do so well at it. Absolutely knows his stuff and is focused on knowing where material comes from, not just use this equation. Entertaining. Seek help-best way to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	1	Physics		2	2	3	5	1343586	3/5/12	A very entertaining class indeed. Don't take him if you dont know the material before hand. I would suggest those who do know the material should take him because you get 8 hours of entertainment a week and an easy A. Otherwise, avoid him if you value your grade. fun guy though. really like his purse. :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	2	Physics	312	2	4	4	5	1343586	4/22/11	I have no idea why nobody seems to like him. Fantastic teacher, always helpful and extremely good at physics. His handwriting is impeccable also. Very well organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics	313	1	1	2	1	1343586	1/28/11	Very, very smart man, but awful teacher. He expects everyone to have a basic understanding of the material before taking his class, and will jump directly into the most difficult understanding of the material. I ended up withdrawing, even though I was meeting the class average with a 47%. His humor is awesome though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1343586	5/18/10	This professor is HORRIBLE! He spend his entire lecture on pointless derivations that do nothing to help you. His tests are impossible and unrelated to what you do in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		2	1	1	5	1343586	4/19/10	horrible! Absolutely horrible! worst physics professor at rit! Does not cover material that will be on test and homework. Homework is hell as I teach myself and derive everything on my own because he sucks at teaching. Do not take! He will purposely make it harder than it needs to be. you will regret it so much. DO NOT TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1343586	3/10/10	This lanky guy is pure awesome. Once found him in the fitness center stretching with his belt on the mats in a rainbow shirt. He can't teach but his awkwardness is purely entertaining. First C I've received at RIT. Note: he does not curve or bump you if you're borderline -.-
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics	101	1	1	1	1	1343586	2/9/10	This teacher is terrible. It's really sad to see that RIT can screw up this bad and hire teachers like this. His tests are pretty much impossible. You're only given one hour and he puts at least two hours worth of work on them. He isn't helpful, ever, and he really seems to enjoy making things difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	1343586	1/28/10	This guy is absolutely ridiculous. He teaches nothing and then tells you to disregard everything you have ever known. I dropped the class around week 3 or 4 because I walked into the test A.) knowing I was going to fail and B.) knowing I learned absolutely nothing. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING AND HE WILL FAIL YOU!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	2	2	1343586	1/27/10	The worst professor at RIT. Doesn't teach anything, stands in the front of the room and makes up his own examples that have nothing to do with the homework or test. Don't ever take him. You won't learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		2	1	2	2	1343586	1/25/10	This professor doesn't care about whether or not you understand the material. He just does it on a board, and if you have a question, he'll just walk away from you. Literally. He even put smiley faces on the questions I got *wrong* on the exam. Who does that, seriously???
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics	101	1	1	2	3	1343586	1/6/10	Probably the worst teacher I have ever had. He never went over any of the problems he would assign in class. He would just give you the answer and then give you another problem. If you had a question you had to ask the TA. Really Lazy and just a terrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	2	Physics	313	3	4	4	4	1343586	11/18/09	It's a difficult class. He is a very smart guy. He goes very fast in order to cover the material, but he prepares you well for the tests and final. He likes to throw in some random facts and useless knowledge to keep things interesting. He has a nice sense of humor and likes to wear some interesting shirts sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1343586	1/21/10	The worst professor I've had at RIT. He doesn't prepare you for the tests and he is NOT helpful if you ask him a question. The only high rating on here was done by the professor...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vivek Narayanan	2.0	0	Physics		1	1	2	2	1343586	12/29/09	This teacher is useless. He covers material in class that isn't in the homework or tests. He's really hard to understand and he pretty much refuses to help students. All quarter he made the TA answer any questions. His tests and quiz's are incredibly random and are never on things you've actually spent time on. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fernando Naveda	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	907851	10/25/07	OMG he is awesome. I highly recommend him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nealon	4.2	2	Physical Ed		4	4	3	4	478707	11/18/10	She does actually know some of her stuff. Helped my entire class with Tennis Strokes a lot. Has a tendency to change the rules of a game back and forth in the middle of playing which can be annoying but is also amusing. If you get on her correct side she is a lot of fun. She WILL insist on giving you a hug if you don't run away last class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nealon	4.2	1	Physical Ed		4	3	3	3	478707	11/8/07	Knows her tennis but her teaching techniques can be pretty annoying. She tends to stop the whole class to watch while she corrects one student's mistakes. Despite being a bit obnoxious, if you want to learn tennis, you will definitely learn it with her, and all you have to do is show up to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nealon	4.2	2	Physical Ed		5	5	4	5	478707	10/25/04	She knows her Tennis, a nice lady, but don't take to heart her, "beat you with a racket." All she wants is for you to show up and try to get better, and it makes sence to me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nealon	4.2	2	Physical Ed		3	5	5	4	478707	1/30/09	She does a great job instructing tennis, really makes sure you understand what she wants you to know. Although, sometimes she does get in your face a little and yell...but its because she wants you to excel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nealon	4.2	2	Physical Ed		5	5	5	5	478707	9/11/05	SHE RAWKS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics		3	5	4	1	1412027	11/28/10	OMG! He is a hottie (yes, I'm a chick)! He is extremely helpful. If you're lost or confused, VISIT HIM! His office hours are truly a life saver. Notes are clear and helpful, but his tests can be a little tricky. Labs weren't too bad either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	4	4	5	4	1412027	10/18/10	Dr Nelson is a fairly young professor. His teaching is very direct, concise, and easy to understand. His syllabus and course procession is very consistent. Nice guy, easy to understand. Only drawback is that he's usually quiet and always seems smug. Kind of impatient/rude when it comes to questions. Great overall!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	2	4	4	3	1412027	5/21/10	Decent professor. Fairly engaging (as much as a physics professor can be), young, but seems like he'd rather not be doing intro stuff - my average was an 89.6 and he rounded down to B and not up to A, so, not fond of that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	3	5	5	2	1412027	4/27/10	Nelson is the best physics professor at RIT. His lectures are engaging and easy to understand. Aaand he's great to look at for the 2 hour class :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	4	5	5	4	1412027	3/1/10	Nelson is a really awesome physics teacher. In high school I had a huge problem with the subject because my teacher was horrible at explaining it and had a really bad accent. Nelson made everything clear. Class based mainly on workshops and homework online. Homeworks are annoying, but his class is easily understandable and he's a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	5	4	4	2	1412027	10/29/10	Great physics professor. Lectures were pretty dry but the workshops were very useful. The online work is moderately easy if you pay attention in the workshops (where he pretty much repeats the lecture, and you do an activity based on it). The test material is toward the easy side, and makes sure you get the general concepts. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	1	Physics		4	1	4	2	1412027	9/24/10	Good prof, and probably the best physics teacher. Clear notes and directions in work shops, however I was afraid to ask him questions or for additional help as he tended to be snide and borderline rude with my classmates who were unfortunate enough to have to ask for help. Overall good class and fair grader, but go to the physics tutors for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics		3	5	5	2	1412027	5/10/10	Easily the best physics professor at RIT. You want to take him. Period.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Nelson	4.3	2	Physics	211	4	5	4	5	1412027	3/23/10	Good professor. Young enthusiastic guy, willing to answer questions. Good teaching methods compared to other physics professors. Easy course if you have some background knowledge. Grades exams on a curve. I never read the text, got an A. Not too much homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenny Nelson	4.4	2	Environmental Studies		5	5	5	5	1520045	2/7/13	Awesome dude and better teacher, makes an easy class with simple tests. An easy A if you go to the class and watch the lectures, but isn't necessary. Pretty upset because I think I got a B. Lol
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenny Nelson	4.4	2	Environmental Studies	101	5	5	5	3	1520045	7/9/11	Great class very easy A if you do the work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenny Nelson	4.4	1	Environmental Studies	101	5	3	2	3	1520045	12/28/10	Easy A if you put in the work. The majority of the assignments are common-sense based, or C&P off the powerpoint. He posts the powerpoints online, so you don't need to buy the book. Lots of typos in his assignments to the point where you may not understand a question, so just be careful! Classes are always interesting. Worth getting up for 8am!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenny Nelson	4.4	2	Environmental Studies	508	5	5	5	5	1520045	11/8/12	Easy A once you pay attention and read through the powerpoints. Don't need the textbook. Always gives bonus points on his exams. You'll have group presentation, but it's not too bad. You watch videos, and you usually have to write a 1pg response to them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenny Nelson	4.4	2	Environmental Studies	101	5	4	5	2	1520045	5/12/11	I basically agree with everything from the earlier posts. The guy is really nice, easy, and worth having to get up at 8 am.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Masako Murakami	4.2	2	Japanese		3	3	5	4	1327478	10/27/11	All the Japanese teachers I have had have been fantastic. I would not recommend taking a worse professor in another course just to get a specific Japanese sensei. Compared to the others, Murakami is somewhat more strict, but is no less caring or committed to teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Masako Murakami	4.2	2	Japanese	481	1	5	5	5	1327478	1/28/10	Murakami-sensei is awesome. As far as professors go, she's extremely helpful, cares, will work with you if you miss any material in class, and make sure you understand the nuances of the Japanese language. I've taken her for Beg. Jap I & II, and I love her. She is a hard grader, and don't expect an easy A, but you will learn a TON!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Masako Murakami	4.2	2	Japanese		2	4	4	4	1327478	9/14/09	Took her for Beginning Japanese 3. She was a rather hard grader in terms of speaking daily grades and somewhat of a nazi with grading tests, but was fair, funny, and helpful. I think all the Japanese language department grades strictly, though. I'd recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Masako Murakami	4.2	2	Japanese	482	3	5	4	4	1327478	8/21/10	I had Murakami-sensei for Beginning Japanese III in 20093. She is very fun, caring, accommodating, and helpful. She is a very effective teacher when it comes to learning Japanese and I would recommend her. In fact, I am registered to have her again in 20101 for Intermediate I.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Masako Murakami	4.2	2	Japanese	101	4	3	4	5	1327478	10/28/09	Murakami-sensei was a great professor. I had her for Japanese Beginning I and it was definitely a class worth taking for sure. The japanese dept at RIT has pretty strict grading procedures that carry over for EVERY professor, but Murakami was definitely a fair grader and the class was fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda  Murphy	1.0	0	Business		3	1	1	4	1806693	4/5/13	Reads off of a power point word for word. Would not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Murray	4.5	2	Physical Education		3	5	4	4	1432127	4/13/10	this guy is pretty fun. kinda off the wall, but energetic. while the techno-pop music can feel emasculating, you'll get a great workout.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Myers	5.0	2	Music		4	5	5	3	438049	2/5/13	Very relaxed. Good with pre-exam review.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Myers	5.0	2	Music		2	5	5	5	438049	11/16/05	excellent teacher, great humour, demanding, but explains/teaches everything very clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nair	2.1	0	Engineering	516	2	1	1	4	1342136	4/6/11	Worst professor in the ISE program. Assigns many assignments each week with no information on what he expects, then gives lectures about how nobody is able to complete the assignments correctly. Exam/Quiz questions are extremely nit-picky, he asks questions about minor details from his lectures. Avoid if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nair	2.1	0	Engineering	344	1	1	1	3	1342136	5/12/10	Absolutely the worst professor ever, the whole class is failing or close to it and he acts like he's the best teacher ever. Promotes questions then shoots you down if he thinks the question is 'dumb' or too simple. His tests and quizzes are extremely nit-picky, so unless you memorize the book you're in trouble. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nair	2.1	1	Engineering		1	1	4	3	1342136	2/1/10	I took programming with matlab / c with him. He is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. If you asked him for help he would tell you to look in the book. HE never wanted to help out and his test were really hard. You had weekly projects that were difficult and he would not help with those either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nair	2.1	0	Engineering		1	2	1	3	1342136	1/24/11	Very bad professor. His tests and assignments are unclear. He never gives them back and he give a lot of them. So you have no idea on what you are doing right or wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Nair	2.1	2	Engineering		1	5	4	4	1342136	4/26/10	I took him for C++. I had never programmed before in my life,but I was able to get through the class. If you go to him early in the week after he has assigned a project he is very helpful. He asks questions to make you think and come up with the answer. Quizzes are straight from the text! This class is not at all easy but going to his office helps!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	3	67412	1/22/13	Amazing professor, I failed Discrete I but he taught Discrete II so well that I passed, I plan to take him again for Graph Theory because he teaches that subject really well. He's a fun guy too, he doesn't try to joke around but he is really easygoing. CONS: Cant pronounce any part of his name? :( I just called him Professor all course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	67412	3/17/12	I had Narayan for Discrete Math. Its a hard subject, and I believe he made it as easy as possible. His grading is very fair. His tests are exactly what is covered in the lectures. No surprises. He isn't boring to listen to for 2 hours, and he is nice and approachable. I'm taking him for Discrete II because of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	67412	7/4/11	I don't know how I made it through his class to get an A. His first exam was challenging to the point where I still don't understand some of the material. However, he lit a fire under me wherein I got 100% on all of the following quizzes and 90's on the tests. In short he is challenging but very bright and fun. He is very helpful in office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67412	3/5/10	Amazing professor. He's in it because he enjoys working with undergrads and teaching, and not just for the money. He's amazingly helpful both in and out of class. He tries his best to get students interested in the material. Tests and grading are very fair. Take him if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics	265	3	5	4	1	67412	11/15/08	Good teacher, very clear to understand. The grading is more than fair since you can drop 2 lowest quizzes and your lowest test grade. Just trust me on this next part though: Don't miss a single class, the textbook is useless. I missed 3 classes and wound up with a D and I'll regret missing those classes. Will be signing up again in summer
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	67412	11/7/08	One of the best discrete math professors I had so far; provides multiple variations of a problem so you understand how to solve them and explains each step. Test and quizzes are med-hard difficulty and HWs are on the light side compared to other disc math profs. Also his office hours can be very useful outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics	265	5	5	4	3	67412	10/23/08	Good teacher. Very easy to understand, does a lot of good examples. Easy tests as long as you study your notes. Attendance only required when homework is due and when there is a quiz or test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67412	3/5/07	Took him for Calc B. He was a really nice guy and a good teacher. His tests are fair and not too difficult if you study and understand all the concepts. He usually gives helpful hints as to what questions will be on tests/exams. Do the homework, go to labs, do well on tests. I recommend him. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67412	2/7/07	Good teacher and a nice guy. The lecture is a bit boring, but if you pay attention he makes things very easy to understand. Workshop is pretty easy as well. Definately a good choice for a calculus teacher, I plan on taking him for Calc C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics	265	4	5	4	4	67412	9/20/06	He's a good teacher. Knows a lot about Discrete mathematics and is passionate about teaching it which helps a lot. The subject is not easy to teach. His tests are more difficult than many because he is specific with examples. I found discrete hard, but he taught it well enough for me to get a B and understand it all (sometimes after the test)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	67412	5/9/12	One of this guy's greatest strengths is that he's crystal clear, in both his English and presentation. If something doesn't make sense he's glad to answer your questions. His quizzes and tests are exactly what you cover in class and feel very fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67412	2/27/12	Great Professor. He is extremely smart, and really cares about teaching. His quizzes are easy, but the tests/hwk are challenging. I am taking him for Discrete II next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67412	12/16/10	He is by far the best Discrete professor in the department. It is easy to learn just from the lectures, but he assumes you read the book before doing the homework. In his office hours, he is extremely helpful. I will take him for Graph theory. I really enjoyed the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	67412	10/21/09	Had him for both Discreet 1 and 2. I got an A in both classes. Quiz's every week but they are on topic and stuff you learned in class. Super easy. I actually learned a lot and managed to enjoy myself. I definitely recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67412	11/7/08	Prof. Narayan is the best math teacher I have had at RIT. He provides several examples to make sure you learn the material. He was always available outside of class. If you have the chance, definitely take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	3	4	1	67412	11/4/08	Nice guy overall-- lectures can be a bit boring but he'll do a million examples till you understand. Really big on the "technical" side of math so if you can't do proofs, you're gonna be sunk in his class. Replaces early test grades if you do better on later ones. Moderately easy HW and weekly quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67412	4/14/08	It's hard to find an awesome calc teacher, but this is it. Everything was explained crystal clear, and workshops were challenging but very reasonable. He is VERY helpful. You will have projects (yeah I know, in MATH?) but they are really cool and relate well back to the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	3	4	67412	2/24/07	He talks to the board a lot but his class is generally easy and he is probably one of the nicest professors I have ever had and you can approach him very easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics	274	3	3	4	1	67412	10/26/06	Smart, fair grader, but boring as all heck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	1	67412	11/24/05	heck of a nice guy, but discrete math is retardedly boring, so it made my attitude about him a little negative...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67412	8/30/05	Dr. Narayan was my only reason for staying at RIT as long as I did. He's by far the best person working at rit. I mean that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	1	67412	10/20/04	nice guy but didnt measure up to all the hype.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67412	5/6/04	He's very aproachable and patient as well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67412	2/2/04	Great Teacher... Very Clear and Helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67412	1/8/03	This is a must Have teacher, he's awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren Narayan	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	67412	5/4/05	Really good professor. Not extremely easy, but if you need help, go to office hours, it really helps. Overall great guy, definitely would recommend.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Swami Natarajan	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	389262	7/26/06	Swami was the man. He gave appropriate amounts of work, graded reasonably, and actually cared about the students in his class. I don't know why the department let him take another job elsewhere...he was one of their best professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swami Natarajan	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	4	4	389262	10/21/04	The best SE professor, hands down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swami Natarajan	4.6	2	Engineering		4	4	4	2	389262	8/12/05	Had him for SE too, where he was very helpful and willing to listen to student's suggestions. In Metrics he seemed a little less clear in what he wanted from the class, so the material became more subjective and as such more confusing. He does care about his students though, and will work with you if you need help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Swami Natarajan	4.6	2	Engineering	361	4	5	5	NULL	389262	4/19/04	AWESOME professor! Take him if you can! He actually cares about his students. What a concept!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History		3	2	3	3	14222	10/15/09	Nazzaro is one of the most boring professors ever. His accent does take getting used to, but that's not a real problem. My problems are that he spends more class time talking about prostitutes than the material, and his 200 pages of handouts are in all capital letters, so you need to hold them far away to actually read them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		1	1	1	4	14222	11/12/08	horrible teacher, thick accent,very stuck up, do NOT take this proffessor for modern european history
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History	302	4	4	4	2	14222	3/9/08	Crazy, old, entertaining Italian guy. Likes to use overhead projector. Seems to hate and love RIT at the same time. Test questions come straight from the notes. He also gives at least 30 bonus questions each test. Also, if you have good attendance, he will boost your grade. For example, I had about an 87 after the final and he gave me an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		3	1	1	5	14222	11/16/07	Good GOD! Easily the worst professor I've had. Really hard to hear because of bad accent and he tends to scream into his microphone. Doesnt really teach, just goes off on random tangents, generally about how awful americans are. Loved history before this class and hated it with a passion during it. Seriously run if you get this guy for a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History	302	3	2	3	3	14222	10/30/07	He's a really good professor. Yes he does have an accent. All you have is 3 multiple choice tests. If you can't read 10 chapters then you suck badly. All the notes are on the overhead. Just copy the notes down. Most of the tests is based on the notes off the overhead. Read the book. He gives you extra credit problems on every test and paper. EASY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History		4	3	3	3	14222	2/12/07	I found his class rather boring but, he never assigns homework and it was ridiculously easy. I never got any grade below A+ with only 30 minutes of studying before tests. His tests are only really on People, what they did, dates and books. Each test has 20 bonus questions. I managed to get 110 on the 2 tests and a 90+ on the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		3	1	1	2	14222	11/28/06	Doesn't keep your focus, hard to understand, terribly disorganized, not worth taking any classes with him. Nice old man, but not terribly bright, and pretty belligerent.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		2	2	1	1	14222	2/20/06	He threw a chair against the wall one time. That was unnerving. Had a very hard time understanding what he is saying, he's not very clear in his material. I don't like how he graded his tests especially, if you got 19/20 right you got like 5 points, but if u got 20/20 right u got 10 points. That hurt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		1	1	1	5	14222	1/20/06	Worst teacher ever. If you raise your hand, he will not answer you, he will not answer questions, he is not clear in anything he does, especially his notes. He gets in your face and makes bug eyes at you while going "EHHHHH" because well, thats what he does... As for the 50 bouns points, you only get them if you get every single question right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History		5	4	4	5	14222	9/6/09	This is probably one of the best professors at RIT, he has experience in academics like no other. His voice is not always clear, but its not bad. Explains things well, but it can get a little boring. For students with international worldwide understanding his classes are easy, if not make sure you pay to lectures. And be open minded, it will help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History	443	2	4	5	3	14222	5/5/08	After 3 years of being disappointed by RIT, I am very happy to have found a professor that really makes me want to listen to EVERY WORD he has to say in every class. Dr. Nazzaro has truly stimulated my intellect and has honestly given me a newfound interest in academia that I would've never thought I'd have coming out of highschool. AMAZING.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		1	1	1	1	14222	1/27/08	Oh my god, this professor made me NEVER want to take another History course as long as I live. So boring, his accent is so intense you can't understand him, his lectures make no sense and the book he makes you buy is one that he wrote. I have to give him credit though, only because he gave me a C and I deserved a D. He was adorable though?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History	204	2	2	1	1	14222	11/6/07	VERY hard to decipher the accent. Grade is the average of 3 exams... no padding if you do bad on one. Must teach yourself from the book. Puts lots of notes up that you must copy down, but they are confusing at times too. If you're not passionate about history or bad with accents, find a different professor. Nice guy, but impossible to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History		3	3	3	3	14222	4/1/07	He has a really thick accent that gets in the way of clarity sometimes, but he'll repeat if asked. Grade depends on the average of 3 multiple choice exams. The 1st 50 questions are worth 2 points each and the remaining are bonus. The exams are over 100. Listen for exams reviews because he usually reads from them You have to take crazy notes though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History	302	2	3	3	2	14222	2/7/07	Bit of a boring class and lots of note taking. Hard to understand sometimes because of his thick accent, but overall a very jovial man. One of the harder History classes I've taken. Very tough grader and tests can trip you up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		1	2	1	3	14222	11/19/06	This is quite possibly the worst teacher I have had. I am writing this a year from when I took his course, modern european history. He is funny and entertaining, but besides this he should not be a professor. He strays off topic and gives you 20 pages of useless notes a day. Abrasive, unhelpful, organized in a bad way, and hard to understand.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History		5	4	4	5	14222	2/6/06	Awesome teacher, old crazy italian guy. Makes fun of largely everyone in class. If you know your stuff, his tests are easy. He wrote the textbook, so you can consider him reasonably credible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		1	1	1	3	14222	11/8/05	Nazzaro is crazy... the class is crazy... all you do it take a crap load of notes every day! It is really hard to understand what he is saying sometimes because of his very strong accent. He's a nice man but try to take something else...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		2	2	2	1	14222	11/1/05	Very amusing and tells great stories, but the class is a pain. Very hard to determine what he wants you to know from lectures and readings and what you don't need to know. However, provided you put in insane amounts of study time, the class is doable, but if you can help it, I'd choose another.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History		1	4	4	5	14222	10/24/04	awesome teacher, his class is crazy hard though

Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History		2	3	2	2	14222	10/13/05	Nazzaro is old, and its very obvious while he teaches. He gets of topic very easily and tells lots of stories about his life. Altho his stories are amusing they really have nothing to do with the class. He is very smart and knows history front to back, but rather hard to understand and is kinda spastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	1	History		1	3	3	3	14222	9/1/05	Difficult class: must read book and take notes. Tests deatailed and all multiple choice. Tells great stories, but is difficult to understand. Don't take this class if you plan on slacking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	2	History		2	5	5	5	14222	11/1/04	Yes, the class is hard, but it's a great class and Nazarro is an awesome professor. Unlike a lot of professors, Nazarro is actually an interesting, compelling guy. Go to class, take copious notes and study them, and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pellagrino Nazzaro	2.6	0	History		2	2	1	NULL	14222	5/6/04	Can't understand a damn word he's saying. Gets off topic way too much and just goes through notes without really teaching anything. Tests are pretty easy though be prepared to study everything.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Neely	2.3	0	Business		2	2	2	5	914462	1/31/07	TERRRRRRIBLE. She makes you take quizzes on material discussed in the VERY same class day/time... which means you don't have the time nor chance to ask her for help/questions and think it over to clarify things. You listen to her and watch her show the slides then take the quiz right off the bat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Neely	2.3	0	Business	101	2	1	1	3	914462	10/18/07	She makes you take quizzes on materials taught in class on the same day and time. If you think you can save yourself by studying your textbook prior to class, you're wrong. There is no textbook. Only one of those "excel & access for dummies" kind of manual which you can't even use for quizzes or tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History	302	5	3	5	4	72689	10/29/10	Great professor for Euro. History. He is very knowledgeable about the material and is very enthusiastic about teaching it. Don't bother with the textbook, all of the tests can be aced without it. The 100-question multiple-choice tests are ridiculously easy as long as you take decent notes. Stay awake in the lectures, take notes, and you'll ace it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	1	History	302	1	2	3	1	72689	2/5/09	dont take this class unless you're an excellent note taker and multiple choice test taker
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	1	History		1	2	4	2	72689	11/20/08	Ken Nelson is extremely dry in his lectures. If you study really hard and take a lot of notes, you'll do well. He gives opportunity for extra credit. However, I wouldn't recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	0	History		2	1	3	1	72689	9/19/07	One of the most insane teacher I have ever seen. Lectures are done every single classes. 50 mins exams and 100 choices. At least the test grades are not culimnative. I recommend you to bring 2 notebooks, a lot of paper, 10 pens, 10 pencils, and rope to hang yourself. Book is only a paperweigh, so dont get it unless you want to read it for fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	1	History		2	2	3	1	72689	4/30/07	What some mistake for passion, I take as insanity. This guy gets very into his lectures, generally yelling over most topics. You will not get over an 85 on his tests UNLESS YOU READ THE BOOK. Facts on the test will come exclusively from the book. Take incredible notes, and don't miss a lecture, there is no way to guess your way through his tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	1	History		3	2	4	1	72689	2/5/07	DON'T bother buying the book, it is one of the most dry pieces of historical regurgitation ever. The vast majority of his test material comes from the lecture, which he spends the full 2 hours explaining. 100% of your grade come from his three test...the lowest one counts slightly less than the other two. He explains the material thoroughly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		3	4	5	5	72689	3/3/06	if you take good notes and study them, you are much more likely to do well (u may need 2 learn the style 1st tho). His test ?'s are all multiple choice and the come right out of the lectures and lecture notes. I didnt do to well on the 1st two tests because i figured i knew it all, but did ok on 3rd because i studied more. Overall great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		3	3	4	4	72689	5/20/05	he explains the whole 2 hours of class, in addition u have to read notebook and text book. I never read the text book and pass with a B. If u like multiple choice, this is your guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	1	History		3	3	3	5	72689	3/29/05	Lectures were insanely boring and exaggerated. 100 question test in 1 hour, with a 1 hour lecture afterwards. The tests covered pretty much the whole entire book to detail and 4 weeks worth of notes. Don't plan on having much of a life with this teacher

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		1	5	3	4	72689	2/25/09	Very hard class.I am serious really difficult.Take this class if you have really good knowledge about European History.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History	302	1	5	5	2	72689	2/4/09	The people who keep stating he is insane aren't really paying attention in class. There are 3 100+ question tests where 95% of the questions are based from his lectures. Lectures are brutal though, I went through a whole notebook and like 50 pencils. Overall, he is a nice teacher and does a good job at attempting to make history fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		1	5	5	3	72689	2/7/08	Great lecture teacher. Don't go into one of his classes expected to be able to sleep through class or just walk through power points. His classes are the definition of a college level course. The tests are hard 50 mins for 100 questions, but its worth to note that they are all fact based and require 0 thought. Great presentation. Hard class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	0	History		1	1	3	5	72689	5/15/07	Wow, this guy is insane. Tests are very difficult, concentrating 100% on lectures, the book serves as a paperweight. He uses zero information from it and often makes his test reflect his opinions. And be prepared to know philosophy, geez. Difficult course and long winded teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History	503	5	5	5	5	72689	2/22/07	Awesome professor! His lectures are very interesting and keeps you engaged... take good notes, those are what the tests are based off, but read the book as well - he likes to quote the book for a couple of test questions. Only three tests, not cumulative. Lots of reading, and make sure you attend class but definitely worth it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		4	4	4	3	72689	5/14/06	Dont bother buying the book. Just show up to class and listen to his lectures. He claims 85% of the test problems will be from lectures, which is true. I recommend getting a tape recorder or something to keep notes down while you can sleep. Wonderful teacher, just boring lectures. His grading system is 100% based on tests. No HW, attendance, etc. J
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		4	5	5	1	72689	10/24/05	Great professor, really took the whole 2 hours to clearly explain everything, and in a way you could actually understand. He gives you the answers to all of his (multiple choice!) questions right in his lectures. Just listen and take good notes, and your GOLDEN.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Nelson	3.7	2	History		4	4	4	5	72689	4/23/05	Hes a really cool guy and likes what hes teaching so hes energetic during the lessons. You gotta love those multiple choice tests!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History	462	3	5	5	5	14260	10/10/12	I'm an IT major, after taking his class I decided to minor in American History. He is one of the best professors I've had. He always has a smaller essay for a midterm and a longer one for a final. If you attend class & do the readings they are not that hard since the class is interesting. I've had 4 classes of his. Definitely take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History	101	2	4	5	4	14260	9/5/11	Looking back on my college career he has been one of my favorite professors. He is a very charismatic, intelligent, and fair grading professor. I have alot of respect for him.

He really gets everyone involved in discussions and is very intelligent. He lets you out at least 20 minutes early so not a bad deal either. There is a bit of reading, but if you slack a bit he really does understand. Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History	289	3	5	5	3	14260	5/22/07	Newman is a frustrated opera singer. How do I know this? He sings his lectures. Literally SINGS. Don't get me wrong - he has a great voice, and I never heard anybody rhyme ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY with COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE BLISTERY. Somehow, it works! (And his accompanist is cute!)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		5	5	5	4	14260	10/31/06	very good professor, engaging, makes everything interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		3	5	5	5	14260	8/7/06	amazingly awesome professor.... take all his classes.. he makes you think... he so great
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		3	5	5	4	14260	2/7/06	I loved this man. He def had greta stories and sympathized with art students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History	464	3	3	4	3	14260	5/17/12	Definitely demands quite a bit of his students -- easily 50+ pages of reading per class, on average. Has a certain amount of contempt for tech students, doesn't believe we know how to analyze and communicate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		5	5	4	5	14260	2/2/11	Took Environmental Disasters and Modern America with him; great professor..extremely energetic about his classes and his topics.. just make sure you read his books!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	1	History	305	3	2	3	3	14260	11/18/09	Tends to lecture on in class + he rarely shows a movie. Gives out pop quizzes to make sure you're reading the material. Gives out midterm + final papers as tests. He's a really awesome and energetic guy but not the best professor in the world. I wouldn't take another one of his classes, I felt I walked away with learning nothing new each day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		3	4	4	3	14260	2/11/08	Took him for Modern American History. Really nice professor, very intersting lecturer, but the history was anything but modern. By the end of the quarter we were barely passing the Civil War and then just skipped right to the 1960's. Probably just the class. Huge amounts of reading...100's of pages per night and/or whole books per week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		5	5	5	4	14260	11/16/07	History of great depates...sounds dry...not at all! Best professor I have had yet. Would LOVE to take another class with him. Not much homework, but when you have it, it's valid. No busy work. Go to class. Sometimes he takes attendance. I learned SO much. Any class you can take with him, do it! You won't regret!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History	101	4	5	5	5	14260	8/21/07	best teacher i have had at RIT so far, keeps everyone involved and gets everyone thinking, i look forward to taking another class with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	4	3	14260	2/27/07	Awesome teacher. He definatly makes history interesting again, shows videos a lot but current ones and relates them to history..so no boring B&W videos. Awesoem guy and always willing to help you. Highly Recommended!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		5	5	5	5	14260	10/7/06	He's great and flexible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		3	5	5	5	14260	3/12/06	He teaches at the University at Buffalo (Go Bulls!) as an adjunct professor. All-around great guy, as a future professor, definitely the kind of educator I would like to be someday. Asks you to do work, but grades extremely fair. Gets the entire class involved in discussion. Picks great books as well, makes reading for the course a pleasure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	1	History		4	3	3	1	14260	10/31/05	He's a pretty relaxed teacher. You can get away with missing a lot of his classes. His lectures are good, and at times can be engaging, but not engaging enough to wake anyone up at 8 am. Readings you can get away with not reading...haha. Oh yeah, he lets you out early most of the time, that's a plus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	4	14260	5/29/05	Newman's an awesome teacher, he taught me a lot about our American history. There was a lot of reading, but after completing it all I have learned a great deal more than I would have. All of the readings were out of books, not textbooks, so it was a nice deviation from the normal method of teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	3	14260	11/5/04	he made me want to minor in history. AMAZING!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		3	5	5	NULL	14260	11/15/03	Loved his class and loved learning!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	1	14260	4/27/05	Great teacher. I hate history but enjoyed this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	NULL	14260	8/18/04	He was very clear about what was going on at all times. His lectures kept your attention. There is a good deal of reading to do, but it's good reading. There are a lot of short papers to write, and that is fantastic. Only open essays = great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rich Newman	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	NULL	14260	2/14/03	I took his history class in summer and ENJOYED it! Very down to earth professor.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	0	Art History		2	1	2	1	12518	2/1/12	Cannot express how disappointed I am that RIT has this professor teaching a freshman level course. Heidi is a very intelligent individual and a nice person to be around, but the fact is that she is a terrible teacher. The content that she goes over in class is almost never relevant to her overly extensive exams which are 30% each. Very dissatisfied
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History	101	3	5	5	4	12518	12/6/11	Western Art & Architecture: Tough class, you have to work for your A's but so worth it! Heidi knows SO much and if you care to listen she will tell you all of it. You don't have to show up to class but should because the test are hard. Take lots of notes and you will see the pay off. Shes the BEST Art History teacher at RIT. Take her at least once.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History	226	3	5	5	4	12518	6/2/11	She was a very helpful teacher. I had her for Survey of Western Art & Architecture so all the content was found in the book but coming to class and taking notes helps a lot!! She is great at explaining things and I learned a lot about art history through her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History	101	4	5	5	4	12518	10/2/08	Best professor I've had so far. She knows what she's talking about and is so helpful. She even takes time out of her own weekends to offer a study session, she will answer and clarify any questions you may have (she brings coffee and bagels to the study sessions). But, show up to every class attendance counts. I <3 Heidi!! Take her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		4	5	4	3	12518	3/11/08	She is very helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make you understand something. Very knowlegable in art and seems to enjoy what she does. Exams are not too demanding as long as you do the reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		4	5	5	4	12518	10/22/07	awesome lecturer, but her sweet soothing voice can quickly put you to sleep. still, she is very detailed and knows her stuff well, and her class is relatively easy - i managed to pull through with a B. definitely a good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	5	5	12518	2/1/07	her speaking style is so fast and clear. she is so animated and seems to really enjoy what she is talking about. it truely pulls you in. you have to keep up with the readings if you want to do well on the test, but the majority of her lecture is only losely based on it. I want to take all her classes and will follow her to the ends of the earth!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	5	3	12518	5/29/06	The class is dry but that is just the way it is. If you stay awake then you have it made. She is available for any help you can ever need and is very personable. This class is required for most that take it and take her.. best of all your options
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		1	5	4	5	12518	1/19/06	She is Extremely knowledgeable, and seemed like she cared very much. always willing to help you understand. A lot of reading but most if it was pretty interesting. If you are genuinely interested in art history i would recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	3	4	3	12518	11/8/05	this class is okay.. pretty boring and puts many people to sleep.. requires a good deal of studying but if you make notecards they help a lot... if you meet with her she is very nice and that might be all it takes to get a passing grade...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	1	Art History		3	2	3	3	12518	1/15/12	Lectures all class, pay attention to get notes to study for tests. Also, do the readings, helps to get more info. Study the dates and history of the time period not just the art
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	4	4	5	12518	11/9/11	Heidi was fantastic. She was obviously extremely knowledgable and she kept the class interesting. Take her if you can! She's funny and if you follow along you'll do great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	0	Art History		5	2	1	1	12518	5/16/10	She never gets through designated class content and never ever talks about the assigned readings. She is a very animated individual, and I am never bored in her class, but quite frankly I haven't learned anything. Whatever, she'll give you a B no matter what grades you get in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		4	5	5	5	12518	5/14/08	i <3 heidi. had her all year. she's great, so friendly and helpful. she's learns everyones names in like 2 days...its really weird.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		2	4	5	1	12518	11/16/07	Very clear, easy to hear in lecture hall and understand. Involves class in discussions. Makes Art History not so boring. Read the book and study, tests are multiple choice! Make sure you go to class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	4	3	12518	10/18/07	Best art history teacher ever, hands down. She is passionate about what she teaches, and is very easy to talk to. She will not hesitate to give you help if you just ask!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	4	4	12518	8/18/06	You don't just look at slides, you learn a lot about other cultures' history's too. Even though it was a large class she knew us all by name and even held saturday study sessions before a test. she always brought food and coffee. She answered all questions the best she could, very knowledgable, even researched ?'s she didnt know. great prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		2	4	5	3	12518	5/16/06	This class is hard to pay attention in and the tests are a little difficult, but she is very knowledgable. If you are interested in Art History this is a good class for you. You get extra credit after each final and it really helps. I dont pay attention in class then study hard for 2 or 3 nights and always get a B, Must know Artist names and dates!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	0	Art History		1	2	2	2	12518	12/13/05	Unless you can pay attention to grass growing,you cant pay attention in this class.You do have to show up to class bc its mandatory but there is never any homework. Overall, this is a boring class, but for the average student you can probably pull off a passing grade just by studying 2 or 3 nights with the study guide.AND NO MAKE UP TESTS,dont ask
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	4	4	3	12518	11/1/05	Study time is certainly required, but her lectures are actually interesting. She's very open and willing to help students who ask for help. I would highly recommend her for Art History.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	4	3	12518	3/3/05	If you pay attention during class, her lectures can be quite interesting. Also, if you take good notes during class, you'll be saving yourself a lot of studying time. Her tests aren't hard as long as you study. Very nice and understanding teacher, she's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		2	5	5	3	12518	11/2/04	Excellent Professor! Intelligent and helpful!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		3	5	5	NULL	12518	8/4/01	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	2	Art History		2	5	4	1	12518	1/20/05	hard exams and midterms with a very boring class. but she's a good teacher. i recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Heidi Nickisher	4.1	0	Art History		3	2	2	1	12518	10/20/04	Try counting how many times she says "sorta," "kinda," or "ya know." It's probably the most hellish class I've taken yet...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	4	5	5	3	552838	10/29/12	Great professor! He knows what he's talking about and wants students to learn. If you need help he is very approachable and will actually help. Sadly he is retiring this quarter though,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	552838	2/1/12	Very slow and simple teaching method but very effective at getting the material across. Super nice guy, and always willing to help. Very willing to work things out for missing/late assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	4	3	4	2	552838	11/12/11	Easy class if you have any experience with programming at all. His lectures are fairly dry, but he makes many example programs available for you to work with. Fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	4	5	5	3	552838	11/9/11	Entered intro to programming with very little programming knowledge, and I feel like I have learned a lot. It's an easy class, just stay on top of his projects and you will be fine. He quickly responds to emails and is very helpful. I really enjoyed Niemi's class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	552838	2/14/11	Easy professor. Go to class, pay SOME attention, and there's no reason you shouldn't get an A. Makes himself available outside of office hours if your schedule is crappy, and always answers emails. Makes things very clear very quickly if you have trouble. Good professor. Would take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	217	5	5	5	4	552838	1/28/10	I adore Prof. Niemi. He's pretty entertaining, he explains everything from the ground up, which I really appreciate, having no prior programming background. He does lots of examples, gives you a ton of help, stays after class to help you work out bugs, the whole deal. He's a terrific professor. I only hope I get him again for programming.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology		4	4	4	4	552838	3/9/09	Great Teacher, If you already know most programming concepts it can be kinda boring. Does a pretty good job explaining everything. Projects aren't very difficult, just don't wait to the last minutes. He is always willing to help you or give you advice if you can't figure it out. Don't waste your money on the books you don't ever use them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	210	3	5	4	4	552838	1/27/09	Great professor, I would recommend. Came into his class not knowing any programming and feel a lot better about it now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	1	Information Technology		3	3	2	3	552838	11/8/07	Doesn't know his stuff very well and therefore has trouble answering questions effectively. Is quite strict on grading, but not hard to do well if you invest enough time in his class. You can definitely do worse, but I'd certainly look around before taking another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	101	5	5	4	5	552838	10/29/07	Definately a teacher to take if you can (and for VNSF you have to). Quirky personality, random stories. Goes slow, and is willing to help you during class/lab. Unreliable for open office hours, but thats the only real bad thing I can say about this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	0	Information Technology	360	4	2	1	2	552838	5/23/12	took him for intro to database. Really boring, couldn't pay attention, taught myself what I needed before the exams. Except he removed all content from mycourses prior to the final, so I couldn't study for that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	4	5	4	4	552838	11/15/11	Professor Niemi is a great programming teacher. If you don't have programming experience, then Niemi is your guy. He goes through the material slowly and is always in his office for extra help (Take advantage of it!).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	5	5	5	1	552838	11/10/11	Great professor. Thought I was going to fail C++, as I almost did with Java. However, I have a 98 in the class. Just goes to show how well a professor teaches makes a hell of a difference. He definitely takes the time to make sure you understand things, but you have to get the help! Pay attention + do your work = a good grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology		2	4	4	4	552838	7/23/11	Rayno is a great and quirky guy. Expect to be lost the first 5 weeks if youve never programmed before. All grades are fairly given, an easy A if u do the work (or get help finishing it) Take Rayno!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	210	2	5	5	4	552838	3/3/10	I had this professor for intro and programming with classes, awesome professor. You LEARN so much by the end of the course and he makes programming pretty fun. His hilarity will make you feel all fuzzy and your face will hit the keyboard once or twice. Projects can be a life ruiner, but if your intelligent then your in the clear. TAKE IF YOU CAN!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	461	5	5	5	4	552838	1/26/10	Professor Niemi is an excellent professor who is very helpful and easy to follow. He really wants his students to understand the material and to succeed. Yes, you have to study and do the work, but he is very fair and will work with you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	0	Information Technology	210	1	2	2	2	552838	2/9/09	Stay Away!! Run! Your life will be hell in 210. Projects are blown epically out of proportion as to what we know. Tests are 60% handwritten code, meh. Go sit in a corner and cringe, cuz in 10 weeks, you will want to never program again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	2	Information Technology	208	4	5	4	3	552838	11/27/08	Niemi is a BAMF! He's willing to help with any project you're working on and is easy to understand. Awesome teacher. Highly recommended to anybody that has to take intro to programming
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	1	Information Technology		4	3	3	5	552838	11/5/07	A good guy and a decently helpful teacher. I never had to approach him outside of class for help. Lectures can be boring, but the class isn't hard. Grades programming projects fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	1	Information Technology	220	3	3	3	2	552838	11/16/06	He is a ok professor, helps you when you ask, doesn't grade so hard, doesn't rush through notes. Quirky personality but a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rayno Niemi	4.0	1	Information Technology	220	5	3	3	3	552838	1/11/05	A quirky guy with a strange way of speaking, his class is the easiest programming course one can take. Don't expect his little tangential stories to make any sense though. Don't expect his teaching style to be very good either. Nice guy though. Not the worst class by far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Nordland	4.2	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	873251	1/22/09	She teaches pretty fast, but then again there is a lot of material to cover. Very willing to help you out if you need it. Fair grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Nordland	4.2	2	Engineering	214	5	5	4	5	873251	4/28/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Nordland	4.2	1	Engineering		4	2	4	4	873251	5/15/07	She kind of rushes her classes but it's understandable, there's a lot to know. The midterm was extremely hard and she graded accordingly. I think she's extremely fair, even though the class should probably be more than one semester.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Nutt	2.8	0	Science		2	2	2	2	1132752	8/18/09	He had a good idea of the topic but sometimes he use theories that didnt really relate to the topic being taught. Once you missed a class u were in hell. He used student mistakes to joke from them in front of class. he oftem made u feel like and idiot if u missed tiny detail of definition.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Nutt	2.8	2	Science		1	5	4	5	1132752	12/2/08	You did a great job
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Nutt	2.8	0	Science	215	2	2	2	4	1132752	5/15/09	His teaching methods are often difficult to understand the biology topics. Biology suppose to be fun and understand how living things function, but he made it worse. Those homework assignments that he created are not clarity neither. He talked off the point and wasted students' time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rachel Nystrom	4.5	2	English		3	4	4	4	1278307	11/14/11	Had her for technical writing. She was very straightforward and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rachel Nystrom	4.5	2	English	201	5	5	5	5	1278307	7/25/11	Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design	328	4	1	1	4	685675	10/23/12	Without a doubt the worst teacher I've had from preschool to now. Rarely less than 15 minutes late to class. Doesn't know anything about the material or what she is doing. Shows youtube tutorials as her lectures. Gives vague assignments and doesnt even know when theyre due herself. Not sure what RIT is doing by hiring people like this... AVOID!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		4	1	1	5	685675	5/26/11	Haha, Marianne... Avoid this professor no matter what it takes. Prepare to teach yourself if you have to take her - you will learn nothing unless you do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		3	2	1	4	685675	11/30/09	She is a very nice lady, but teaching is really not meant for someone like her. Her lectures are, in a nutshell, completely worthless. She is all over the place and unorganized and forgets the majority of what she assigns or teaches. I just think she is too busy to be teaching classes on top of everything else she does at RIT. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design	666	5	1	1	3	685675	12/8/08	She is a very nice women, but she is not a good teacher at all, and her lectures are all but useless and pointless. She is not clear on due dates, and does not even understand the computer programs enough to teach us. Her grading is really stict too, if your work does not appeal to her, she will give you a bad grade AVOID HER IF POSSIBLE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		5	1	1	5	685675	11/28/07	Don't take any class with her that involves a computer, she can't teach you things on a computer. She looks up tutorials online and in books and can't even do them herself. Prepare to teach yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		4	1	2	5	685675	1/30/07	She's a very nice woman. But you don't learn very much. She pretty much lets you do whatever, but provides no real instruction.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design	101	3	1	1	4	685675	2/9/12	Avoid at all costs. Teaches nothing but expects a lot. Often says things that are the OPPOSITE of what's accepted in the industry. Means well, but simply shouldn't be teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		4	1	1	3	685675	12/9/09	She is nice, but is very vague with instructions. She contradicts herself and doesn't teach at all. She's horrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		4	1	2	4	685675	2/5/09	Absolutely useless. Can't remember her own assignments half the time, and has almost no knowledge of the programs she teaches. She had us doing vectors in Photoshop, raster illustration in Illustrator, and Flash in After Effects. Her personal workis terrible, and she is incompetent as a teacher. You have to take her, but bit ofadvice; don't listen!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marianne O'Loughlin	1.2	0	Design		4	1	2	2	685675	9/17/08	She's a nice woman but not a good teacher. She is never clear about assignments or due dates and doesn't reply to emails. Her lectures seem like she makes them up as she goes along and she's very unhelpful so you have to teach yourself. Thankfully the assignments aren't hard once you figure out what they are.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine O'Neill	4.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	665853	2/8/07	Elaine is one of the best teachers you will come across at RIT. She is extremely helpful. Not only does she help with your photos she helps with the ideas behind them. If you work hard and are always on time she will love you. If you have a chance to take her class DO It immediately.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine O'Neill	4.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	665853	9/23/05	She is amazing. My fav teacher at RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine O'Neill	4.9	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	665853	8/30/05	Hands down, the best teacher I've had here. Maybe a little easy but for first year photo she was amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine O'Neill	4.9	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	665853	12/12/05	Such a good teacher. Will help anyone. Perfect for Photo 1!

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication	101	4	4	5	5	859117	11/11/12	One of the best profs in the comm dept. He likes to relate things to real life. Straight forward with what he wants. His lectures are so interesting and amusing. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	4	4	859117	9/24/12	Very helpful, interesting class with many activities to show small group communication, not just read about it in a book. Great class and professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication	101	3	5	5	4	859117	4/26/10	Dave is the best! You learn a lot and feel like your teacher wants to know what you think. Lots of great discussions. It isn't "easy", meaning you have to work, but you will get a lot out of any of his classes and be thankful. But in some effort, and you'll get an A. Take any class offered with Neuman!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication		5	5	5	4	859117	3/25/09	I enjoyed Neumann's class. He is funny and nice and makes class enjoyable. I would definitely recommend taking his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	859117	1/28/08	He is the best professor that I have had yet. He was very laid back, but still available for help as needed. Gave us time at the beginning to talk about current topics and later would somehow tie the discussion into the class material. He is extremely friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication	483	5	5	5	5	859117	10/24/06	He is the greatest in his field. Easy to talk to and really helpful. His tests are really easy and informational. Gives the best of what you need of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication	101	5	5	5	3	859117	10/23/12	awesome professor. we played catch for about half of class one day. spent a week playing other games. makes everything interactive and interesting especially since i took the class during the summer <3
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	0	Communication		1	1	1	1	859117	11/27/10	Arrogant. Great professor if you like to hear him talk about himself. No thanks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication	501	4	5	4	4	859117	5/24/09	Great professor. Very down to earth and friendly with all of his students. Unlike some professors, he actually teaches and keeps you interested while doing it. I looked forward to his class every week and will be sure to take another!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication		2	5	5	3	859117	2/18/09	He is a great prof. I love his class, very knowledgeable. Made it fun everyday. Not there to grade, he is there to teach. RIT needs more professors like him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Neumann	4.4	2	Communication		3	4	4	4	859117	10/18/07	He rocks! One of the best communication professor. Personable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	956200	5/3/12	DO NOT TAKE HER. Worst teacher I have had by far. Ever. Her theory is that you learn better if you teach yourself the material rather than her teaching it. I do not pay thousands of dollars so I can go to school and teach myself. She is rude to students and no help at all. Tests are difficult and study guides don't help much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	2	Biology	459	3	3	5	5	956200	5/19/10	Not particularly approachable or friendly, but knows her stuff and can explain it pretty well. Tests are tricky and she is a somewhat tough grader. Overall, I learned a lot from her, but it was an average experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	0	Biology		1	1	2	5	956200	11/12/08	Awful professor, STAY AWAY. She is an overly harsh grader for an Intro Bio Lab. Her lack of comments on labs do not give you any help as to how to do better on the next lab and she is rude. I am glad that she is leaving. She seems bitter to be teaching this level. Her aids are not helpful and her and them aren't clear in their expectations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	1	Biology		2	3	3	3	956200	4/30/07	Dr. Dina Newman taught my Intro Bio I-III labs components. If you have her for lab, PREPARE AHEAD OF TIME before you go. She has quizzes given at the first 5 minutes of the lab which are a decent part of your grade, they are NOT EASY most of the time. Generally nice, but don't be a dumbass. Very harsh lab report grader, get Dr. Wright for the ez A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	2	Biology		5	5	5	5	956200	9/19/10	dr newman is great. shes one of the best professors at rit. she teaches many classes and all of them are great. take her as many times as you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	0	Biology	301	1	1	1	4	956200	10/9/09	Cell Bio - doesn't listen, and because of that, doesn't answer questions or teach effectively. Gets frustrated easily, and visibly. Takes EVERYTHING personally. If you can take a class with another professor, then do so. I love biology, and she made me HATE this class. Audited later with Elizabeth Perry -- AWESOME.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dina Newman	2.6	1	Biology	252	3	3	3	4	956200	8/22/07	Decent teacher. Kind of helpful. Not the best, not the worst.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	2	Design		3	5	2	5	958235	9/2/09	In this class, you come out with a lot of potential portfolio work as long as you put your best in everyone- nice concepts. She has her emotional moments, but as long as you do your work and conversate with her...guaranteed A...B at the least...Dont send emails tho...she'll never respond back in time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	2	Design		3	3	4	2	958235	11/18/08	Though I don't agree that this prof picks favorites, I do think that her behavior was unacceptable. She often came to class angry for apparent personal reasons which affected her class presentation, whether it was shoving furniture around in a huff or being very short and rude to students who requested help. She was also tardy often.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	0	Design		4	2	1	3	958235	4/30/08	It is very difficult to understand the assignments because she is very bad at explaining things. Once you figure out what she wants the assignments are fairly easy and she grades easily. It does seem like she plays favorites with some students(I being one of them) so if you can get on her good side. Her classes are not that difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	1	Design		2	4	2	4	958235	4/27/07	She's big on favorites and pretty tough grading everyone else. However, if you put the effort in, you will get good grades even if she isn't too fond of you. At times, her assignments are hard to understand, but she'll guide you towards the right thing until you get it right. If nothing else, she's at least a very entertaining person; enjoyable. XD
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	0	Design		3	1	1	3	958235	1/31/09	Horrible teacher. Does not explain projects, chooses favorites right away, and is never prepared for classes. Avoid her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	0	Design		3	1	1	1	958235	5/1/08	This woman is crazy. Her assignments make no sense and she rambles on about nothing during class. And plays favorites! If she doesn't like you she won't help you with assignments very much and will grade harshly. If she likes you just show up and do the work and you'll pass. So try to get on her good side early. I learned nothing from her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colleen Ney	2.1	0	Design		3	1	1	3	958235	2/6/08	Awful. Picks favorites and easy grader if she likes you, but good luck understanding anything shes saying. I think she knows what shes talking about, but she cannot teach at ALL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Nickoloff	3.5	0	Marketing		4	2	2	1	892005	11/11/07	I took Leadership with him. Unless you're looking for an easy way out of college, dont take his class. Sure you will get an A, but you will have wasted an enormous amount of tuition money. The only reason he teaches the class is to hire new students for his company. In simple words, you will learn nothing from this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Nickoloff	3.5	2	Marketing	101	4	5	5	5	892005	9/19/06	Best professor ever! Makes the class interesting. Also, he knows everyone invididually.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	1	Imaging Science		5	2	4	2	1161222	1/27/10	I have taken him for several classes and he is amazing. I did some undergrad research with him a few summers ago and I didn't get much help from him when I encountered a problem but every class with him has been a treat, I try to take a class with him every quarter. Definitely take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science		5	5	4	5	1161222	1/28/09	Best teacher ever, if you listen and do the work you'll get a good grade, not hard at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	101	4	5	5	2	1161222	10/21/08	Great guy in and out of the classroom. He is there for you when you need help. He tries to make learning as fun as possible and in college you can't ask for much more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science		3	4	5	4	1161222	10/18/08	I'd be willing to bet the negative comments were from the same person... probably a disgruntled arrogant physics type who got a C... he's a pretty good teacher and his classes are comparatively interesting. Maybe not my favorite ever, but one of the better professors I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	359	2	5	5	2	1161222	10/17/08	Dr. Noel-Storr is a wonderful, insightful and challenging teacher for COLLEGE STUDENTS. His level of interaction is stimulating and thought provoking for those with a post- high school mindset. He is enthusiastic about challenging his students. He DOES NOT hold the hands of the students and allocate "nap" and "coloring" times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	0	Imaging Science		3	1	2	1	1161222	8/6/08	I don't think he's cut out to be a teacher since he can't make up a decent lesson, not to mention he just copy-and-pastes the instructions/grading for each project he's assigned us. I don't think I've learned anything in that class, though I will say it helped me understand my research more,(but only because he made us write about it so many times)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	0	Imaging Science	375	2	1	1	1	1161222	8/5/08	What a dork! This guy has the best British accent, but he's so boring it cancels himself out! He never hangs around for research, and he's assigned the same project six times with just enough difference in it that you have to redo the whole thing every time!! He's also extremely biased on how you treat him. Which is funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	101	4	4	5	3	1161222	2/25/09	I don't know how anyone could not like him. Real good teacher, real cool guy. Definitely take his class if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science		4	5	4	3	1161222	12/16/08	This man is not just smart but he understands more than just his field. He seems to enjoy teaching but likes to force students to come to realizations on there own. I think that makes a better teacher rather than having you regurgitate lectures. Funny accent but you can understand him. I would recommend if you like to class topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	599	2	4	5	5	1161222	10/21/08	Jake was a difficult professor in that he wouldn't give me straight answers for things, but i learned a lot by working through problems by myself with his guidance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	215	3	5	5	5	1161222	10/17/08	Jake is the best professor i have ever had. He has an amazing set of values in edifying his students and making them more intellectual as a whole. Not one minute of is feckless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	2	Imaging Science	217	3	5	5	5	1161222	10/17/08	Jake is very helpful. He is passionate about what he does. He is fun and makes class fun. He is always available for help. Pretty much... Jake is awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jake Noel-Storr	3.8	0	Imaging Science	375	3	1	1	1	1161222	8/5/08	When I wake up in the morning, I DREAD going to this class. I stare at the clock, wondering when it will all end. OMG, he holds us late when we have other plans, really IMPORTANT plans. Another thing, on one of the assignments, me and my lab partner got the same grade. Not so bad, but I had written TWICE as much and it was on topic. AVOID AVOID!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	3	2	2	5	1037287	3/8/13	As said before, if you have prior CS experience this class will probably be easy regardless. However, ANH is not so great of a teacher. He's exceedingly poor at answering questions, and he spends too much time going over some easier things while skipping over more difficult concepts. Take someone else if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	1	Computer Science	241	4	3	2	3	1037287	11/9/11	Pretty difficult for a first time programmer to understand with the way he explains things. Doesn't use enough visual aid (TAs were better in this aspect) instead opting to show everyone the code. Laptops aren't allowed so you can't follow along. Assignments were fair, but take a while for someone who has no prior experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	5	1037287	11/2/11	While the other reviews paint a good picture, here is an actual exchange that does even better: (student asks question),(NH answers vaguely as usual), NH: "Now did that sorta answer your question?", Student: "sorta...?", NH: "mhmmm.....good...",(NH goes on with lecture.) You can watch him spend extra time thinking of a way to deflect your question.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	3	1	2	4	1037287	10/12/11	The man is smart, and easy going on grades (though he can be a big jerk about small things) The only problem is he's downright useless and dodges or deflects every question asked of him. You don't use the textbook, and he wont help you at all. Avoid him if you can, he deserves the grade he has here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	5	1037287	10/5/11	Nunesy doesn't exactly TEACH. If you have some python experience, then you should be good. I had a year's worth, and the class is boring as hell. You won't learn ANYTHING if you don't already know it. Switch out as soon as you can. Seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	1	1	1	5	1037287	4/18/11	Horrible Teacher...Makes up words that don't even exist, such as "scientifisize." Explains concepts in ways that none of the students understand. INCREDIBLY BORING. Not willing to help students when needed, even during one on one conversations. Avoid any class with him at all cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	2	1	1	1	1037287	2/2/11	If you faced with the choice of either not taking a CS course or choosing this guy, I suggest you file for an unmet need and request a different section.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	3	1	1	4	1037287	1/26/11	Avoid at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	241	1	1	1	4	1037287	12/4/10	Avoid him like the plague. He is the worst professor ever. If you have previous experience CS and have him, do a favor to everyone else who doesn't and help them. If you don't have the experience, well prepare to spend all your extra hours with a tutor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		5	3	4	5	1037287	11/5/10	He isn't the best teacher if you are learning stuff for the first time, but if you have a background in CS this class is a breeze. Easy grader, our class average was probably in the high 80's. Doesn't use the book at all, although you are supposed to read from it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		4	3	4	5	1037287	11/10/12	While his answers aren't always the clearest and I don't agree with some of the ways he programs, he's better than some of the reviews here make him seem. If you know how to program don't bother with the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	5	1037287	11/3/11	Not especially challenging, but the lectures are painfully boring. Trying to count the times he says "Insofar as" makes it a little more interesting, but not much. Labs and Homeworks seemed to be graded fairly (by the SLIs) Recitations were more helpful than the lectures themselves
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	3	1037287	11/1/11	Anything he teaches you is the most basic and simplest form you will ever see it. The homework and labs are about 1000 times harder. He is essentially useless. You could learn more from reading Python For Dummies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		3	2	1	5	1037287	10/5/11	He is very confusing and does not explain things. Do not take if you have no programming experience because you will not learn much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		5	3	1	4	1037287	7/4/11	Many will say he is the worst in the department. Sure he is a boring lecturer, but he is very quirky. If you attend SI sessions regularly you WILL get an A in his class! And you will understand the material a lot better. He has very fair exams (that and the lecture are all CS prof's do).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	101	2	2	2	4	1037287	2/16/11	very boring. explains things in strange ways. does know what he is talking about. does not use book at all. goes very little out of the way to help students understand material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	242	1	2	1	3	1037287	2/1/11	Avoid this professor if you can, lectures put you to sleep and unless you already know what he's teaching, you aren't going to learn anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		4	1	2	5	1037287	1/25/11	Awful. Has a mathematical background, and cannot resist explaining simple things in the most overcomplicated ways. Do we really need to bring Set Theory into Dijkstra's Algorithm? Can't explain his way out of a paper bag, so don't bother asking a question. A master at avoiding questions. Doesn't answer email.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	4	1037287	11/6/10	If you have no background in CS do not take him. He teaches you nothing and come like week 6 or 7 you'll be completely lost. If you mess up one test case he destroys your grade despite having done everything else fine. Just plain avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	101	1	1	1	3	1037287	10/9/10	He did not use a textbook. He did not use powerpoints: all of his notes were written on the board. There were no notes on his website. So that means that you must copy EVERYTHING that he writes on the board in your notes. Very boring lecturer. Tests were difficult. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	2	1037287	10/5/10	I hate this guy, the book he has you get teaches you better, seeing as he uses alot of his stuff right from the book. I dont know what others meant by 'helpful' because i asked him about how to start up python at the beginning of the class (first time programming) and instead of just giving me a terminal command he referred me to the tutoring cente
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science	450	1	5	4	4	1037287	7/5/10	He knows what he's talking about and will answer your questions fully. You need to go to class willing and ready to wrap your head around the concepts though, because it is hard to follow if you're not being attentive. He was very helpful during his office hours for answering my questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		3	2	2	4	1037287	10/2/09	He is very good at teaching the topics, but he doesn't use a computer to write code, so he wastes a lot of his lecture time writing on the board. Sort of boring. Lectures never really used. Better than a bad professor, but not as good as most. Doesn't really answer questions, nor does he admit he doesn't know.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science	233	2	1	3	5	1037287	4/21/09	First off, he is a horrible teacher. Lectures are painful, as only a fraction of the content relates to the labs and work. If it's not on his notes, he can't answer your question. His class policies are the worst I've endured, and he grades tests pretty hard. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	3	1037287	12/16/08	You can tell that he is a smart guy, but he has no idea how to teach this class. I have never looked around a room and see more students lost. He is not helpful when you ask him about quiz and test format. Overall, I was looking forward to that class but within a week hated it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	1	Computer Science		2	2	4	5	1037287	9/5/08	I never had a problem staying awake until I went into his class - which usually isn't a problem. Still, he sometimes makes no sense when trying to explain a topic, often has trouble understanding questions, and his tests need to be syntactically EXACT - or he starts dockin points left 'n right - but he barely checks labs/projects...Not bad, per-se
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	1037287	10/11/07	Very thorough when teaching a specific subject and he encourages asking questions. However the responses you get aren't always helpful and often more confusing than anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	1	Computer Science		1	2	4	5	1037287	7/30/10	This guy is dull. I can't speak for CS1-4, he'd probably be good, but for PLC, this guy knows how to suck. Not only did he ramble on during lectures in a monotone voice, he tries to be playful and it comes across as creepy. Also, his tests are pathetic. Avoid this man like the plague. Also, if you try to talk to him, he basically tells you TFB
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	5	1037287	11/2/09	He's extremely knowledgeable, and loves his subject. If you are interested, you'll follow, if you come because you have to, you won't. I have no complaints, and I think a lot of people complain because they expect to be spoon-fed the information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	5	1037287	4/22/09	When I went into this class, I had read here that he wasn't that great and was scared... I came in, and I loved his class! He teaches with coding examples, diagrams, and uses the textbook a lot. I don't know about everyone else, but I felt that this was a good learning experience. Also, if you have problems, he is very helpful via email & office hr
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	4	1037287	2/2/09	This professor is very knowledgeable about the topic but he is not very helpful when it comes to clarification or reasons why certain things are done. Tests are graded hard and some questions are weighted more than others. Don't take his class unless you already know the topic front and back. If at all possible avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	3	1037287	9/5/08	Incredibly boring professor. Reads everything directly from his notes and not very helpful in answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arthur Nunes-Harwitt	2.2	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	5	1037287	6/3/08	I didn't know I could fall asleep during CS until I went to his class. He's extremely boring. Other than that he's a good teacher and he gets the material across. He grades pretty hard on tests and is pretty obsessive compulsive about everything (1/2 absence if you're more than 2 or 3 minutes late) which can get annoying. Decent otherwise..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History	111	1	4	4	5	1043481	11/28/11	Was a good teacher, harsh grader, did care about the students, must attend classes for discussion and have papers done.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History	101	5	5	4	4	1043481	4/21/11	Took him for "History of Las Vegas" class. Awesome guy, very laid back and easy to talk to. Quizzes are easy (they're online and open note) and discussion groups are fun. Assigns 3 papers throughout the course but they're not too hard. Very fair grader. I recommend taking him. He's probably one of the best professors I've had so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History	101	3	5	5	1	1043481	2/18/10	Awesome professor. BRILLIANT guy, very laid-back. He's straightforward on how he grades, and there aren't really any surprises. Classes are interesting, homework is easy. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		2	5	5	5	1043481	4/9/09	I have taken 3 courses with Nystrom. Best prof I have ever had and one of the only reasons I stayed at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		3	4	5	2	1043481	7/9/08	By far, the best teacher I have ever had in my life. He has an extremely good sense of humor and is very intelligent. His lectures about HISTORY are FUN!!! He lectures for 2 hours straight and you never even think about zoning out. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		4	5	5	5	1043481	2/4/08	All I have to say is that if you EVER need some kind of history class...all you need to do is search "Eric Nystrom". He is the professor that makes learning fun! --seriously. He's more concerned with seeing you understand the material than giving you a bad grade; but he will make you do your best!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		5	4	5	4	1043481	10/25/07	One of the most entertaining professors I have ever had. The course itself is extremely laid back workwise and he makes it fun by being down to earth and sarcastic while still maintaining a professional appeal. I consider him more a peer than a professor. If you can get a class with this man, DO IT! You'll actually want to go to his lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	1	History	469	4	3	2	3	1043481	6/2/11	Class: Special Topics Museums and History. I thought the readings he chose were too lengthy and repetitive in content. Each and every class was just a discussion on the readings (done for hw). To me, he didn't sound knowledgeable. I could have said the things he said & I'm not even a history major!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	0	History	101	1	1	2	4	1043481	12/31/10	These comments lie! This guy is stuck up. He assigns only the worst readings, has impossibly high standards, is not very helpful, and loves the sound of his own voice. I keep hearing that he is so great, but my experience has not shown that to be true. He's a big nerd who enjoys his authority too much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		1	5	5	5	1043481	11/18/09	He is the best professor I have had all my academic career. I've learned to enjoy history because of him. He makes an effort to teach with passion. He is always ready to help enthusiastically, but he grades you a bit strictly. Its his unique way of teaching you how look at history with different perspectives that makes you love his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		3	5	5	2	1043481	2/4/09	Great Professor, I really really liked taking his class. If I ever get the chance to again, I will take a history class with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		5	5	5	2	1043481	3/23/08	this is one of the Best professors i have EVER had, if you have the opportunity to take him i highly recommend it because he makes the class a lot of fun and is just a great guy over all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Nystrom	4.3	2	History		5	5	5	5	1043481	11/13/07	A great professor who not only cares about the topic he is teaching, but makes student learning first priority.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O''Keefe	4.5	2	Information Technology	745	4	5	4	4	1698481	1/25/13	A lot of reading :( Show him that you are an 'A' student, and you will get it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	2	Physics	101	5	3	4	4	559093	11/15/07	Good teacher. if you keep up with the labs, and dont just do them to be done, you will get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	0	Physics		3	1	1	4	559093	1/29/06	He was a horrible teacher. Just handed out worksheets and had us do them. He didn't teach any at all. Everything I learned from the class I learned on my own. Find another teacher like Koberlin.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	2	Physics	311	4	4	4	5	559093	2/2/05	Nice, very helpful if you ask. If people do poorly on a test, the next one is easier :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	0	Physics		1	2	2	5	559093	5/15/07	He wasn't very helpful. VEry bad at explaining the material, basically handed out worksheets and graded them. The tests were nothing like either the homework or the in-class work, and although the one TA was beyond phenomenal (thank God) the other basically lurked around and did nothing to contribute. DO NOT GET HIM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	2	Physics		4	4	5	2	559093	3/7/05	Very easy professor, did not make us use any calculus, gave you the workshop anwser if u asked, i got an A and probably diserved a b
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher O'Dea	2.8	0	Physics	311	2	2	1	4	559093	1/21/05	Seems like a nice man, but NOT a very good teacher at all. I had to learn everything on my own since nothing he did was actually teaching. Tests wouldnt be bad if we ever actually learned the things on it... I recommend finding a different teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	101	4	5	5	4	1110135	10/11/12	Awesome guy, good sense of humor! As long as you follow the notes and the textbook you'll have an easy A, but its not a blowoff class- pay attention and study! Tests are multiple choice and short answer, but follow lectures and textbook exclusively. And the BizSim project is really great at experimenting with "real-world" stuff!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	5	5	4	1110135	11/10/11	O'neil is a really smart man. He has plenty of experience and has interest in sharing it with his students. Everything he does helps you learn and gives you hands on experience. Great professor! no complaint.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	5	5	3	1110135	10/26/11	Great teacher really clear, will always help if asked, puts health of students higher than class importance. great adorable guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	5	5	5	1110135	1/4/11	Seriously, one of the best professors I ever had. His presentation is crystal clear so it makes the material easy. He is always straightforward, timely and uses technology well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	5	4	4	1110135	10/28/09	He gives good examples of real life business practices. His tests are not the easiest, but if you study from the book, you're golden. The BizSim game was cool, and a good opportunity to learn. I recommend this dude to all business students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		3	3	4	1	1110135	7/24/09	The class is very boring, he reads word for word from his powerpoint that he doesn't even make. As long as you study the material from the powerpoints really well, you will do well on his test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	111	4	5	5	4	1110135	4/1/09	This guy is a legend, and I am not kidding when I say this. If you are interested in current business news, he is the man to talk. He loves kids who take business seriously, and is willing to help out anyone. I STRONGLY recommend taking him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	250	3	4	4	4	1110135	6/21/08	Great Professor, I would definately take his class again. Just show up listen and read the book. Biz Sim game was fun too, a good way to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	205	4	4	4	3	1110135	5/7/08	Good professor. Can be a little boring at times, but the class overall is easy. 5 quizzes during the quarter, and drops the lowest score. The BIZ SIM game was pretty cool too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	4	4	3	1110135	11/20/11	A very smart man with great experience. Can be a little boring at times since his class is just going over power-point slides. But you do not have to take notes at all because there always up on line. His grade consists of bizsim project and tests. Do good on the tests and you have an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	4	5	5	1110135	11/3/11	professor O'Neil is awesome! he has a lot of outside knowledge and is just an all around great professor. his tests are straight out of the textbook so your grade reflects how well you studied. though he is a hard grader, you will learn very much from O'neil. he likes participation. BuzSim is fun...enjoy that while it lasts!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		3	4	3	4	1110135	4/23/11	Good teacher, clear in his materials and gave plenty of time for assignments. He did not fully explain his grading however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		4	5	4	4	1110135	4/18/10	Professor O'Neil was very helpful all the time. He was more than happy to meet you outside of class at any time. His tests were not too hard and related well to the material that he teaches during class. As long as you pay attention, you'll do fine!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		3	4	4	4	1110135	10/16/09	Great teacher; keeps it interesting by providing interesting real-life examples and can openly discuss any business theme. Very easygoing and truly interested in interacting with the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business		3	3	4	1	1110135	7/24/09	He is extremely boring, reads word for word from his powerpoint that he doesn't even make. As long as you study the material from the powerpoints really well, you will do well on his test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	101	4	3	5	3	1110135	7/9/08	Very nice guy. The material is pretty boring but he gets it across. You will be reading a giant textbook if you take his class and you will attend many boring powerpoint lectures. He loves giving B's so if you're looking for an A, plan on doing some extra work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	250	3	5	5	4	1110135	5/10/08	World of Business class was fun, playing Bizsim game. His quizes are hard and 40% of final grade. But he is very open to discussion if want to contest grade. He is very sociable and not over whelming. He is very fair and a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian O'Neil	4.3	2	Business	220	2	4	4	4	1110135	3/13/08	A ton of reading, the entire 700-page book will be read during the quarter. However, he really encourages participation, he's a great guy, can be boring sometimes, but a good professor wiling to help whenever. Not the easiest professor, but with a little effort an A is definitely possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ari Ogoke	1.4	0	Not Specified		5	1	1	1	54665	1/25/07	sometime i think this prof is a ****....doesnt respect a lot if he thinks you are stupid or "knows it all" student. wants things his own way but doesnt knows the stuff literally. wish that other prof never broke his leg and we wouldnt had to deal with him

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ari Ogoke	1.4	0	Not Specified		2	1	1	1	54665	9/14/05	OMG!!!!!!!!!! He is the worstest teacher in Applied Computer Technology (ACT) major. He had no respect to me and them, also he had very bad attitude...i mean very very awful attitude to me. I wasn't do anything to him. I just ask him very nicely. I noticed that he had no experience teachin that course before and it made us confused worst. Don't take that teacher if he has no experience teaching that course or any course.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tae OH	3.4	2	Networking Security & Systems	817	5	4	4	3	1501654	4/20/12	Took Emerging Networks with him. Hardly any work if any. Most of his courses are 10000ft readings of technologies,so I would avoid it. Exams were OK and grading was easy and he curves by a good deal, so take his courses only if you want a good grade. Good chance you might not end up learning much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tae OH	3.4	2	Networking Security & Systems	817	4	5	4	4	1501654	5/21/11	He's very helpful. The midterm and the final were easy; we were able to use cheat sheet in both of them. His grading is fair. His way of teaching is very interesting and very easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tae OH	3.4	1	Networking Security & Systems	817	3	3	3	5	1501654	11/20/11	Nice guy. Online class was pretty relaxed with a moderate workload. Responsive to emails and was generally very helpful if you had questions. Tests were a bit difficult however and he relies on his students to provide test questions which I find to be a bit odd.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tae OH	3.4	0	Networking Security & Systems	545	3	2	2	5	1501654	2/7/11	Guy has a pretty hard time keeping the attention of the class. He relies on his TA too much for lab assignments and it really seems like he doesn't know what is going on. It also seemed like he had too much on his plate during the quarter and really put our class as his last priority. I would avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	922504	11/14/12	AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. Such a great teacher. She always knows what she's talking about and she was definitely the best math teacher I've ever had. She's definitely difficult and you'll have to work hard in her class to get an A. But as long as you're willing, TAKE HER! Definitely one of those hidden gems of RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	922504	8/1/12	Professor Olles is wonderful. She is passionate about what she teaches and makes sure to explain things in a way that everyone will understand. If people don't understand, she will go through and explain the whole thing again in a different way. She was always a very fair grader and extremely helpful during office hours. Best professor so far!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	922504	5/1/12	She is the most annoying grader ever. Takes off for things as little as forgetting to FULLY show ever single step and computation. Other than that she is OK.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	922504	3/1/12	Calc Foundations 2, have friends in some of her other classes who say she is hard, but in my opinion its her teaching style. She is a little rough and kind of a hard ass, but its for your benefit if you need to go into higher levels of math. She is super helpful as long as you put forth effort and talk to her. Do the homework if you have her!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	922504	10/25/11	Olles is really good at teaching new material in a manner that everyone can understand. If you don't understand the material she is always willing to help you figure it out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	232	5	5	5	4	922504	1/7/11	Took for Calc II for ET and Diff EQ. Best math teacher ever! Breaks everything down so it makes sense. Weekly quizzes help with grading and she drops lowest. Tests aren't too bad if you study and do the hw(which she doesn't collect/grade)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	922504	3/10/10	you are a great teacher. you need to change office hours: it says "winter quarter". This website keeps screwing up on me when I click "rate this professor". I wouldn't continue to use it if I were you. and I fixed the cookies like it told me to, but something else is wrong and it doesn't say, just says "site error".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	1	5	5	3	922504	2/10/10	Prof Olles is the best Calculus teacher at RIT. Her exams are difficult, but only because they truly asses your knowledge. If you want a fun, clear, organized, helpful professor, take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	271	2	5	5	4	922504	12/1/09	she is really clear and really helpful. don't be late and go to office hours and you can easily do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	922504	10/27/09	Very good. doesnt correct the homework however quiz is every week, right off the hw. overall i liked the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	3	4	922504	9/15/12	did't post solutions on mycourses and said that system didn't work .Why cannot send email?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	3	922504	5/7/12	I literally love her, I am in calc b now and i am doing really well, she is a tough grader but she is seriously such a good teacher, if u take her other math classes are gonna be easier. Plus she's really nice to look at it helps you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	922504	4/21/12	I was lucky enough to have her as my Calc A, B, and C professor. Not only does she care about how her students perform, but she really is passionate about them learning and understanding the material. She will push you, but as long as you want to learn, you'll do well. Wish she taught all my math classes. Best math professor I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	922504	11/10/11	She is perhaps that best teacher I've ever had. She seems very uptight and grumpy, but that's just because she's very no-nonsense. She's extraordinarily helpful 1-on-1, and writes everything on the board clearly. She grades tough, but it's only because she wants you prepared. If I can take more classes in the future with her, I will!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	922504	10/16/11	I thought she was a really awesome teacher. She likes to be sarcastic and she pushes you to do your best. She clarified a lot of topics for me that I didn't understand in high school. She's constantly urging us to come to her if we're confused. Overall, I had an awesome experience with Prof. Olles.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	231	5	5	5	4	922504	11/1/10	Great teacher! Helpful, serious about what she does. Very clear with notes and examples, tried to get her for Cal for ET II, but it filled up before I could register!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	922504	3/10/10	you are a great teacher. you need to change office hours: it says "winter quarter".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	922504	2/3/10	Great teacher, tough on grading but you never fall a common core exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	5	3	922504	11/16/09	Just took my final... very tough but I felt like I knew my stuff. She really prepared us for it and proves to be an extremely good professor who cares about her students success!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	922504	10/16/09	Great Professor to have. Excellent Teaching method. Very helpful at all times; she also motivates students to perform well in the class. Prof. Olles is an Excellent professor. I really recommend her for any math courses you take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	922504	10/2/09	Its just so hard to take off your eyes from her ;) Thats the reason I have 100% attendance in her class. Of course, she teaches pretty awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	922504	5/20/09	Professor Olles is a fantastic Teacher. She writes all of her lesson on the bored as she speaks it and really tries to help students get the grade. Nothing hard about the class, uses the same problems throughout tests, quizzes and the final. She is quite beautiful as well. A++++++++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	304	4	5	5	5	922504	4/20/09	Awesome teacher! Excellent Calculus professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	922504	3/9/09	Best Math Professor I have had. Can be intimidating doesnt like people showing up late. If you dont do well in the class its your fault not hers there are is no better prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	5	2	922504	1/18/09	I'm in the middle of a quarter with her for Calc C. She can be a little intimidating at times, but she is a really good person who wants the class to succeed. She is VERY good at explaining material and answering questions, and encourages students to see her for help. Her tests are pretty fair as well, but homework quizzes add a lot of stress.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	3	922504	11/14/08	I thought I was going to hate her class after the first day when she went through all the rules in the syllabus, but she is actually a really cool teacher! She understands us and knows when to break it all down and clarify. I had a lot of fun in her class, never missed one! I also learned a lot more in her class than in any other at the school!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	5	4	922504	7/22/08	Very very good teacher. I would recommend her to anyone needing to take a math class. Even if you don't WANT to learn the material initially, she'll motivate you to care! I have learned more from her than all my other professors combined.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	232	3	5	5	3	922504	5/24/08	This is the best math professor I have ever had. She is extremely thorough during lecture, answers questions, and very clear. She is very passionate about making sure we understand the material. You cannot pass her class unless you do, so she is very good at making sure we all understand so we pass. The only way to fail her class is to not show up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	232	3	5	5	4	922504	3/23/08	I think this professor is great! She assigns A LOT of homework, which sucks, but it also forces you to practice the material and then you understand it more! Plus she goes over a lot of it in class. She answers quetsions clearly and makes sure we are all following her through lectures. Really, very good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	922504	3/3/08	Great professor, obviously very passionate about math and wants her students to appreciate math in all its aspects from its history to understaning the concepts. Make use of office hours with any question you have. Thoroughly enjoyed her class! I actually looked forward to going to class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	3	922504	6/16/09	Tough professor! She knows her stuff, explains it well and has high expectations. You will not COAST through her class you'll have to work. But she'll help you the whole way. Her husband is an engineering prof at RIT so she knows exactly what's expected of us. She won't let you get out of her class passing if you dont know the material well enough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	273	4	4	4	5	922504	4/24/09	I spent most of the time looking at her than concentrating in the class.....but still managed to get a B. Her tests are fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	304	3	4	5	3	922504	3/31/09	Really easy to understand. Teaches fast but thats because it's alot of material for 10 weeks. Always available for extra help. Her tests and quizzes are exact reflections of material covered in class, unlike some math teachers who throw you complete surprise problems. would recommend her to anyone
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	922504	1/26/09	she hot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	922504	11/20/08	She is AWESOME! This course is jam packed with material, but her teaching methods and style are superb. She's pretty nice to look at at 8 in the morning, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	922504	8/7/08	Professor Olles goes out of her way to help all of her students. She is very good at balancing fun and learning. I didn't even realize how much I was learning until the end of each quarter. I had her for 3 quarters in a row and would still be taking her if she taught my next math course. She is by far the best teacher I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	3	922504	6/3/08	I loved this class and I hated math before hand!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	922504	4/29/08	Excellent professor! Couldn't recommend her more. The homework load can be a bit much at times, but in doing it the class becomes easier, you learn A LOT, and you'll get that A for certain (not to mention surpass the other math classes). The class can be fast paced, but you'll be a week ahead of the other classes and will do better on the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	304	3	5	5	3	922504	3/6/08	Great Professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	922504	2/25/08	Great with her office hours. Can help you understand everything even if its something outside of the course's depth she will still go over it with you if thats what you need to succeed Thats how all Calc teachers should roll
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	922504	2/21/08	This professor really knows her stuff. I have tried on muliple occasions to stump and only succeeded once, and it was a brief victory because she came back in about 30 seconds with an answer!! Her notes and explanations are clear. She doesn't want you to limit yourself to solving problems, you need to understand the framework too. Very cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	5	3	922504	2/7/08	Professor Olles is my favorite teacher! Her exams are rough...but if you work hard consistantly throughout the quarter, you will have no excuse not to succeed in her class. She really values her role as teacher and treats us as adults not babies. Live up to her expectations and you'll enjoy her class. Who knew there were beautiful mathematicians???
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	111	3	5	5	4	922504	2/4/08	She is a winner, the best part is that she can be your teacher all the way thought the course sequence, get her if you can. Best math teacher I have ever had!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	4	922504	11/2/07	not clear enough when explaining certain definitions and equations
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	261	4	5	5	4	922504	10/25/07	I am greatful to have such a patient professor for my very first Calculus class. She makes sure that we not only know how to solve problems, but we understand the concepts as well. She has taught most of us the importance of mathematics as a language. Her exams are not easy, but if you take advantage of her willingness to help, you'll do fine!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	204	4	5	5	3	922504	6/14/07	I have only been in her class for two weeks now, but having already attempted (and failed) this course, I feel as though I have a better understanding of the material. She answers all of my questions clearly and doesn't finish her answer until its obvious that I've understood. I am hoping the remainder of the course goes the same way!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	262	4	5	4	4	922504	4/3/07	I personally thought she was a great teacher, I'm dissapointed she doesn't teach more classes at RIT. Like the other poster noted, she can explain complex concepts so we the students can understand them, a handy ability. I also thought her exams her were a bit easy, so just study a little and look at the review sheets and you'll be fine. Take. I wo
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	0	Mathematics	262	1	2	1	1	922504	2/20/07	She ignores questions asked, doesn't stop to explain anything, and moves so quickly that the relevance of everything is unseen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	231	4	5	5	4	922504	1/15/07	Mrs. Olles is amazing in the classroom! She knows the answers to every question any student asks in class. She is extremely smart and well versed in Mathematics, but can teach us at our level of thought. Her side notes/tangents are also great! She shows why AND how, which not many profs do. Take her class. You'll know more about math than ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	272	2	5	5	3	922504	2/8/08	Coming to RIT I expected having Calc with some old man who couldn't speak english and didn't care about his students. I really got a shock when I walked in to see Professor Olles, a mid to low 20's blonde girl right out of college with a masters in math and women's history. She is an amazing professor because she loves what she does, and wants to s
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	922504	2/5/08	She's really good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	922504	12/5/07	She is very helpful. Tests are hard but fair, expect examples from class to be there. If you work you can get the A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	922504	10/29/07	Cool teacher, grading is strict but fair. She will help you with ANY problem you are having. Is recommended that you stop by her office if you are having trouble. Good overall teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	261	3	5	5	5	922504	10/23/07	Mrs Olles is a very good teacher. She makes sure that she gets her point across in more than one way and will break everything down for anyone who asks just so you can understand a problem better. She is very flexible with her office hours and there is no reason why you should be succussful in her class. If you do the work you will get the grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	262	4	5	5	4	922504	5/14/07	She has inspired me to actually enjoy mathematics. I never disliked going to class, I actually looked forward to it. I think anyone who takes her class is lucky to have someone who loves math so much!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	262	4	5	5	4	922504	3/2/07	I would definitly take another class from her. During lectures we saw LOTS of examples. Workshops were interesting as she tried to get us to look at the subject matter from a different perspective, and helped the groups one on one. Exams were a direct reflection of the lectures and workshops. No complaints at all!! Take her class and you'll love he
Rochester Institute of Technology	Deana Olles	4.7	2	Mathematics	262	3	5	5	3	922504	1/18/07	Love her! Our class is not the most mature group of individuals, but she keeps everyone under control and working hard. Her workshops are really fun because she makes us think OUTSIDE the box of what we picture as math. Her exams are tough, but she gives review guides so we can practice before the test, so there's really NO excuse for a bad grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		2	1	1	2	404638	10/18/05	Terrible professor if the material wasn't so easy for me (learned it in HS) I would have failed like half the class already did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		4	1	1	2	404638	7/4/05	Very difficult to listen to - Only class I never went to lecture because I could not stand it. She drones on, slowly, and repeats EVERYTHING 10 times or more. I don't think I learned anything and I know that she even gets herself confused while talking and has to re-explain things she screwed up. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		3	1	1	5	404638	2/17/05	i could barely understand a word she said. labs were disasters, she never knew what she was doing, thank god i had a good TA who basically taught everyone how to do things
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		2	2	1	1	404638	11/2/04	She is the Miss Cleo of physics. She does not teach very well and puts questions on her tests that she maybe explained once before. Her tests are tooo long and her accent is really thick thereby restricting her ability to explain concepts clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		4	2	1	3	404638	7/21/05	She has a thick accent, and is hard to understand. Does not explain topics thoroughly, if not for the TA, I would not have learned a thing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		2	1	1	3	404638	5/3/05	everything already said is completely truefavorite in class moments: 1)she was explaining doppler effect with a beeping football and the ta nailed her in the face. 2) tring to explain an andwer to a "why is this not correct question" Her "its not correct because its not correct"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	404638	11/9/04	Worst teacher ever. If she makes errors in grading, she won't correct them. Questions asked in class are answered with a blank stare.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawretta Ononye	1.3	1	Physics		5	2	3	NULL	404638	5/7/04	Her class is a joke. She doesn't explain things well and her accent is terrible. Expect to learn all of the material by studying the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	67414	1/31/13	PICK ANOTHER SECTION! He is the worst teacher I have ever had. Mumbles, talks to the board, doesn't notice people raising their hands for questions, doesn't go over homework, assigns homework due the same day as a test(what use is it), and worst of all he talks on and on without stating topics so you can't put anything he says into context.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	201	2	3	1	4	67414	2/13/12	He does not use laments terms. Everything he says is in "math speak" which is difficult if you're not used to it. Homework is once a week, and he grades tough without going over it. Exams are easier. Very monotome and boring. I've noticed he's been trying harder to get students more engaged as the quarter has gone on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	205	3	2	2	1	67414	12/1/11	Speaks extremely low and in a monotone voice while facing the board. If you have this teacher I'd suggest sitting at the front of the room and try not to fall asleep. He's not horrible, but doesn't label topics, and he'll just continue to write. I've copied down 4 pages of straight notes before without having a chance to even comment them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	4	5	67414	10/31/11	This guy is my favorite teacher. He can be difficult to understand at times, but he knows the material SO well that it almost doesn't matter. You will learn so much from this wizard that you will reach enlightenment. Long and beneficial homeworks make the tests easy. I loved this guy to death. Very easy to approach. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	2	67414	9/21/11	Seriously not a great teacher. I'm normally pretty decent at discrete math, but now I'm failing. I learn through examples and all he teaches is theory. I tried going through the textbook, but that's about as good as he is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics		5	4	3	5	67414	1/25/11	Great professor. Yep, he's quiet. Listen louder. Very nice, fair grader, understands his subject and teaches it well. Funny at times. If you think his writing is bad, ask him what he wrote. Maybe it'd help him learn to write better...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	3	67414	10/21/10	I've had Orr for Discrete I and now Discrete II. He's relatively easy to understand if you're willing to pay attention. He's allowed laptops for my class this term, but DONT let them distract you if you want to understand the material. If it's difficult to understand him, move closer to the front. I've sat near the front, no problems hearing him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics	365	5	4	3	2	67414	1/31/10	I loved this guy. He doesn't take attendance daily, but when he does it's in the form of a easy quiz or a worksheet given out during the second half of the class, and they aren't always collected. I found the worksheets the most important part of class, as he goes over them right there. He also gives very little homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	3	67414	12/1/09	Orr is a very knowledgeable man but unfortunately loses himself in his lessons, often making mistakes and losing himself in his own work. He is willing to help one on one and can be a bit clearer in those sessions but still can fail to get his point across. He can spend more time on the theory behind something then the other. no partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	67414	1/27/09	Though he seem knowledgeable, I would recommend looking for a different teacher. He's very quiet and is never clear as to where he is in the book or what he's doing in his examples. Pay attention to on-line homework assignments, they come often. Also he's not very helpful one to one... i do not recommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	366	3	1	2	2	67414	2/23/12	He teaches to the room, whether there are students in it or not. With a normally expected amount of effort, you can get a B. Very quiet, very old..sit up front. Not the worst teacher you could possibly have, but if you're the kind of person who needs to talk to the professor one on one, look somewhere else
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics	295	2	4	3	2	67414	12/12/11	Professor Orr is old, no doubt about that. However, he's still a decent professor. To succeed in his class GO TO OFFICE HOURS! He will explain any topic you may be having trouble on, and he'll give you notes to study from. He's not as bad as you may think, and once I figured out his class I easily grabbed an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics	205	4	3	2	3	67414	11/21/11	I had him for Discrete Math for Tech I. He can be very difficult to understand, but he really knows the material very well. If you keep up, study, and occasionally read the text then you will pass. His homeworks are helpful, so do them. Sit near the front so you can hear him. Although he may not communicate the material well, he really knows math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	205	3	2	2	1	67414	10/28/11	Quite quiet, sat in the back so it was hard to hear. Writes pretty bad as well so it was also hard to see. His online notes were much better than his lecture notes, although only looking at one or the other wasn't good enough. The combination was excellent though. Grading was very fair as long as you tried you passed. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	2	67414	5/20/11	He's not that bad. He can go off on some pretty bad tangents. He's a nice guy, just may come off as vindictive. He really wants you to succeed. Easy grader as long as you look like you care. Gave us an extra credit quiz. Just do all the homework thoroughly, put effort into the class, take notes, and he will gladly pass you with flying scores!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	1	67414	10/27/10	discrete math 1 - he is very quiet and goes off on tangents. If you are looking to get a good grade and math isn't your forte, sit in the front. Trust me. He is flexible with office hours and will do homework problems in class if asked. Posts notes and hw to mycourses =) so if you miss a class you'll survive. occasionally hw REQUIRES textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics	366	4	3	2	1	67414	5/14/10	Had him for both Discrete Math 1 and 2 He often speaks facing the white board and is often hard to hear and understand from the middle of the class room. He also has a no laptop policy for his classes. He uses mycourses but he doesn't always put everything up there(especially quizes and worksheets)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics	265	3	4	5	3	67414	1/25/10	I enjoyed this professor a lot. You have to read the book and take good notes in order to follow fully. But when you do, the class is relatively simple. He explains things well if you are willing to connect some of the dots for yourself: which actually helps you in the future. He is not 'orrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	205	3	1	2	3	67414	10/19/09	Tough to read his writing. Difficult to understand his mumbling in class. Doesn't let you know what topic he is covering. Doesn't clearly answer questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	4	67414	1/15/09	I had him for Discrete I, and he pretty much mumbles at the front of the class. His writing is chicken scratch on the board. So basically, you can't hear him and you can't read his writing. Also, he does not use the book at all. His teachings rarely follow the book and he uses old terminology. I suggest taking Discrete I with Narayan instead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	2	67414	10/31/08	When he's teaching, he almost seems flustered or very nervous. Rarely gets his point across nor catches the interest of the class. Tests are ambiguous and he grades them hard. Only take if you're up for a challenge, or really good at Discreet Math!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67414	10/31/07	This man is by far the worst teacher here. It's almost the end of the quarter and I have learned NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA. He mumbles, so you can barely here him, and he can't explain anything for his life. When class begins, he doesn't tell you what he's teaching, he just talks, so you can't put ANYTHING into context. Take Orr, and you WILL fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		4	1	2	3	67414	9/11/07	Earned his nickname of 'Orrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67414	4/27/06	Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! Nearly impossible to understand, over-complicates everything, and asking for clarification only makes the situation worse. Please do yourself a favor and NEVER take his classes!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67414	12/12/05	This guy can't explain anything for the life of him. Very unclear, mumbles a lot and doesn't cover the material very well. His examples are confusing and when I asked for help he was rather vague in what I could do, to do better in the course. Would NOT reccomend taking unless you already know discrete math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	1	Mathematics		3	3	2	4	67414	10/31/05	Nice guy, knows what he's talking about but doesn't explain it very well and its not always in the book and he doesn't follow the book so his examples don't resemble anything you can reference later, definately mumbles and difficult to pay attention to
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	67414	10/20/05	Stereotypical absent-minded mumbling math professor... He really doesn't explain what he's doing on the board. When he does, he mumbles so that you can't really hear him. No clue what is going on in the class. Very easy on the grading, tho the tests are very difficult. (I deserve a 60 but got 84)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	67414	11/21/04	This guy is THE MAN. He is so damn smart I bet he could beat Stephen Hawkings at chess or something with his eyes closed. Anyone who disagrees has no idea how awesome this guy is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	NULL	67414	2/19/03	no corrections on homeworks
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics	205	3	5	5	NULL	67414	10/23/02	This guy is the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67414	11/2/07	Professor Orr actually is a very good professor. He may speak at a low volume at times, but just sit near the front. If you pay attention (copy what he writes on the board) and do the homework then you'll get an easy A and you will learn the material as an added bonus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	265	3	1	1	1	67414	10/27/07	The class could be empty and he would still teach the same. He teaches without knowing how his students and what they need to spend more time on. He knows his material, but he doesn't know how to teach it. Nice guy, bad teacher. Haven't completed the class yet so no clue on grading, but 45% of my grade is based on the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	1	67414	2/14/07	Unless you are telepathic, stay away from professor Orr. He mumbles to a point where I can't understand him at all. Not only does he mumble, his hand writing can be consider as abstract art. His notes doesn't help too. Its sometimes handwritten and when typed, it doesn't make sense at all. Also he can't make up an good example to save his life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67414	2/14/06	one word, IMPOSSIBLE! this guy is hard to understand and to follow cuz his examples are ummm CONFUSING! screw him and dont take him unless you really really really really have to
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	4	67414	11/13/05	He definitely mumbled a lot. You can't hear what he is saying and the times you hear what he's saying, you have no idea what he's talking about. The accompanying text is equally bad. Discrete Math is interesting but this course ruined it for me. Don't take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	4	67414	10/25/05	Mumbles a LOT. One of those professors with a barely-there teaching style... you really have to struggle to pay attention in class sometimes because he's so quiet and mumbles so much. Doesn't really explain what he's doing a lot of the time and is NOT very approachable about homework, etc. Fairly easy grading, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	67414	1/31/05	Professor Orr was NOT good at explaining material... Nor was he approachable when one had a question about the homework. I would not recommend taking him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Orr	2.4	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	NULL	67414	2/3/04	made no attempts to explain what the hell he was doing, at any time.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Virginia Orzel	2.8	2	Film		3	5	2	2	685681	2/20/06	She constantly paces around the room, says um alot, and teaches the material poorly IMO. She is however very helpful if you ask for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Virginia Orzel	2.8	0	Film		2	3	1	4	685681	11/11/05	She expects you to know a lot more than you do - especially if your a non-major. Expect to spend 40+ hours on projects to barely meet her expectations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	1	Biology		2	2	3	3	1190913	2/16/12	Explains things reasonably well. Very inconsistent grader. Evaluates more on rote memorization than on critical analysis. Expects specific answers to vague or ambiguous questions. His lectures do not convey his passion for the subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology	759	1	2	2	4	1190913	5/5/11	This class is a graduate level, but it's horrible. 2 exams, really hard & hard quizzes. A lot of work and he is MEAN and doesn't understand how to be human (being 1 min late to class hurts your grade). He thinks we learn by getting C's on exams and quizzes. Do yourself a favor and find a better elective.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	2	Biology		5	4	5	4	1190913	4/5/11	This class was a blow off!!! Just go to class, do your homework, WHICH ARE THE EASIEST ASSIGNMENTS OF YOUR LIFE!!!, and GET A STINKIN' A!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology		2	1	2	4	1190913	1/27/11	Horrible teacher! DO NOT TAKE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology		3	2	1	1	1190913	2/18/09	Worst Teacher ever. Tries to find stupid places to take off points for assignments. Doesn't know what he's talking about and doesn't answer any questions you ask him. Avoid him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology	759	2	1	2	4	1190913	10/24/08	Ugh. One of the worst teachers here. Doesn't really know what he is talking about so has the students "teach" by doing 2 presentations daily on papers from like 10 years ago on lame diseases. Not what I expected at all. Very disappointed. Very insecure guy, and really awkward. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	2	Biology	421	3	5	5	4	1190913	2/9/12	Had him for Genetics and Biocomp. I would say "tough but fair", when you lose points you know exactly why. Extremely organized and scheduled, no random due dates or confusing slides, etc. Usually gives weekly quizzes, but this is good b/c it allows you to make your mistakes on small grades and learn from them, then you can do well on the exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology		2	1	1	1	1190913	5/1/11	Terrible lab professor (Gen Bio Lab III). Really doesn't do anything. Doesn't bother to teach the lab ahead of time like he supposed to. Will argue with you over pointless facts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology		2	1	1	3	1190913	1/27/11	Just may be the most incompetent professor in COS...just needs to stay in the lab and not interact with first year kids. If you can avoid him, do it. Change your schedule. Change your major. At all costs, avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology	206	3	1	1	3	1190913	1/23/11	Only take class with him if you are already good in Bio, he doesn't give much on an explanation about the labs, just reminds you when the reports do and says go.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Osier	2.1	0	Biology		4	1	2	1	1190913	11/25/08	Just go to class...get bored...do the hw...pretty much...get out alive!! AVOID!! AVOID!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology	452	2	5	5	4	1625524	2/28/13	He is perhaps the best professor in sociology department. He enjoys what he teaches and cares much about his students. He is young and very cool guy. If you want to have an easy and friendly professor, take his class!! Lecture are a bit long and there is a large reading, nevertheless, he makes class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology	210	5	5	4	3	1625524	11/27/12	He is a really cool guy who really just cares about what he is teaching, not little details when it comes to grades. He is very enthusiastic about what he lectures. As much as I enjoyed the class, there is a good chance you will find yourself asleep a day or two. Good chance for a good grade however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	1	Sociology	210	4	4	2	3	1625524	2/29/12	nice guy. Encourages students to attend lectures but not required. Plenty of options to make up bad grades. Fairly easy also though one essay i got an A on and his comments were "answers are a bit thin, expand them to improve your grade" so he's a bit unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology	515	5	5	2	1	1625524	12/24/11	One of the youngest professors, he's really good BUT he loves to talk too much! He just follows the notes instead of using his OWN words! Well he's smart! He makes this class easy! No finals, tests and quizzes. If you look for an easy prof..then take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology	210	5	5	5	2	1625524	10/11/11	I am an engineering student who was forced to take sociology, but I loved his class! GET HIM IF YOU CAN!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology		5	5	5	3	1625524	2/16/13	He was a really cool guy who tried to make lectures more like discussions. He was enthusiastic about the topic and a really great professor. Grading was easy as long as you paid a little attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	1	Sociology		5	3	3	1	1625524	3/1/12	Easy going professor, teaches the class easily, few essays, lots of bonus chances, and non-mandatory attendence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	1	Sociology	515	4	3	2	4	1625524	1/12/12	As a Sociology major I had a hard time in his class. The work is easy but it feels just like busy work. It's easy to zone out in his class. When he lectures or explains something he just sits in a chair motionless and monotone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Overfelt	4.1	2	Sociology	210	5	5	5	5	1625524	11/17/11	Awesome professor. He'll give weekly readings, two papers for the whole term and one of them is a group presentation that counts as the final which is awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	301	3	5	5	4	903669	11/29/12	US Professor of the Year! Woohoo!! He deserves it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	313	2	5	5	5	903669	5/31/12	He is just a wonderful professor. He makes class time fun and is very funny. He is so busy but always makes time for his students and helps them to get co-ops and jobs after they graduate. If you ever have the chance you should definitely take one of his classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	301	3	5	5	5	903669	11/21/11	Great professor, very knowledgeable, brilliant, funny, flexible. But most importantly he is caring. Attending his class is informative and FUN.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	303	3	5	5	5	903669	6/8/11	Great teacher. You get so much from his teaching. He knows his stuff and is funny and nice too.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	301	1	5	5	3	903669	11/25/10	Dr. Pagano is a great teacher. He really knows what he is talking about. He is hilarious and makes you want to attend class. He is even willing to make a fool of himself to get students to learn. Among best teachers I ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	201	2	5	5	4	903669	11/27/09	Great teacher!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	303	2	5	5	5	903669	5/31/12	I was lucky to have him for two classes this quarter! See my evaluation of him below for the other class. He is the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	200	5	5	5	5	903669	11/29/11	He is my all time favorite professor.I really hope I can take another course from him in the future, but I cannot this year :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	313	2	5	5	3	903669	6/8/11	Great professor. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	302	3	5	5	5	903669	3/11/11	he loves to teach and it shows! you won't find a better prof anywhere.

His classes are fun and it doesn't feel like wore at all...because he makes it fun. He works too much though and needs to get out and enjoy life!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	1	Science Technology & Society	200	5	2	4	4	903669	5/15/09	He is funny teacher. His way of teaching is very flexible, but I wish he could explains the depth of science topics. He doesn't challenge students enough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	200	3	5	5	4	903669	11/14/08	awesome teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Todd Pagano	4.9	2	Science Technology & Society	301	3	5	5	4	903669	12/31/07	Absolute caring professor. Funny and fun to look at!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Oscar Palacio	2.7	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	5	1370387	1/26/13	Great teacher, VERY fine art. Once you get to know him he is great and can really know what he is talking about. Don't take him lightly and become close with him: you won't regret it, especially if you are Fine Art Photo.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oscar Palacio	2.7	0	Fine Arts		4	1	2	1	1370387	4/12/11	It's very hard to please him. Gives better grade to photos that had little work while gives bad grade to a picture you make effort on. Makes no sense at all. He also plays favoritism and limits our creativity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oscar Palacio	2.7	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	4	1370387	4/9/10	This professor is nothing but a headache. Hard to understand, and seems to like failing students. Unwilling to compromise and finds ways to drop your grade for no reason.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oscar Palacio	2.7	2	Fine Arts	417	3	5	5	5	1370387	1/18/12	Once you get used to his accent, he's the best professor anyone could ask for. He's always willing to offer advice to students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oscar Palacio	2.7	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	3	1370387	10/27/10	He seems not to care much for teaching. He is lazy and misses every class he can. During presentations he interrupts just to argue. His points are never valid or make sense, he just seems to like to embarrass people. For photography assignments, he never explains why you received the grade, just gives a percent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	4	5	3	245423	2/25/13	As long as you do all of the work it's an easy A and you still learn how to do the actual math. She gives out quite a few bonus points compared to other profs. Makes math somewhat interesting and doesn't make me want to go to sleep, plus she's very nice too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	2	245423	11/13/12	She's a sweet lady. Go to class , pay attention, and do what she says. It's not a difficult class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	3	245423	5/17/12	Much better than my professor for Discrete I, she taught Discrete II in an understandable way. Assignments were easy (because I knew what to do, not because it's a blow-off).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	2	245423	2/27/12	Easiest Math teacher. She teaches the material clearly. She teaches you stuff by showing ALOT of examples and if you attend every class leading up to a unit exam OR the final, she gives you 5 extra points on that exam! She also lets you know exactly whats going to be on each exam, and practically gave us the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	2	245423	2/2/12	Notes all week, then quiz/unit exam on Fridays
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	1	245423	11/9/11	Awesome professor. Tells you exactly what will be on exams. Understands how to teach math. Does a lot of repetition. But if you don't go to class every day without telling her, she'll get mad at you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	2	245423	11/7/11	Possibly the best -teacher- I have ever had. I could sit in class, write some general notes, and I -learned-. Maybe it's her simplistic approach but it is extremely easy to learn from her. Do everything in your power to take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	4	245423	10/18/11	Incredible professor. Taught well while only assigning 10-15 minutes of homework per week. Quiz weekly can be taken in any of her discrete 205 sections, and she doesn't make you come in on Fridays if you take the quiz on Thursday. Exam rather than quiz every three weeks. Attendance encouraged with bonus points on exams for perfect record.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	3	245423	3/7/11	Listen to what others have said. You want this teacher if you can get her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	245423	1/26/11	Very easy teacher. She will keep you focused during the class, and is very upfront about homework assignments to do. Quizzes are short and simple. Teaches very clearly and knows the subject having taught it for a number of years. Get this teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	2	245423	11/26/12	She gives a lot of bonus points if you always go to class. Just pay attention, do the homework (it's a 100 if it's complete) and you'll be hard-pressed not to get an A (and have actually learned something).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	245423	10/24/12	she is pretty good at teaching. its easy material just try to stay on topic and youll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	4/30/12	Discrete Math 1 @RIT she is one of the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	4	5	3	245423	2/24/12	0-10 minutes of homework every week. Bonus points on exams (including final) for attendance. Does not take crap, but is an excellent teacher who really knows her stuff. Cares about field. Great for Discrete I and II.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	11/29/11	Professor Oehlbeck is an excellent professor. She utilizes mycourses well, teaches in an easily understood fashion, and does not require attendance everyday to pass (only quiz/test days). If she is an instructor for a class you need, try getting her classes before anyone else in the department. VERY GOOD AT TEACHING!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	4	4	4	5	245423	11/7/11	Fantastic teacher, just like everyone says. I loved her for Discreet 1, am siggned up for 2 with her as well. Bonus points (5) on the tests just for showing up for class. Pay attention & don't screw around, because she will jump on you for that. She has fine tuned the course and her teaching methods to make the course as easy as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	245423	10/25/11	An amazing math teacher. Im normally a B-C math student and I got a 98 in her class. Very nice and lets you take the quiz early. HIGHLY suggested :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	4	4	5	2	245423	7/13/11	Really good teacher. There are tons of opportunities for extra credit and she always explains everything very clearly. Definitely take a class with her if you need math credits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	245423	2/14/11	Makes the class extremely easy, and semi-entertaining. Without her, I imagine the material would be very boring. Easy to understand, very forgiving grader, and works around your schedule. DEFINITELY take her for any class she has!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	3	245423	11/16/10	Extremely easy professor! Always willing to meet after class to answer questions, and willing to work around a student's schedule for tests. She doesn't care WHAT section of a certain class you attend, so long as you attend the class, so if you miss your 8am with her, you can come in later that day to another one of her classes. Fairly easy grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	4	4	245423	10/26/10	Could not possibly be nicer. She is very nice, but at the same time isn't a pushover, which is hard to achieve as a professor. It's hard to tell whether her tests are easy or she teaches very well because I have no real frame of reference, but I know I learned a hell of a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	245423	4/14/10	Awesome teacher. Helpful, nice, understanding, fun, wants you to learn, and all around awesome. Easy A with little work. Take this teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	2	245423	3/1/10	She's definitely one of my most favorite teachers of my entire life. She makes the class easy to understand and fun to attend. She teaches the subject well and likes to get her students involved. Definitely take her class if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	3	245423	2/10/10	One of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She really knows what she is teaching, and really loves teaching it. Super easy class, as long as you attend class and take notes, you'll get an A! :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	245423	11/24/09	Nice, helpful, extremely fair. Practically handed us the final on a silver platter. Very little homework. Has a bad habit of teaching things the day before the exam. All notes available online. Will take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	10/26/09	She's nice. Give you points for showing up. Straight-forward. Easy to understand. Only gets angry if you do something like watch football games on your laptop like the **** in my class. She also gets mad if you don't show up to class and don't do homework because she makes an effort to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	5/11/09	Great teacher, easy class low amounts of homework. Bonus points for showing up. weekly tests take 5min. take her if you can get her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	245423	5/21/08	I LOVE CAROL. She is the best teacher I've ever had. Goes wayyyy out of her way to make sure that students understand the material. Also tells great stories. Bonus points for little things are often handed out, and it makes the class that much more enjoyable. Do not hesitate to take a class that she teaches!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	245423	2/7/08	She takes her job very seriously And has to be the nicest teacher that ive met so far at RIT. She does her best to help and make the students life easier
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	4	4	245423	1/21/08	She has a way of teaching that makes it quite easy to understand the material. Her office hours are extremely helpful. She does not assign homework that doesnt have an answer sheet or the answers in the back of the book. She assigns the homework at the beginning of the week that is due on friday morning right before the quiz.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	245423	5/11/10	Comment say it all. Take this teacher. Don't mess around in her class. Pay attention. Get an A. Its that simple.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	245423	3/26/10	Took Discrete for tech 2 with her. No complaints whatsoever. I bombed one unit test but ended up with a 101 on the final thanks to the attendance bonus bringing me to a not-so-hard A in the class. Buy the textbook, the homework comes from there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	4	5	5	4	245423	2/16/10	Awesome professor all around
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	4	4	4	2	245423	1/27/10	Great professor, She knows Discrete math very well and has been teaching it here at RIT for 7+ years. She is very organized and straight forward about the class's structure. She notifies students of homework / assignments in various ways and makes a real effort to make the class very do-able.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	245423	10/26/09	She is incredible. If you show up to class and pay attention and take notes you should be fine. If you happen to miss class she always has slides on MyCourses. She's a fair and quick grader and she emails you with updates. If you fall behind she's always willing to catch you back up during office hours. Definitely take a course with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	245423	10/12/09	The best professor I've had at RIT so far. Show up to class and don't fall asleep. She's amazing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	4	5	1	245423	3/26/09	Took Discrete for Tech 1&2 with her, easiest classes ever. All class information is on myCourses, bonus points for attendence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	1	Mathematics	320	2	3	2	3	245423	5/14/08	She's realistic and nice. But as a teacher she can be confusing sometimes. Teaches directly instead of making sure the students understand. She's very stern. Overall she's not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	1/28/08	Had her for Discrete math Tech 1&2 (205/206). great teacher! bonus points are ridiculous for attendance! her workload is fair, appropriate in amount, and she grades extremely well. I'm sad I cant take her next quarter! Highly Recommend!!! A+++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	3	4	4	3	245423	11/12/07	Great math teacher. very fair grader. quizzes and tests fairly hard but homeworks and attendance points were gifts. Show up to class and you will get 5 points on your exam. and a 100 on a homework will cancel out a bad quiz. Also, she drops the lowest HW & Quiz. Highly recommend her lectures move fast, but she will help you after class if need be
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	1	Mathematics	101	3	3	3	4	245423	10/29/07	Awesome teacher. Very personable, very flexible with extra credit and attendance to class (if you show up at another time for that class, she'll mark you having attended). Homework is easy grades. If you have a chance, get in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	1	Mathematics		5	3	2	2	245423	11/15/06	She shoots down the material so fast that you cant possibly learn in class. That said, she is the easiest teacher ever. She tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests, and gives credit for just doing the homework. Shes also an incredibly nice woman.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	245423	10/5/06	If you are not a "math person," you are left to learn it on your own. I feel like I am annoying her when I don't understand, and it's not that I'm an idiot; I just need a teacher to TEACH me. Runs through notes and simply cannot translate math into English, which is what I need. I don't know what these 5 other people are raving about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	5	5	5	3	245423	10/18/05	This professor makes the class very easy to understand and do well in. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	245423	4/6/04	Great Teacher, i can understand her clearly!! she is awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	5	3	245423	10/22/07	She is easily the best math teacher I've ever had. Bonus points galore for showing up to class, easy credit for HW and she grades everything right away. Shes extremely nice too!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics	206	5	5	5	4	245423	10/25/06	Had her for Discrete for IT 1 and 2, and Data Analysis. You get bonus points on your test for showing up to class, homework is graded for completion, always willing to help you if you need it. She will get you to pass her class if she has to, uses my courses a lot. Grades pretty easy. Great professor, why else would I take 3 classes from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Oehlbeck	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	245423	1/31/06	Very clear to understand. Best teacher for math. I would reccommend.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business		1	2	2	1	1487049	2/26/13	Toughest grader I have ever faced so far. She complicates everything and is very demotivating when she does not value your work. I do not know why she is even a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	2	Business		3	4	3	3	1487049	8/2/12	she made the classes seem more complicated and harder than it seems
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	2	Business	320	4	5	5	5	1487049	5/24/12	She was a great professor. The class was full of interesting discussions, many different perspectives coming from students. There was an individual essay every week, which was fairly easy as long as you take the time to do it. I receieved 100s on all of them. Test were pretty difficult, but they were all multiple choice. I recommend this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business	301	2	1	2	3	1487049	11/14/11	The material was all common sence. She tried making this class harder than it should have been. Tests were the opposite of what she said they would be. The ironic part of organizational behavior is the fact that she designs a project that forces teams to disregard everything we have been taught. Writing a group paper is an oxymoron. It only takes 1
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business	320	2	2	1	3	1487049	5/20/11	The class is very bored and not great professor. Her exams are so hard!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	2	Business		5	3	4	4	1487049	1/27/11	Joy is a sweet lady. She's very young and tried very hard to become a good teacher. Maybe one day she will be one. Her class was a bit boring because she always said abvious things. But if u read and somehow try to pay attention in class ur A is garanteed
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	2	Business	320	2	4	4	1	1487049	11/12/12	Slow to process grades and report back to you, can actually be a detriment to your grade. Tests require an excellent understanding of the material to do well on (more so than most). Grading is deceptively harsh with points taken off for almost any reason. Not an unpleasant teacher overall but probably more difficult than it should be because of her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	1	Business	320	1	2	3	2	1487049	5/29/12	Nice lady. Seems smart. Get ready for PPT overload. Very slow at grading. Slowest of any professor by 3x. Tests very tricky. Class average on 1st test was 70. Would not recommend. Find someone else. Makes easy concepts difficult with test questions. Class was pretty boring 85% of the time. Had unique ideas but mostly PPT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business	320	1	1	2	2	1487049	11/15/11	This professor is really an ass-hole and stu-pid woman on the campus! We hate her grade style due to delay a lot! Do not recommend to take with her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business	201	2	2	2	3	1487049	10/17/11	Not helpful at all. Talks too fast. Ignore the dates and just bump up a couple of days earlier than assignments should be due. Group up people without letting people pick their team. It's irony that she teaches organizational behavior when she's not really showing us any difference.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joy Oguntebi	2.6	0	Business	320	1	1	2	1	1487049	5/20/11	She is not great professor as well as young. RIT students are way better than her lecture! The class is very boring!!!! Her exams are very strange and not help a lot. * NOTE for deaf student, do not take her class because she doesn't care if you need an additional time to take the exams or not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting	550	3	5	4	5	569565	11/9/11	Very interesting and caring professor; treats students with respect, and has a lot of life experiences to contribute. You will learn a lot, but will have to do a lot of studying outside of class to keep up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting	101	2	4	3	4	569565	5/20/11	High expectations and this class is hard. If you want to succeed, do work out of class. People who say he's a bad professor are just too lazy to take time out of class to understand the concepts. He challenges you and you will learn a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting	440	1	1	1	1	569565	11/11/10	Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! He has his favorite students and he only likes you if you're a genius. Everyone else is stupid to him. Tests are way too long and you fail not because you don't have enough time to finish. Even with open book and notes its hard to get above a C. Doesn't know how to explain anything! Avoid him at all costs. Please!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting	410	1	1	1	3	569565	10/14/10	Absolute worst professor I have ever had. Really don't understand how he is still around with all of the complaints he gets. Does not know how to communicate what he knows and makes you feel like you are retarded when you have no idea what he is asking for.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		2	2	1	1	569565	5/18/09	this teacher is absolutely horrible. avoid him at all costs. he is probably one of most incompetent teacher in our school. one time a student pointed out that his lesson was wrong. he stood there looking at his own work and didn't know how to correct it and said "ok let's move onto something else". this really happened. idk how he got hired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	1	2	2	569565	4/3/09	when i take classes with oliver, it really reminds me that being smart doesn't necessarily make someone a good professor. All the previous comments are not understated at all. His tests are extremely difficult in incomprehensible. walk the other way!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	1	Accounting	408	1	3	2	3	569565	11/14/08	He reminds me of the cartoon. "Mr. Magoo" He takes forever to get to the point. He does try to get the class involved, but when many are asked questions by him, most of the time no one is listening. He is boring. Try to stay awake, but it will be difficult. Even with an open book test, you can hope to get a "c".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	1	1	1	569565	3/17/08	By far the worst professor ever. Doesn't teach how to do the problems. Tests are hard. And to top it off he is boring to sit through. My advice... run the other way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		3	2	2	5	569565	10/9/06	Prof. makes assumptions about your knowledge about accounting. This is an intermediate class. You need to do your homework before class or lectures will make no sense anyways. Prof. knows accounting but has a hard time conveying it to students. You should be really interested in accounting if you want to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	1	1	3	569565	10/23/05	if you're not an accounting major avoid this guy at all costs. he's an awful teacher, isn't helpful, and his lectures are painful to sit through
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting	101	2	4	3	3	569565	5/22/11	Very helpful professor. He knows his stuff, but makes students think for themselves. Tests are partially open book, but don't let that fool you. This class is very challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting	101	2	4	4	5	569565	11/24/10	I enjoyed having Professor Oliver, and will be taking more classes from him. He does expect you to do the assigned work ahead of time; if you don't, you will be lost and thus complain as many people here have. However, the textbook is excellent, and if you read and study it you will learn a lot. His expectations are high, but reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting	550	1	1	2	1	569565	10/31/10	Terrible Professor. Please don't take him. He really needs to retire. This class is for someone willing to teach themselves everything from scratch! He doesn't really go over much in class, but if he does he always gets the problem wrong 'cause he write the wrong numbers. He honestly needs to retire, and RIT needs to hire someone younger!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	1	1	1	569565	10/31/09	Avoid Business Ethics! Terrible at teaching it. Tests are impossible and aren't relevant to anything. Either reads from book or tells unclear story(which is on the test) expects you to memorize every page of text. Not worth it. Take with a better teacher or liberal arts ethics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	2	1	1	569565	5/4/09	Terrible. All the negative reviews here are spot on. Unclear in lessons, avoids answering questions, impossible tests, and thinks everything can be explained with journal entries alone. Knows a lot, but can't communicate it. Probably thinks the reason you don't get the material, is because you are a young wippersnapper who needs to be coddled.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		3	1	1	3	569565	3/19/09	awful!!!! I've never had a worse teacher before!! he's the type of teacher to walk around with the class list in an attempt to suddenly shoot a questions at students. When you don't understand the question, and ask him to evaluate, he just goes on to the next person without giving us a chance to answer it. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	2	2	2	569565	8/14/08	Dr. Oliver was one of the worst professors I have ever taken a class from. His teaching is erratic and unclear, he doesn't explain concepts in class (instead he expects students to learn them by reading them from the textbook and doing HW problems on them), and he doesn't review all HW assignments. His retirement's close and you can tell.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting	202	1	1	1	1	569565	11/19/07	Worst professor ever taking at RIT. Expected everyone to know about accounting before even entering the class. He is all over the place .. never sticks to a specific topic, very confusing. Avoid at all costs unless accounting is your concentration. It sure hell isn't mine and I might be taking this class again cuz I learned nothing from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting		3	5	5	4	569565	12/1/05	Prof. Oliver was one of the best teachers I've had. In addition to Accounting, I took Ethics in a Tech Env from him. Class discussions were always interesting and relevant and assignments were helpful. He expects you to work hard, so I think that's probably where some people have a problem with him - they just don't want to do the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	2	Accounting		4	3	4	1	569565	7/23/05	I thought this guy was very straight and to the point, as accting teachers should be. He wasn't the most helpful guy in the world but almost everyone in my class had an A or a B, so obviously something was working.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	0	Accounting		1	2	2	2	569565	5/2/05	Teaches the class backwards, expects you to know the material before the class, no reinforcement basically a waste. If you do not know accouting this professor won't make it any better, you bascially have to teach yourself. overall a terrible professor, my advice find someone else!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Oliver	2.2	1	Accounting		2	3	2	3	569565	2/13/05	No assignments and three tests. Thats pretty much it. If you are good at teaching yourself concepts straight from the book, this is the class for you. If you need assignments and supportive material throughout the quarter to reinforce course ideas and material, consider another teacher. Monotone
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Olles	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1137640	7/22/08	Dr. Olles is awesome!! He has a lot of experience, not just as an engineer with a PhD but mechanically as well. He even told us about how he can machine parts and build cars, motors, etc. He has what it takes to be a great engineer. He is also a great teacher. He took a class that could be pretty boring, and made it really interesting and fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering		1	5	2	3	1201507	11/9/12	The Professor is tough. He teaches at an accelerated pace, and if you do not speak up you will be left behind. He shows outstanding dedication to his students and is willing to help all the time, often staying in School late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	1	Electrical Engineering	101	3	4	2	4	1201507	10/28/12	Dr. Orlicki is a genus, but has trouble getting info across to students. His labs are difficult and extra help is necessary. Not a good professor for novices. He is very lenient, and will allow you to retake missed exams. He is far more helpful with one on one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	4	3	1201507	3/5/12	Enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the subjects covered. Can sometimes be confusing but is very happy to clarify any topics and questions. My advice to people who find him difficult is to ask for clarification and continue to do so until you truly understand. Overall I loved the guy, he was interesting with some fun jokes and stories.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering		2	3	1	2	1201507	11/17/11	He is definitely a genius, but not a good teacher. He rambles on about the subject and goes too far ahead and the class gets very confused. He gives labs every week, in which you almost always need his help with, but his office is packed during office hour with kids who need help. He wants to help and will try to help but he is terrible atexplaning
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	682	1	1	1	4	1201507	5/18/11	not great at teaching definitely a genius but he is not a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering	101	3	5	3	2	1201507	11/28/09	He really is a good guy interested in helping his students. Not very captivating in lecture classes but very reasonable and helpful in the lab. Even if you can't stay awake in his class, make sure you do your homework and stay behind for help in the lab. At a computer, he really gives his all to the student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	438	3	1	3	5	1201507	11/10/08	This guy seems like a nice old man, but he is a HORRIBLE teacher. He spends days on end storytelling or discussing one of the simplest concepts at the expense of several more complicated ones. When it comes to tests just forget it. He tests on probems out of the book - none of the material is covered in class! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	4	1201507	10/31/12	The Best Professor I have ever taken. Is willing to sit one on one to explain a question no matter what time it is. The tests are easy similiar to HW. So HW is a must.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	1	Electrical Engineering		1	3	2	4	1201507	5/1/12	Brilliant professional, just not a very good teacher for basic principle classes. Very willing to help with any issues, but usually does not have time unless you get to office hours early. Labs are extremely work intensive. Only take this guy if you already have a basic understanding of subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	0	Electrical Engineering	231	3	2	1	4	1201507	3/4/12	He is a very cool and fun guy but he can't deliver the info clearly. One on one might work fine or his office hours. If you know the material go ahead and take the class otherwise you will struggle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	2	Electrical Engineering		4	4	3	2	1201507	10/26/11	A smart guy but if you do not understand what is going on in class then you will struggle. Seek him during "office hours" He will give sufficient time in order to help you understand and get through the class. Overall a good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	1	Electrical Engineering	381	3	3	3	4	1201507	3/14/11	He's a nice guy, although his lectures are quite boring. He often didn't give enough time for exams as well. Homework was assigned straight from the text, which I basically learned everything from instead of him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Orlicki	2.9	1	Electrical Engineering	411	2	3	2	3	1201507	1/31/09	He is a good guy, overall sound. But when it comes to teaching and conveying a message he is not efficient. Talks about things not related to solve HWs and Test qs in class. 80% people are sleeping. Rather choose another professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Orwin	2.3	1	Film	383	4	3	3	4	136838	11/18/10	Writing Comedy for the Situation - fun class. lots of improv at the start and an episode of a sitcom and work on our homework. Knows how to keep class interesting, but maybe not the best at giving us constructive criticism on our scripts. Fun, and understanding. Didnt try as hard as I should have but still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Orwin	2.3	2	Film		2	4	3	5	136838	5/12/10	Naomi is helpful, but you really have to pull the information out of her. Pretty judgmental and preferences women's stories obviously. She's better one on one.

She's not helpful at all during class but if you go talk to her outside of class she makes things a little better. I didn't really like her in this class but she is a nice person and can offer a lot of advice in general.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Orwin	2.3	0	Film	101	2	2	2	3	136838	10/21/09	She's tough. Hard to get a good grade. A feminist. Like's sappy girl stories best, drama! If you have a dude-testosterone-action-packed script, she will probably make you change it. You learn a lot, but take a lot of criticism along the way. Worth it? I don't know. But she's not as bad as everyone says she is. Just intimidating.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Osgood	3.6	0	Medicine		1	1	1	1	1618167	11/20/11	Never take his class. He isn't there to help. When I went to his office to get help he rolled his eyes saying I should have asked questions I had about the test during the test. But funny thing is he wasn't even there to administer the test- ten minutes into when that test was supposed to start a random woman came in to hand out the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Osgood	3.6	2	Medicine		4	5	5	5	1618167	9/15/11	Good prof!! I recommend students who are interested with infectious disease stuff to take his class.Not an easy A but you will understand the course better with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Osgood	3.6	2	Medicine		3	4	3	4	1618167	10/31/11	He started off as a good professor, but went downhill as the quarter progressed. His tests often repeat the same questions more than once and they often cover material we never discussed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Osgood	3.6	2	Medicine		3	5	5	4	1618167	9/13/11	One of the best people to work with. Clear about everything and makes sure you understand and know what is expected of you. Helps out when you don't understand something and makes sure that you do understand it. Great teacher!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts	123	3	5	4	5	692462	2/12/12	Willie is truly incredible. That man basically changed my life. He care a great deal if he see's your effort. He will challenge you very much, but he will also pick you up if you fall. I'm so glad I had him for PA 1 + 2, it definitely helped changed how i saw photo, he know's what he's doing, show him you care and you'll succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	4	4	692462	10/21/11	Willie is a great teacher. I had him for the first two quarters and he definitely changed the way I think and shoot. The crits are good, can be hard, because he can be inconsistent. He knows what he is doing so take everything he says into consideration. He can be unclear at times, but if you keep good communication it is definitely worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	692462	3/25/09	Willie is one of the best photo teachers I've ever had. He knows what he's talking and I really respect him. He is tough but worth it. The critiques are hard, but he gives great advice and pushes you to become a better photographer. I would highly recommend Willie.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	692462	10/23/07	Willie is my first photo at RIT and he is extremely inspirational. Even if you get a poor grade on something, he is always there to get you back on your feet. His critiques are not cutting and won't kill your moral. Great teacher, I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	4	692462	2/6/06	Willie is AMAZING! He may give you a bad grade on an assignment but he grades based on your effort as well. If it's obvious that you really tried then you're fine. He grades hard but I learned SO much from this class. He's very easy to talk to and very willing to help, both in class and outside of class. Always there for advice. HIGHLY recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	4	4	692462	1/30/12	Willie is a great teacher. His assignments allow you to be creative, though sometimes they can be challenging. The critiques may seem harsh but they really help you to grow as a photographer.I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	692462	5/22/09	Great professor. To notch!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	692462	11/3/07	Willie is my first photo arts professor here, and he has met and exceeded all of my expectations as a photo teacher at RIT. He is pretty chill, but he is also a challenging teacher, and tends to grade a little harder than some. He keeps the class lighthearted, but still is a very effective teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	692462	8/23/06	Willie was such an inspirational teacher some days when I wasn't so sure about what I wanted to achieve as a photographer I would attend class and leave newly inspired and ready to accept anything as a possibility. I learned so much from this man and have the utmost respect for him as a photographer and a human being.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Willie Osterman	4.5	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	4	3	692462	11/8/05	Willie is amazing! Take his class if you can!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	2	Computer Science	323	5	5	4	4	134531	5/20/12	Simply one of the best profs at RIT, especially in the IGM program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	2	Computer Science	347	2	5	4	5	134531	3/22/12	By far one of the best teachers I've had. The subject matter (Maya) was quite hard, but she made it easy and entertaining. I found myself happy to stay for the full 4 or 5 hours of class time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	3	134531	11/24/09	Weez is probably one of the best teachers out there.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	2	Computer Science	757	4	5	5	3	134531	5/15/12	Prof. Oyzon is the best professor I have had at RIT. She is extremely knowledge, will go very far out of her way to help and is just all around nice. She specifically had us choose projects we were passionate about just to make sure we did quality work that we would learn a lot from. I recommend her to any student as she will make it worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	0	Computer Science	309	2	1	2	1	134531	10/31/11	She was "too cool to teach". She was nice, but not my taste. The class was in total chaos all the time. There was very little to no structure in the class. After week 3 (or so), the objective of every class was: "work on your next project"... Which would have been OK if I would have been able to concentrate on my work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eloise Oyzon	4.5	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	134531	10/23/05	Awesome professor who is interested in the material and presents it very well. I enjoyed her class a lot. Two thumbs up!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Palmer	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	1340456	11/15/11	He's incredibly enthusiastic and obviously loves what he's teaching. On top of that, he's fair with his grades and probably one of the most helpful guys on campus. Take a class with him if you get the chance. The only con is that he isn't a reliable grader, but everything gets done eventually.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Palmer	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	1340456	3/20/11	Harvey is the man! Sure he rambles a lot, but when you get used to him he's probably the most badass mother effer to ever walk on this earth. I'm pretty sure he has patents, and he's on Forbes... need I say more? Also he drinks a lot of Seltzer water.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Palmer	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1340456	10/17/11	Dr. Palmer is just the best, no contest. If you have the chance to take a class with him, just take it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harvey Palmer	4.6	2	Engineering		2	4	3	5	1340456	10/27/09	Good guy, rambles on about a lot of things. Loves talking. Very straight forward guy. Lets class out early often. Makes topics interesting, but can also make then boring by extensive lecturing. Approachable guy by all means, I recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	764859	2/28/12	Some of the best slides i've ever seen from a professor. Always available and helpful. One of the best professors i've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology	581	4	4	3	5	764859	11/20/11	Very nice professor, and an easy grader. Lectures are dry, mostly reading through a powerpoint but she is very helpful during lab. She curved the midterm and final as well so that was nice too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology	841	4	5	3	3	764859	1/28/11	Good professor. She really knows her stuff but her lectures can get a bit dry. Labs and projects are pretty interesting and make you think. Class has choice of harder labs for experienced students and easier labs for inexperienced students. She is very friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	764859	11/25/05	I really enjoyed this class... I learned quite a bit even though I have a lot of UNIX experience already. She's very friendly and willing to help students. Has a bit of an accent, but she's not hard to understand. Notes are posted online so you won't fall behind if you miss class. Work is fairly easy and she'll give hints if you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology	585	5	5	5	5	764859	11/26/11	So glad to have Yin for Auditing lecture. She prepares well and is one of the few NSSA professors who actually revises slides quarter to quarter. Really cares about her students and their learning.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology	841	4	4	4	4	764859	11/9/11	Knows her stuff. Grad level class was obviously just a reworked undergrad level class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yin Pan	4.4	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	2	764859	2/6/08	Great professor! The slides and lectures get a bit boring, but she definitely knows her stuff and gives great examples. Very willing to help students who need it, and is flexible for a lot of things. Will give help with homework and project assignments, and is a fair grader. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	3	1099224	11/10/09	awesome teacher. addresses many learning styles. he is active, engaging, uses the text book then explains it in his own words. his stories are always very funny but always relate so that it gives you a better understanding. wish i could take more of his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	3	1099224	5/17/09	This guy is great, really easy to talk to.Used to be a patrolman with the Monroe Sheriffs Dept.Now he is just does background checks for the county, as well as some training at the police academy.Class was straight forward. He gave us a syllabus and stuck to it. 4 quizzes, 1 paper, and 1 presentation. No final or midterm. Definitely an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	1	Criminal Justice	400	3	2	4	2	1099224	11/6/08	Professor can be a bit off but if you can put up with that then he's a good teacher to take a class with. Sometimes professor can be a bit unfriendly but overall is helpful. Does only do 4 quizzes and a final presentation. Curves if overall class average is terrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	400	3	5	5	3	1099224	11/9/09	Awesome Professor. He is really funny and keep the class interesting with lots of stories. Easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	501	4	5	4	5	1099224	11/11/08	Even though I'm a business management major and this is my first CJ course I've ever taken and I actually enjoyed the class. He was a police officer and he would share his experiences with us. I love his stories and it applies a lot to the course. He have a great sense of humor. The quizzes and assignments (essays) are VERY easy. NO FINALS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Paoni	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	501	5	4	5	5	1099224	5/14/08	Best teacher I've ever had. No assignments taken but writing essays are required; only 3. Usually passes out three quizzes which are quite easy. Definitely take him if you have to...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	2	Sociology	451	2	4	3	4	1487693	2/21/13	Good class overall. She is very passionate about her work and it shows in her teaching. Pardee is fair but challenging. Journal assignment, readings and quiz each week. quite a bit of weekly work but it is on interesting topics. Group project and paper, as well as essay midterm and essay final. If you aren't afraid to do work, you will do well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	2	Sociology		2	4	3	3	1487693	1/30/12	She assigns a decent amount of regular homework, and a few papers/projects. Some adjustments have been made to the methods class based on student and peer feedback. Students not only ones to feel workload was both heavy and weighted towards the end of the course when all other courses are hectic too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	0	Sociology		2	1	1	3	1487693	11/21/11	Unbelievable. Tests are worded crazy and unorthodox, completely useless professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	2	Sociology		4	5	5	4	1487693	3/30/11	Good teacher and she's extremely helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	2	Sociology	210	4	5	5	3	1487693	2/20/12	Awesome professor. I have problems with focus & attention but her class was really engaging. She made stuff I always thought was boring interesting. I'm hardcore CS but she got me excited about liberal arts. Very helpful outside of class too. Really smart. Normal amount of work - I've had tons more in other classes. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	0	Sociology		3	2	2	3	1487693	1/8/12	Skips or late to appointments, treats deaf students better than normal students, because she is afraid of talking to them but will say whatever she feels like to the norm students. Assigned WIKI pg she has no idea how to use, isn't helpful when it comes to the website she assigned us to build... class is easy tho, just have to work with groups
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Pardee	3.4	2	Sociology	406	2	2	5	1	1487693	5/4/11	Gives ~90 hours of homework a quarter. Weird wording on tests. Wants you to be over-specific on open-ended questions. Lots of last minute work. Won't learn how to do your 7 page research paper until at most a week before it's due. Tons of work and you have to say exactly what she wants on the tests or you lose a good percentage of points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Parkhill	3.8	1	Biology		5	2	3	5	736757	2/6/06	Dry lecture, but cake tests and quizzes. Bring a pillow and read the text and you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Parkhill	3.8	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	736757	10/25/05	Awesome Teacher! Really Helpful and a really nice personality. Gives Everyone 3 extra points (about 13%) on every exam. Weekly quizzes are 5 true false Qs..easy stuff. Listen to the lectures & its an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Parnett	4.5	2	Writing	213	5	4	4	5	1042178	1/7/09	I took this course at MCC. Very great teacher. Assignments were basically journal entries. Very easy course. We even went to an author discussion at Writers and Books oppose to class that day. This course re-sparked my interest in writing. I would highly recommend it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michelle Parnett	4.5	2	Writing	277	4	5	5	4	1042178	10/23/07	She is a great teacher. Class is easy and discussions are fun. The eassays are not to hard you just have to do them to pass the class. If you try in this course there is no reason why you shouldn't get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	4	5	5	4	1624401	11/27/12	Mohammed is a super cool guy, extremely laid back and a great professor. Wants to make sure everyone learns. Tests are tough but he does plenty of review to make sure your prepared. Grade was based only on tests, so you better study!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	4	3	4	3	1624401	11/7/12	Had him for Microeconomics. It's not an easy class, but Mohammed made it a point to explain everything from the ground up. If you actually go to class and take notes, you should do fine. Grade is based on 5 40 multiple choice exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	5	5	5	4	1624401	11/2/11	He's a humorous person and an awesome teacher. He knows his material and engages with the class. He does get side-tracked a lot, but that's part of his humor. He keeps you attentive and prepared for tests. You need to study for the tests even if there isn't much homework given. Overall: Best Microeconomics teacher I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	1	5	5	4	1624401	10/7/11	Great professor. Hard but, explains the concepts really well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	5	5	5	4	1624401	11/10/12	The best professor I've had so far at RIT. He explained everything extremely well, was humorous, and kept the subject interesting. Class was based solely on 5 multiple choice exams, and I never found them to be difficult. If you attend class and pay attention, you'll get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics	101	4	3	5	3	1624401	1/31/12	The class was hard to stay awake in, but he tries to keep it lively with jokes and such. If you pay attention and take the notes, minimal studying will be required to get a good grade. Multiple choice exams, two out of six were take home. Pretty good teacher that makes easy tests because he really wants everyone to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mohammed Partapurwala	4.6	2	Economics		3	4	5	1	1624401	10/23/11	Professor Mohammed is a great guy. He is always cracking jokes and funny metaphors to help drive his point across. Unfortunately however, it seems that we miss a lot of key things because of it and tests become harder than they should be. Good professor though but just remember to actually study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Paterno	3.0	2	Philosophy		3	4	3	2	738141	11/10/06	Can be boring at times, but really nice guy. Will give you all the one on one help you need, if you really want it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Paterno	3.0	0	Philosophy		2	2	2	4	738141	2/24/06	Boring teacher, 3 or 4 tests which are either multiple choice or essays. usually lets you out of class half hour early. dont relay on just the review sheets.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Paterno	3.0	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	5	738141	3/13/06	Awsome teacher kind of boring sometimes but thats due to subject matter, very helpful when i listened and payed attention

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	2	Philosophy	251	3	5	3	5	752272	6/24/08	Wow, I thought she was much better than previous comments indicate. She struggles with explaining things clearly, but is willing to try over and over again if you go the extra mile and ask. The Lexicon was a bit elementary, but the paper topics were engaging and interesting. She is extremely nice and approachable, and genuinely tries to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	0	Philosophy		2	1	2	1	752272	10/29/06	Avoid this teacher, her class is very difficult unless maybe you are going into philosophy. You think her class is easy, especially at the beginning but her quizes are very difficult. It was hard to get help from her because during her office hours so many kids came in that you have to wait.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	1	Philosophy		2	1	4	3	752272	3/4/06	Terrible class Terrible Professor. She teaches the class like We are philosophy majors and doesnt just give a broad overview of class. Incredibly hard greater. AVerage for the final was 52 percent!! which she curves to a C. Class is boring. Worst class Ive ever taken at RIT. AVOID class and professor at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	1	Philosophy		3	3	3	4	752272	11/28/05	Class is pretty boring. She is a really hard grader, especially towards the end of the class. If you show up to class, you should do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	1	Philosophy		4	2	4	1	752272	11/9/05	Covered material clearly in class, but not very accessible out of class (never responded to emails, few office hours), but if you attend class you should do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	0	Philosophy	251	1	2	1	2	752272	12/10/07	Horrible teacher. Cannot relate information to students. Only gives examples from the book and when asked to explain, gives responses like, "well i'm not sure", "I think", and "maybe they meant". Asks students to do lexicon that people out of class could understand. But can't even teach class in this manner. CANNOT SIMPLIFY CONCEPTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	0	Philosophy		3	2	2	5	752272	8/8/06	Terrible teacher. She often comes off talking as if she knows everything, even though she states she doesn't think that. (My guess is that she subconsciously knows she's arrogent, but is tring to refute it. Hypocracy anyone?) She "wrote" the text for the class - personally, for someone who doesn't garner any respect from anyone, that's pretty bold. AVOID PROFESSOR.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrea Patterson	2.4	1	Philosophy		2	2	3	1	752272	2/16/06	Class is very boring. She teaches right out of her own textbook. VERY strict grader on homework and exams. Somehow pulled an A off despite having grades of B's and C's thorught the quarter. Avoid at all costs.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Pearson	4.2	2	Engineering		3	4	3	3	514186	5/5/10	Mr. Pearson seems like a good guy but hes often very boring during lecture. Hes definitely available during office hour. If he wouldn't slack off during the middle of the quarter falling behind his plan and post supplemental powerpoints like he did in the beginning for his lecture his class would be a very good one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Pearson	4.2	2	Engineering	201	5	5	4	4	514186	11/13/08	Great teacher, keeps class lively. Sometimes goes too technical, but usually not. Very interested in his job. Asks the most randomest bonus questions on the tests (What sport does his son play for RIT? --> Soccer). Tests are very easy. You have to be a real loser to not get an A in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Pearson	4.2	2	Engineering	201	5	5	4	4	514186	1/26/10	Very helpful teacher. Explained ideas and concepts clearly. Enthusiastic about this class. Stuff can be difficult in spots, but he explains as clearly as he can so the students are able to understand it. Very approachable and is willing to help when you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Pearson	4.2	2	Engineering		3	4	5	5	514186	11/29/04	Awesome lecturer!! Some of his quiz questions are a little tricky, but no surprises, usually does a review before a test and has everything on it. It shows that he is truely excited about Micro E, its really awesome when a teacher teaches something they love and ARE GOOD AT IT!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		2	3	4	1	1100725	9/4/12	He's well-organized with students but he will never understand how students' feel about their grade with some situations. He does not give a care! if you have a health problem or other reasons for not attending class, Do not recommend this one!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	320	3	3	4	2	1100725	11/19/11	He is a nice professor and kind of funny. Went into the class thinking it was going to be easy but it was hard. basic concepts that are really hard. Decent professor who knows what he is talking about but is extremely strict about the topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	1	Business		2	3	2	3	1100725	5/8/11	Had him for organizational leadership. He is extremely strict on deadlines and if it's not in by the time class starts then he will deduct points. His quizams are fair, but the team project was killer (requires your team to teach the class for 60 min). He's approachable and doesn't always collect homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	101	5	5	5	4	1100725	4/21/10	Took both org behavior and leadership with him. awesome teacher. no boring powerpoints, lots of videos and just a interesting guy to listen to his lecture. "Quizams" are based on memory of material, fill in the blank so just need to study to know lists of concepts. HIGHLY recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		4	3	4	3	1100725	2/1/10	Easy content, for the class, but the way it is presented conflicts with the textbook. You will find yourself guessing who to listen to: Him, the book, or yourself? Sometimes tests are worded poorly, but he presents most of the information clearly and tries to make things fun with movie clips. However, sometimes he is condescending.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	302	4	3	4	3	1100725	11/9/09	I had him for OB, very good professor, the material is somewhat boring but he gets it across. He shows a lot of movie clips (including Office Space, can't beat that), and the team project is really interesting and easy. And he's a really nice guy. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	0	Business	590	1	1	1	1	1100725	5/19/09	I had him for MGMT 590E (graduate course), got a "C" grade. He seemed as though he despised the class from day one. One time he even stormed out of class in a tantrum. Seemed like an alright guy but was a horrible professor with little patience for students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		4	4	5	4	1100725	4/28/08	Keeps lectures interesting, but tests are impossible and he does not curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	101	3	5	4	4	1100725	8/27/12	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	320	4	4	4	2	1100725	10/29/11	He is very set in his ways, and it is his way or the highway. If you follow his instructions to the letter you will do well, but it can be a bit annoying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		4	4	4	2	1100725	4/10/11	Smart guy. Doesn't stuff powerpoints down your throat. Lots of discussion time. "Quizams" are fair. Kind of smug, but there are worse teachers out there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		4	5	5	5	1100725	2/18/10	Dr. Palanski is one good teacher. His exams are tricky sometimes, but you will find it easy if you study everything what he presented in his lectures. He is very nice to everyone (In my opinion!) I might take more classes with him for Management.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business	302	3	5	5	4	1100725	11/23/09	Dr. Palanski is a great teacher. I can not recommend him enough. He makes the class very interesting and got me interested in OB. I wish I could take more classes with him. His tests are tricky but not difficult if you study for them and a optional final is always really nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	0	Business	740	1	2	2	4	1100725	8/13/09	The class average for the final exam was a "C", which shows that either the exam was not well designed, or the class "did not get it". If the first, the instructor has to urgently improve his test item-writing techniques. If the second, the instructor has to definitely improve his presentation skills so that the material is clear to the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Palanski	3.8	2	Business		3	5	5	3	1100725	11/19/08	I had OB with prof palanski: He was very kind and caring to all students. Would even meet us for coffee just to talk! Very helpful! I highly recommend him!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Melissa Palmer	4.0	2	Finance		4	4	4	4	751797	11/9/05	There's a lot of material covered but she's good at explaining everything. There's group work and a final project, 3 tests. Test info. is straight from her powerpoint slides. Easy to get an A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		5	5	5	5	149699	2/22/13	I had him for Written Communication II. He was one of the best English professors. His lecture and strategy for writing in class was so unbelievable! I learned everything from him and help me prepare in Writing Seminar. If you want your grade in good standing, follow what he says and do well on not-so-hard quizzes. I recommended you to take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English	502	4	4	4	5	149699	3/24/11	He is a good teacher. If you look for a good professor for Written Communication II, then go take this professor. Just trust me. I am currently in his Written Communication II class this quarter. I learned a lot from him. Btw, he is a very straightforward person. Just be careful what you say to him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	1	English	261	2	2	3	4	149699	10/13/10	He's one of challenge professors but he's not feeling bad about his students well. He's using high expectations about essays and quizzes. We all love him because he knows how to make us laugh during the class. If you have him then you must read a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English	502	1	5	5	5	149699	5/5/10	Prof. Panara is arguably the best writing teachers, hands down. He is easy to approach and enjoys talking with you outside of class time. I had to write a paper worth 2000 words.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		1	5	5	5	149699	4/18/10	If you're looking for a flexible one, this is not for you. Very strict, very picky about tardiness and absences. If he tells you he'll be flexible, trust me, he's not. If you're in the Panara plays, he won't give a good grade just because you're in the plays. He'll be very tough. A nice man. Tough grader, I got a C, and I'm a RIT student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		4	5	5	5	149699	9/14/05	he is AWESOME teacher and he is very picky but it don't bother me. Lots of homeworks but mostly are not like ALL essays just few essays and few other homeworks. he's keeping it balance to make sure students to get the concept and understanding. I recommand students to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		3	5	5	5	149699	2/7/05	Excellent and motivated teacher! Lots of homeworks, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		1	5	5	3	149699	8/5/12	Professor Panara is one of the best professors I have ever had. However, he overloades his students. He has high expectation and gives lots of homeworks. If you are good in English and want to have a good writing skills, Take his class!! I promise you will be thankful for taking his class when you move to writing Seminar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	0	English		1	2	1	2	149699	2/2/11	He is not really helpful to emphasize the students on essays because he expects them to be independently working by themselves. It is almost impossible to get an A. Do not take this class if you are not good writing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		1	4	5	4	149699	5/17/10	Easy? NO. Flexible? NO. Tough? Extremely. He is a great teacher, but don't even look for an easy A, you have to work for it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		4	5	5	4	149699	4/20/10	Took him twice for Reading and Writing; he is one awesome professor ever! Extremely open-minded and loves to talk about sports. Likes to mingle and chat with students during class, but be careful to pay attention or he'll make you a target out of the entire class and embarrass you which he doesn't do very often, but consider yourself warned.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		3	5	5	5	149699	9/17/05	He is AWESOME teacher in NTID history. He always love picky to students about the homework or late for class during the class because he is very strictly man. But, he is still very soft heart to our students!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	2	English		3	5	5	5	149699	9/11/05	He's great teacher! However, he does give a lot of work and expect a lot from us. He explain things very well. Students just need to take him seriously and he'll glad and give you more respect if you do your work well enough
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Panara	4.2	0	English	101	1	1	1	NULL	149699	3/13/03	not helpful or understanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	0	Science Technology & Society		2	2	2	2	560585	4/24/12	All oral lecture, barely no class participation. Quizzes every week. Questions are wordy, exams not too hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society	210	3	3	4	3	560585	5/10/11	Man this class bad! It isn't that hard, but i would take another Liberal arts class over this! Oh don't even bother reading the books. Just write your book reviews off his summary or find one online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society		3	4	5	4	560585	8/20/10	66
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society	446	2	4	4	2	560585	4/29/10	Professor loves to teach modern history, you get the feeling he could continue speaking about certain individuals continuously. He tries to spark the interest of students with cartoons, though his humor can be a bit dry. It's a fairly decent class though some might complain about the amount of reading required and the rather long paper you'll need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	0	Science Technology & Society		3	1	2	3	560585	4/28/09	Man is this guy dry! If you know what he is talking about you'll pick up on his witticisms. Regardless, you'll probably have a hard time paying attention. You read two books and write a review on each in addition to a paper. There is a quiz at random times each week. His style is to give you a summary of a book then quiz you as if you read it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	1	Science Technology & Society	444	2	2	3	4	560585	10/15/07	Interesting professor. Relies entirely on book. Quizzes are difficult unless you read for comprehension very well. LOTS of reading. Out of a 2 hour class, only 1 hour worth was allotted for midterm which required a long essay on top of several pages of short answer. Conclusion... class is hard, but content decent. Professor could be more organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	1	Science Technology & Society		2	3	3	1	560585	5/23/06	This professor definitely forgot there are other classes that require more work. He assigns way too much work and material for tests and quizes. Hes somewhat entertaining when he jumps around the room shouting french or chinese words just because he likes the language. Somewhat interesting class but NOT an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	1	Science Technology & Society		5	3	3	4	560585	3/7/05	He is a very strange professor, some of the things that he says are way out there, and i think he should have retired about 10 years ago. Some advice, grab the reading summary and leave after the first hour, i did this and still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society		4	3	4	2	560585	1/24/05	He's an interesting guy. Quizzes are easy if you read the worksheets he hands out, and tests arent bad at all. Basically no hw at all except reading two short books (1 in the 1st half, 1 in the 2nd half). Can be boring, but worth it if you want to boost your GPA :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society		3	4	5	4	560585	12/4/11	His course is 100% oral lecture. There are no visual aids/slides/etc... You have the option to either be very good at taking notes, or to read the books. The exams may contain things not covered in lecture. The final requires 3 essays. He will require book research for the med-long term paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	1	Science Technology & Society		3	2	3	2	560585	4/25/11	He should have retired a while ago. Consistently rambles. Textbooks are two books for book reviews, which he goes over in class. Some of the stuff he teaches is wrong(perhaps he misunderstood) or dated, so be careful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	1	Science Technology & Society		4	1	4	4	560585	6/7/10	Should have retired long ago. Very boring. I read the textbook during class to study for the weekly quizzes. If you study for the quizzes and midterm/final and read the textbook, you will do fine. Entertaining when he laughs at his own jokes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society	442	3	4	4	3	560585	5/27/09	He's a pretty good teacher, he talks a lot and shows pictures and maps. Quizzes weren't too hard, you only have to answer 10 of 12 questions and he drops the two lowest quiz grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society	101	2	4	4	4	560585	1/23/08	The class was interesting, the professor was also interesting. It was a decent amount of work but I found the subject (and instructor) interesting enough to consider the course worthwhile.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society		4	3	4	1	560585	7/11/07	He's entertaining alright. Loves cartoons! I didn't find the class to be too difficult. If you like classes where your grade is solely based on quizzes/tests/1 paper.. this is the class for you. He doesn't care if you show up, well maybe he cares, but he's too old to notice. Nice guy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	2	Science Technology & Society		5	4	5	4	560585	9/6/05	OK. The guy is a little dry. He's old. But he's so into his subject that if you have the slightest interest, he's fascinating. When I get bored with the class material, I just watch this guy. He's 6 foot something crazy and has all these weird twitches tha
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Paradowski	3.2	0	Science Technology & Society		3	2	2	1	560585	1/30/05	Wow, what a boring class! Skipped out of class after the first hour (was two hour class) and still got a "B". He assigns you two books to read the entire quarter. Don't bother reading them as he will hand out a summary sheet before class even starts. Just answer his questions right off the sheet
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brendan Parker	4.5	2	Information Technology	320	3	4	5	4	1480211	10/21/10	Good Professor, I liked how he went a little above and beyond with the course material. A lot of ICE's but it helps to learn the concept of the class. I'm sure as time progress he will be the top professor in the web development field.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ahndraya Parlato	5.0	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	1725099	5/18/12	Ahndraya is a great Photography teacher. She helped me think outside the box and improve my printing quality. I still go to her with my work because I really respect her advise. She is also an extremely talented photographer. I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Parody	3.7	2	Mathematics	782	4	4	5	5	1042095	11/10/11	Professor Parody was terrific during my Fall 2010 Quality Engineering Class. Lectures were well planned, interesting; and lasted the entire class period. We did have a break or two during each one-night-per-week class. Professor Parody did not cut corners or rely on endless scientific notation. His examples were practical.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Parody	3.7	0	Mathematics	250	3	2	2	3	1042095	10/6/08	Way to into theory, made class much harder than it had to be
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Parody	3.7	2	Mathematics	315	5	5	4	4	1042095	11/13/08	Cool guy, likes fantasy football and films. Hates Titanic. Loves The Dark Knight. Not way into theory, teaches you exactly what u need in coops and stuff. Makes tests very easy and straightforward and preps a lot for them (study guides, etc). Willing to look at you did and what your thought process was and often gives u more points. TAKE HIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering		1	4	3	1	580709	5/10/11	Average grade on his labs is in the 60s because everybody loses 20+ points on the landmines he's hidden in each lab...of course he never mentions this until well after he's harshly graded you. Grader tells you how to title graphs & grades fairly as a result; Parthum randomly takes over a section's grading & penalizes you for "bad graph titles".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	580709	3/11/08	Good teacher... knows a good amount(a huge amount about wafers)... can be hard at times at grading... good tests and quiz's... an amazing lecturer and clear concepts...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	0	Engineering	506	1	1	1	1	580709	12/23/07	Another one of the MET program's worst. He may be qualified to make wafers, but he is not qualified to teach. Lecture notes are scans of the textbook, and he just reads them. A senior level class and the only thing i know from going to class is that he's wasting my time. Fire the Xerox and Kodak leftovers and get some qualified teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	580709	9/10/05	A very informative professor with industry experience and insight. Makes you do your work, but is very available for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	1	Engineering		3	3	2	2	580709	3/15/05	Parthum was ok. His quizzes were very unclear. He admited to putting trick questions on his quizzes. Just gives you notes right from the book. Fairly lenient on grading too. You will learn more with him than with Castro, but Castro grades easier.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering	407	3	5	4	3	580709	2/26/09	I don't know what the other students problems are (maybe they did not get it, or were too lazy to do the work) but Prof. Parthum has been one of the best teachers I have had here at RIT. You may have to work hard and he is VERY detail orientated, but I am paying a LOT to go here and I learned more in his classes than anyone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	1	Engineering	420	3	3	3	4	580709	3/3/08	Overly strict, but in the end it works out kindasorta. He treats his students like employees to the end. I agree with the previous; I get the impression that he fabricates many stories and experiences. Don't get the book (nontrad), read the notes for quizzes, write the papers well, kill yourself for the project and with great luck you will get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	580709	2/28/06	very good teacher highly recomeneded. He knows his stuff and is good at teaching and answering questions. He is a fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Parthum	3.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	580709	8/29/05	Good guy, knows his stuff. One of RIT's up and coming professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering	347	2	4	5	5	1104734	1/2/13	An excellent teacher. Goes very fast on material and does not answer questions well. Tests are extremely challenging and labs are a lot of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering	365	3	4	4	4	1104734	5/24/12	Very helpful, available, and willing to help students. Labs are absolutely insane though. Way to much work. He definitely pushes you and expects a lot. Lectures and notes are not crystal clear, but he is extremely helpful in office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering	347	5	5	4	4	1104734	12/2/11	Took this class in Winter 10-11. Incredibly easy class as long as you do the homework. Have a question? Go see him, he will explain the answer perfectly! Great professor, one of my favorites at RIT hands down!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	1	Electrical Engineering		4	2	3	4	1104734	5/11/06	Doesn't give examples, reads out of the handouts, assigns homework without giving you the background for it, same with the labs, he gives practice exams before the test that are almost identical to the actual tests though, not very helpful in office hours, drops some of the lower homework grades, lets you makeup a question from each test at final
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering		4	4	4	2	1104734	12/5/04	Pretty dry teacher...But he loves guns n' roses and is pretty funny. Let's you retake tests that you didn't do well on and if you put some effort into his class you can easily get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering	732	2	5	4	NULL	1104734	2/7/04	Dorin is always willing to help if you ask. However, he gets mad when he gets no questions until the day before the project is due, and 1834879134987 questions on the last day. Start your projects and ask questions early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	0	Electrical Engineering	650	1	1	2	4	1104734	11/10/12	Mr.Patru's teaches so fast. You always need to have a book and pen. His labwork is so intense that if you don't know anything about VHDL coding please don't take this course.You are expected to do coding on your own.He conducts open book exams which is a "big trap".He always makes fun of our questions. Never cooperated during office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering	347	1	3	4	1	1104734	4/3/12	Labs are extremely difficult, especially if you fall behind. homework is okay, but easy if you go to office hours. He is very intimidating (makes fun of questions in class), but if you take time to seek his help one on one, he is very helpful and knowledgable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	0	Electrical Engineering		1	2	2	1	1104734	11/15/11	Patru is one of the meanest professors in the EE department, he doesnt help at all, he in fact makes fun of your questions and though he is a good lecturer, he is unwilling to help you outside of his class. Gives a bad attitude to most students, so I highly recommend avoid him at all cost. And oh, it is not an easy A, so study HARD!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	5	5	1104734	5/2/05	You have to try to fail. Gives practice tests days ahead that are the real test verbatim except for a few numeric changes, and lets you redo problems you missed. Easy homeworks, decent labs, easy grader. Somewhat hard material so be careful because the last weeks suck, even with him. Very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dorin Patru	3.5	1	Electrical Engineering		3	3	2	NULL	1104734	3/1/04	Doenst know VHDL...got screwed in his course...bcoz he doesnt teach anything relevant...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Pedersen	5.0	2	Computer Science	361	4	5	5	5	608939	5/7/09	Awesome guy, probably the best of the 361 professors. Grades fairly, very willing to help, and is very passionate about SE. Plus he's cool to talk with. If you have the chance, get into his section.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Pelz	3.5	2	Imaging Science		1	4	3	4	1366473	2/6/11	Lots of information to absorb. Tests are hard, especially if you have trouble absorbing lecture material. Gives good notes and teaches well, but the topic of the class is not easy. Great teacher, bad class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Pennell	1.5	0	Design		3	1	2	1	1628799	10/20/11	LITERALLY THE WORST WAY TO LEARN SOLIDWORKS. First day comes in and told us all he had never taught before. Didn't even have to tell us because we could all tell by the way he was sweating bullets. Gets annoyed that we are don't already know the program. Wastes time by not explaining things correctly the first time.Messes up & confuses the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Peres	3.6	2	Communication		3	4	4	4	315480	4/27/09	Great Professor to have. Projects relate to what we are studying and if you have any questions you can ask him. He is always around and helpful to students. For the first two quarters you need to really take notes because the exams are hard, especially winter quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Peres	3.6	2	Communication	201	2	5	4	5	315480	11/18/08	Very intelligent person; highly recommed taking his microscopy courses. Sometimes theories can be repetitive, but overall conceptual content extremely relevant to "real-world" experiences. :OD [One of my favorite professors at RIT]

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Peres	3.6	0	Communication		4	2	2	5	315480	4/9/09	Repeats himself ALL the time. I have taken several classes with him and he repeats assignments that haven't been updated since 1970. He is the chair of a major that has been completely fabricated by him and barely exists in the real world. Don't waste your time or money.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Peres	3.6	0	Communication		2	3	1	5	315480	10/25/06	Strange guy. He is kind of hard to follow sometimes but if you ask questions he can be helpful. He knows about the program more than anyone so he can be useful. Class is alot of hard work and you need to pay sooo much attention to detail. very technical

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Perez-Galluccio	4.7	2	Spanish	560	5	5	5	4	1253765	11/16/09	The best Spanish teacher ever! I wish he taught all the Spanish classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Perez-Galluccio	4.7	2	Spanish	560	4	5	4	3	1253765	2/9/09	He was a fabulous teacher! He made class fun and easy. Great sense of humor. I would Highly recommend him to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Perez-Galluccio	4.7	2	Spanish		4	4	5	5	1253765	9/27/09	Awesome professor. Wants you to learn. Really laid back. Corrects your mistakes kindly. Makes class interactive and listening. Cool guy to talk to. Good personality. Fun class. Work is not too bad. More project than busy work. Pick up vocab easily. You should take Spanish for technology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Valerie Perotti	1.0	0	Business		2	1	1	4	962980	11/10/08	Her grading methods were purely based on her own judgment, which meant that if she didn't like you, your grades would show. Even went so far as to not proofread my paper, although she did proofread other students' papers (which were sent after mine!!). Seriously! She seems nice, but DONT BE FOOLED!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		3	5	5	3	249526	3/1/12	Had him for Writing Seminar, really awesome guy. He is very helpful and clear about his assignments, as a professor he really makes you care about your writing, though the course material was rather dull he always found a way to make it interesting, work is required though! (I had several small essays myself, 7.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		3	5	5	2	249526	10/29/07	Awesome teacher!!!! I had him for writing seminar. His classes are truly seminars, it is very easy to get involved within the discussion! If your looking for a class that discusses writing methods and writing 10 page "essays" this is not for you. This class is based off of listening in class and writing an effective essay on your opinion to a readi
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		4	4	4	5	249526	5/18/07	He is very interesting and knowledgeable. His in class discussions can be hilarious but you still learn a lot. He's not afraid to speak his mind and he is always willing to answer questions. Show up to class do your homework and you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		5	5	5	3	249526	5/19/06	Great professor. Lectures were informative and engaging. He is hilarious too. He really does give you every opportunity to do well, you have to just not care to do poorly in his class. I am glad i had him, he was awesome.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		3	4	4	1	249526	10/25/04	Well I was spoiled by my Writing at Lit 1 professor, he is a good teacher in general, and he does not make the research paper required for all Wrining and Lit 2 people to be about english, but rather a current issue, b/c we are not English majors. Overall a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English	101	4	5	5	NULL	249526	4/29/04	The best English teacher on campus. Makes stitting threw two hours of English, well, not fun, but at least bareable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English	227	3	5	5	5	249526	4/22/10	The BEST ever! You would have to work, but he will try to help you if you want. Very clear prof. Would highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		3	4	5	2	249526	6/25/07	Very helpful, hilarious guy. Fun classes with lots of discussion time. Topics are a little boring sometimes, but he gets the ball rolling with his humor. Not very hard at all as long as you attend class and do homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		2	4	5	3	249526	5/24/06	Great guy, morbid sense of humor... and really gets your grades posted fast!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		5	5	5	1	249526	12/2/04	Had him for both Lit classes. He is easy plus you can rewrite one of the essays. Show up to class makes it very interesting. Take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English		4	5	5	1	249526	10/20/04	writ/lit class was out of 100 total points but fairly easy grader. Either that or he just taught me well. also makes class fun to be in
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Perry	4.6	2	English	205	2	5	5	NULL	249526	10/31/03	best lit teacher on campus
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	3	568275	11/20/12	take all the notes. ALL THE NOTES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology		3	1	3	1	568275	5/13/12	A very frustrating professor who does not make use of technology at all. He does not use mycourses at all. He uses an overhead projector instead of powerpoint slides. He uses documents, cases, examples, etc that are over 10 years old. He refuses to answer any email you send him. He does not post office hours on his syllabus. He repeats the same stories over and over. He does not specify when assignments are due. He grades rather fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	2	Information Technology		4	4	3	3	568275	11/9/11	Class is required for IT majors. Not terribly interesting information. He likes to tell stories and talk about himself. He doesn't post the slides, so take notes. Not a whole lot of work. All in all, not a terrible guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	1	568275	4/25/11	Simply the most horrible professor at RIT. Deserved to be kicked out. Does not care about your education, extremely lazy! Again extremely lazy.Does not reply to emails, will give you useless articles to read from 1980, and sits there talks about simply nothing. I'll take 100 programming courses before I take another class with this guy. Shame on RI
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	5	568275	4/14/10	Cool guy during lecture but that is about the only positive. Does not use myCourses at all so you have no idea what is going on at all during the quarter. The tests are impossible. He also likes to go on side rants and boast about how he drives Porsche's and BMW's. I'd avoid this guy in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	3	568275	10/23/05	Very easy class, and he is an easy going guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology	455	4	1	3	3	568275	11/10/12	Story time with Ron, aka Needs Assessment and Tech Transfer are pretty tedious classes clearly created just to fill curriculum and to round out some of the GCCIS types that lack common sense. Anyone in there obviously has to take it as a required course so it's not like you can avoid it. Grade-wise it's not bad if you put in the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	2	Information Technology	455	3	3	5	1	568275	3/29/12	He was very boring. Test are straight from the powerpoints BUT does not post them online. You have to copy every slide in your notes, so bring a computer. Writing assignments/projects are easy but midterm/tests are another story.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	1	Information Technology	460	4	2	4	1	568275	10/25/11	He does not post slides so write everything he says down. It WILL show up on the final. He mostly just reads his own powerpoints or gives you an article then reads it to you, which is enough to put you to sleep. Just try to have common sense and mix that in with his notes, and you have a good thesis for the test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	3	568275	3/10/11	He doesn't give you any materials and asks extremely specific questions on tests and gives no partial credit. Took two weeks to respond to e-mail and he's never in his office. He sometimes sits there and doesn't say anything for ten minutes. Avoid him for Tech Transfer because many better teachers exist, Rick Scott for example.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Perry	2.5	0	Information Technology	460	1	1	1	3	568275	2/22/10	Horrible teacher, took him for freshmen sem was easy, but for Tech transfer he's horrible! It's finals week, the only grade I've seen was the POP MIDTERM. Doesn't use mycourses, doesn't hand ANYTHING useful out, just reads his ppts and the tests are impossible. Has story time(he hands you an article then reads it to you) doesn't respond to email
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business	101	3	5	4	5	1043789	10/14/12	Very clear and knowledgeable about the subject matter he teaches. Had as an adjunct at MCC from RIT. Very grateful to have the opportunity to take classes with him. He is reasonable and down to earth. Expectations are very reasonable of his college level students. Very impressed. Look forward to future opportunities to learn from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business		3	5	5	4	1043789	10/20/11	For someone like me who has no prior experience with Excel or other computer programs, I was utterly lost for the first 2 weeks. I go in his office every week, no I am not kidding. Every week, then I passed with an A!!! Just go to his office and he will help you with no problem. TIP: Just stay on his good side. Haha. Sit on the front row, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business	804	4	4	4	4	1043789	2/1/10	I took orientation to business, management, and BSA. Overall, he's good but doesn't like waiting. Gives real-world business examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business		3	5	4	5	1043789	5/13/08	Took three business classes with him, a lot of fun and hard challenges. Even though, he gave a lot of interesting examples and fun class working with him. Always available outside of class too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business	101	4	5	5	4	1043789	10/21/11	If you do your homework (30 min to 1 hour per week), attend the classes, give participation in discussion, you will get A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business	101	5	5	5	1	1043789	5/20/10	awesome teacher, very knowledgable I learned alot from him, if you give him the resoect he will do the same to you and do whatever he can to help you succeed, I would suggest more people to take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	0	Business	804	1	1	1	1	1043789	1/26/10	He's disrespectful and devious man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Pfuntner	4.1	2	Business		3	4	3	4	1043789	10/26/07	Mark is a pretty cool professor. The class isn't that hard if you just show up and do your assignments and you should just do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Phillips	3.3	2	Engineering		4	4	3	5	360192	2/14/12	I've had him for several biomed eng courses. He has a very monotone that puts you to sleep, and sometime he rambles a bit. But he knows his stuff and definitely cares about the students he's teaching. If you don't understand something ask him. Very few graded assignments, which wasn't always good, but atleast they didn't take up a lot of time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Phillips	3.3	2	Engineering		3	4	4	5	360192	2/6/07	Pretty decent teacher. Talks in a bit of a monotone and tends to teach the material after the homework on that topic has been turned in. Otherwise with a little work you can get an A in the class no problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Phillips	3.3	1	Engineering		2	1	4	NULL	360192	3/1/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Phillips	3.3	1	Engineering		3	4	2	4	360192	4/1/10	Tends to ramble. Answers can be very cryptic at times, not really getting at the point. Besides that, very approachable, innovative course structure (emphasis on self reliance, not laundry list assignments, not much HW). Always entertains questions gladly and knows his stuff. But don't dare eat in has class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Phillips	3.3	2	Engineering		3	4	3	5	360192	6/29/05	Soft-spoken, easy going. Presents well, even on tough material. Often talks way past 50 minutes; try not to schedule a class right after his. Likes to ask questions in class, and if you have no idea he'll concentrate on you. Very helpful outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Peden	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	2	954683	10/24/11	great juggling class, no textbook,lots of fun. the professor is a great guy, very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Peden	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	2	954683	2/5/08	This guy is amazing. It doesn't matter if you can or can't juggle, he teaches all skill levels. You'd think 10 classes of juggling would get boring-- but he keeps it interesting with videos, tricks, and new props. Easy grade as long as you show up and are enthusiastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Peden	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	954683	8/16/10	He's really awesome. This class is amazingly fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Peden	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	954683	1/31/07	Jeff is a great guy. You don't need to be able to juggle by the end of class to pass. As long as you show up most of the time and try and mostly have fun, you will pass. Jeff lets you experiment with all kinds of props, so there is something in the class for jugglers of all levels. I highly reccomend this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	227	5	5	5	1	1189853	1/30/12	He is awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1189853	11/23/11	Wonderful professor who has helped me tremendously with my writing. His essays are interrelated with the readings so that nothing is per say "useless". Otherwise he is very funny (as well as fun) and down to Earth. He'll move around assignment's due dates to help you out. If you have to take writing seminar definitely try and schedule it with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	319	4	5	5	5	1189853	11/17/11	Tons of fun. Loves comic books, literature, video games, and everything you care about. He made me feel right at home in his class. If you're a geek like I am, then this class will suit you to a T. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1189853	1/25/11	Great professor that is really into the material he teaches, if you need a liberal arts class and are into comic books, take this class with Bobby!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	1	1189853	10/27/10	Easily the funniest professor i have had. Somehow managed to make writing fun and easy. Take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	502	2	5	5	5	1189853	4/9/10	Have him for an 8 am class, and I can honestly say that I look forward to this class every morning. He is a very entertaining speaker, and I love his accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	5	5	5	2	1189853	10/27/09	Good teacher :) Very funny! If you get a chance to take his class- Do it!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	502	2	5	3	5	1189853	3/10/09	Extremely smart professor. Treats students with respect. Really great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	502	3	5	4	5	1189853	3/2/09	I took Professor Pelphrey for the Graphic Novel class, and it was amazing. This is the first class I actually read every book. He teaches by lectures, stories, and class discussions. You have three papers, and that it's it. TAKE IT, and enjoy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	1	Freshman Year Experience		3	2	4	3	1189853	11/1/08	I have Bobby for Writing Seminar, and I really appreciate the fact that he goes out of his way to make sure his students are learning. It is nice to know that at atleast one of my professors knows my name--see you next quarter, Bobby!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	4	1189853	11/28/11	I use to hate writing until I had professor pelphrey, he is hilarious and goes on tangents a lot, probably my favorite professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		3	5	5	5	1189853	11/23/11	The guy who wrote the negative review is a loser; pelphrey was organized; his syllabus and due dates are all there; he post grades and papers electronically, and he is flexible. The guy is amazing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	227	3	5	5	2	1189853	11/15/11	Professor Pelphrey is a great teacher. He made writing a bit more enjoyable for me. I even had him at 8am and he is very energetic and down to earth. He is a funny guy and has a southern accent. If you enjoy writing, just a little bit, and need a LA course try to get him. He makes everything enjoyable to learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	319	3	3	5	5	1189853	11/21/10	Okay guy. Hated the class, though. Unless you're really into finding meaning in art, don't take this class. I was bored out of my mind staring at poorly drawn ant-eater-looking mice reading Maus. Probably good for writing sem, but unless you're really into visual art, I wouldn't recommend taking graphic novel
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	4	4	5	3	1189853	10/22/10	Great teacher who makes us laugh a lot. Lets us leave early a lot. Assignments are boring though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	1189853	1/28/10	Best teacher ever. His jokes were hilarious and he was a character as well as a great teacher. I really improved as a writer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		4	4	4	1	1189853	5/13/09	Love him! He's hilarious if you really listen to the stuff that comes out of his mouth. You will improve as a writer too, he gives you tons of opportunities to correct papers before turning them in so there's no reason you can't get a good grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	502	3	4	4	4	1189853	3/6/09	The King of Witty One-Liners. I loved this class. You learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	4	1	1189853	1/22/09	Bobby is a great professor and a great person. He is very funny, easygoing, and down-to-earth. He actually made FYE fun. You Rock Bobby!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	5	5	5	2	1189853	11/1/08	He really makes FYE fun - as crazy as it sounds, it's true. I'm taking another one of this classes next quarter, partly because it's interesting, partly because he's teaching it! Woo Bobby!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bobby Pelphrey	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	4	3	1189853	10/22/08	Very funny guy. He actually makes FYE fun (if you can imagine that!). There is little homwework and he is a very fair and generous grader. You're awesome Bobby!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	3	4	4	402220	2/8/13	Took Vector Imaging with her (basic Illustrator class.) Grades pretty fairly. Moves pretty quickly. Knowledge of the subject not the best, as shown through personal examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	0	Fine Arts		1	1	3	3	402220	10/19/10	doesnt grade on effort, grades on ability, even than plays favorites.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	402220	2/2/10	By far the best professor I've had I learned more than in any other class. She was crystal clear on what she wanted and if you did that you get an A. Her work is exceptional and is willing to help everyone succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	402220	3/19/08	Magz is exceptional. I love her class and her positive attitude. She is not too easy and not too difficult... I love her! <3
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		2	4	3	5	402220	2/2/07	I have to disagree with the last comment -- Pence is certainly not EASY, but she will certainly make you a better artist. You really have to be trying in her classes, but if you put the effort in, it's certainly possible to get an A. The problem I had with her was that she's pretty boring. And her projects are even more boring than she is.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	3	402220	11/2/11	She may seem dry and little boring at first, but once you warm up to her she's extremely helpful. She s patient and corrects you till you get it right. You'd have to work hard in her class and her work is amazing so she knows what she's talking about. Great class for a foundation and if you're trying to sharpen your artistic skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	4	402220	3/4/10	Cared a lot about the students. The only class I enjoyed out of my foundation courses. If you try hard you will get an A. Also lets you do re-dos to improve your grade. Great Prof.!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	0	Fine Arts		2	3	1	4	402220	4/10/08	*Grading is very subjective which could mean the 7-8 hours you put into your project will only produce a c. *Told the entire class that the art quality was "terrible" wasn't really the best approach to getting a point across. *Is a part time professor and has experience in the art world *Lecture can be very boring unless your really into art.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	3	402220	2/21/07	She was very nit-picky and gave lower grades to everyone then they deserved. I never saw her smile, she was very boring and dry, and she created an intense working atmosphere. I would not recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Margaret Pence	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	402220	10/28/05	If you did the work, the class was an easy A. She was my fav teacher of all the teachers I've had in foundations.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1533898	3/10/12	Overall Mr. Pennington was a great teacher. He was very clear with teaching the material, and made the class fun by joking and having corky stories to explain the math concepts (wheely willy). I would definitely recommend him for your class. Also, he was always willing to help if I didn't understand a math concept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	2	Mathematics	206	4	4	3	2	1533898	11/12/11	Daily quizzes instead of collecting homework and taking attendance. His constant math puns are groan worthy. But overall nice guy and is readily available to help before class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	5	1533898	3/9/11	This professor is very confused. He just keep off the topic about the math joke then back to the track. It really confused. I strong recommended to not taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	4	1533898	1/24/11	This teacher is a nice guy, good to talk with but the discrete math is hard for me especially math is not my thing. The only thing it will pull my grade down is 10 minute quizzes every time you show up, I would need an extra time than just 10 minutes maximum. If math is your passion, worth to have him but watch your grade on MyCourses frequently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	1533898	2/22/12	He is pretty good teacher. If you attend classes and keep up with the class. The class can be easy. But if you miss class often or does not go see tutor, the class can be a nightmare for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	1	1533898	10/27/11	Cool Guy but hard teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Pennington	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	1533898	2/14/11	Good professor...he make sure students understand the material. If not, makes himself available before class. He give 5 minutes quizzes at the beginning of every class. You come to class, do the homework, you will pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Melvin Perez-Cedano	1.5	0	Computer Science	350	1	1	2	5	1412883	2/28/10	Very nice guy but should not be teaching second years or higher. He rarely understood the projects we were assigned to do and therefore, if you needed help, he had no idea how to fix your problem. His grading was very harsh and it is impossible to get 100%. One time I only lost points because I decided to use brackets on a single line if statement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	5	887767	2/12/13	Professor Perez-Hardy is the head of her department and has been a Professor at RIT for decades. I had her for Network Fundamentals, and in my opinion she was a great professor. She has had so much experience in her field that she brings a lot to lectures and has a way of explaining difficult concepts well. I would recommend her highly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology		4	1	1	4	887767	11/6/09	Well as you probably see in every other rating, this lady is useless as a teacher. Mandatory attendance even when she was an hour late for her final. Us 80 kids just sitting and waiting. When she got in, she somehow blamed us. She is very disorganized and teaches old material. Treats you like you are incompetent in teaching. Overall, awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology		5	1	2	1	887767	5/25/09	Very late to return assignments--was even late to her own final, won't correspond by email just by discussion board so the whole class can see even the most private of matters, out of the sector so long that much of what she teaches is out of date to the point of being just plain wrong. She might be a OK admin, but NO good teacher, DON'T recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	351	2	1	2	4	887767	11/15/08	She is the worst professor I've ever had. She didn't grade the work (labs, HW, Attendance(?)) until well after the final was over. She is very disorganized, and is late for class often (later than me).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	351	2	1	1	1	887767	11/3/08	Pretty poor teacher. She's really boring and my main irk was that the week before finals week, I still do not have any of the grades for any of my labs. That, and she doesn't accept hardcopies of papers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	3	887767	11/6/07	what can be said, that has not been said already? stay away from her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology		2	3	1	2	887767	11/29/06	She's a stern teacher but the lecture part is horrible. I mean, I barely understood most of the lecture, and she wouldn't hand out the presentation slide. Midterm and Final Exam is just **** (the written part)- like covering one chapter for the whole midterm and final exam. Do I recommend her? No.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	342	1	1	1	4	887767	11/14/06	If I followed the Code of Bushido, I would have to go kill her because she has dishonored me so. I would reather shoot myself in the foot than ever take a class with her again. Loves IBM and Token-Ring and hates ethernet with a bittersweet passion. 7 Labs, 7 Days you didn't know what happen. NEVER NEVER NEVER take a class with this person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	515	2	2	2	5	887767	11/10/11	HORRIBLE!!! Try to avoid her as a professor. Good person & department chair but lacks the teaching skills.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	5	887767	1/27/09	Great administrator. Bad Teacher. Take her course as a last resort, consider putting off the course until the next quarter if you have to, it's not worth the effort to tolerate her 'teaching' process.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	2	Information Technology	351	2	3	4	2	887767	11/7/08	Had her for Network Fundamentals (351). Nice lady, knows a lot about networking, but really too busy to teach this class. Don't expect any grades back till finals week! She's really, really terra-bad at organization or consistency and is forgetful. If you know a lot about networking you'll be fine, else I'd suggest another prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	342	1	1	1	2	887767	6/11/08	I have had Sylvia for two networking classes now. In both of them she used outdated material and labs from previous years. She would take ages to hand back any assignments. In one class she claimed we would be able to redo all our labs for improved grades but she did not return them until AFTER the final. DO NOT take a class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	515	3	1	2	3	887767	11/5/07	Professor cannot return assignments in a timely fashion. For instance, labs passed in Week 2 of class were not returned as of Week 9 (and at RIT quarters are only 10 weeks long). Whereas labs are 25% of your grade and a big part of the learning, taking a class with this professor is a large gamble.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	1	Information Technology	342	2	4	1	3	887767	11/20/06	If Fischer-Price made kintergarden-level networking kits you'd learn more there. Expect to be treated like you are in third grade. Course materials are light years out of date. Grades will be weeks late. Read the book for the exams - the lectures will teach nothing relevant. She's too busy being dept head to do any teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sylvia Perez-Hardy	1.7	0	Information Technology	342	1	1	1	5	887767	9/6/06	She treats the class like a first grade class. Assigned seats and partners, even nametags that she printed out so we would know where to sit. DO NOT take her, she is awful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	2	Business	312	4	5	5	5	130611	3/7/12	Building A Web Biz - LOVED him as a Prof. Lectures were never boring, not much required reading, but gave loads of optional readings that I learned a TON from. Highly encouraged student to student interactions, was open to suggestions. Gave challenging assignments, but willing to go above and beyond ensure you have the answers you need. HIGHLY REC!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	2	Business		4	4	3	5	130611	4/10/11	Take Dr. P, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	0	Business		4	1	2	3	130611	3/2/09	I was never so lost as during his class. Maybe he knows the stuff but does not know how to teach it (self teaching). There is no need to take this class, if u r gonna teach by means of online tutorials...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	0	Business	101	4	1	2	3	130611	4/26/08	Everything taught was irrelivant, made things up as he went and you can definately tell. never recieved grades or had things handed back

Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	0	Business		2	1	1	1	130611	11/21/11	Never gave grades back. Learned nothing useful. Completely pointless class. There is basically no work in the class though and if he likes you it's an easy grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	2	Business		4	5	5	5	130611	1/26/11	An absolutely wonderful professor. He facilitates an environment for real student learning with discussion and relevant group work. He lets students take the wheel instead of straight, boring lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	2	Business	860	5	5	5	1	130611	12/5/08	Great prof. Put on extra study sessions so we could pass the exams. Would take another class in a heart beat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Victor Perotti	3.6	2	Business		4	5	5	4	130611	2/6/06	Uses in class example programs and hands-on activities. His first priority is that you understand and can apply the material. Assigned a number of short programming assignments and a mid-term and final. Excellent professor, would highly recommend.

Had her for endocrinology, although the material is hard, she makes it manageable & is an easy grader. Lecture is not mandatory, but recitation is. 2 in class exams (all writing no mult. choice), one take home paper dissection, and a final. 20% of your grade comes from going to recitation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		4	5	3	4	1190911	11/15/11	Took Perry for Cell Bio and Endocrinology..excellent professor. Take advantage of her office hours and be sure to ask questions. She's great with students, especially deaf students. She can finger spell and sign some things and is very willing to learn! LOVE her classes, look forward to taking Human Development with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	425	2	5	5	5	1190911	1/24/11	BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! I took her cell bio and endocrinology classes and loved both of them. She is extremely helpful, kind, and engaging. She is one of the few professors who actually cares about her students, and will take the time to get to know you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	1190911	2/25/10	Dr. Perry is a great professor! She is such a great person as well. She explains concepts in a way that I've never come across before, and makes it easy to understand. She is always more than willing to help anyone with anything (whether it's class-related or not). Still remembers me and says hi in passing! Can't say enough good things about her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	1190911	9/2/09	Even if you're not a Bio major, take a class with her. She's an awesome advisor and actually there to help you. AWESOMEAWESOMEAWESOME.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		4	5	5	5	1190911	2/25/09	Extremely helpful, and creates interest in the subject. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	311	4	5	5	1	1190911	1/21/09	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	425	2	5	5	3	1190911	2/29/12	I LOVE Dr. Perry. She really cares about her students, she loves teaching, and she'll make sure you'll know what you need to know. The only thing I don't like is her tests are all handwritten, and it's like taking a 2 hour test, but only having one hour to do it, so you really have to know your stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	425	3	5	4	5	1190911	9/14/11	Take any and every class that you can with Dr. Perry. Although rumors go around that she is an "easy" professor, the subjects that she teaches are not. You will need to study because the subject matter can be challenging. But she is a very relaxed and kind-hearted person. I've taken a bunch of her classes. Best professor I ever had. Ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		4	4	4	4	1190911	4/11/10	She is a very sweet lady and she makes things so much easier to understand. She is genuinely concerned about the students and wants to make sure that we understand the information. I strongly recommend her for Cell Biology over Wright. Go Perry!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		4	5	5	4	1190911	10/20/09	Very sweet lady. She really is interested in helping you and wants you to achieve. Very clear lessons. She provides study guides before exams which you SHOULD review. Take her for Cell Bio! I'm definitely going to take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	311	3	5	5	3	1190911	4/9/09	Dr. Perry is an excellent professor. Understands what it means to be a student and the hardship that comes with it. Will always help you out when you need it. I highly recommend her over Dr. Wright for Cell Biology. She also teaches other Special Topics classes that are very interesting and highly informational.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology		2	5	5	5	1190911	2/24/09	She is all around very helpful, class format is more of an informal slide based discussion/lecture. Tests were challenging, but attending class really helped. HIGHLY recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Perry	4.7	2	Biology	550	5	4	5	4	1190911	10/24/08	Very nice woman. She is a little neuortic and silly at times but is very interested in teaching students what we are interested in. Too worried about what students think about her, so kind of on the edge type of person. Overall the class was kind of a joke. Too easy, and didn't learn much. Too much unrelated discussion. Overall ok teacher, not best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	1	Imaging Science	123	4	3	3	4	1041070	1/29/10	Stefan is a sweet and classy guy. Lectures can get very boring very fast, but critiques/assignments make up for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	2	Imaging Science		4	4	3	4	1041070	5/7/08	Young and Knowledgeable, and one hot stud.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	2	Imaging Science		3	5	4	4	1041070	2/13/08	Stefan was extremely helpful, very easy to talk to. He is very understanding and fair grader. If you turn in crappy assignments, you'll get crappy grades. He knows what he is talking about, I learned a lot in this class. His lectures can be pretty dry, but informative. Be prepared for lots of handouts. So far my favorite professor this year.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	2	Imaging Science		2	5	4	5	1041070	10/21/07	one of the best professors i've had so far; extremely helpful in class; a bit flaky at times with his explanations of his assignments and his critiques, but overall a great guy. too bad he's just an adjunct prof, he's awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	2	Imaging Science	123	4	5	5	5	1041070	10/5/08	awesome teacher! you'll learn a lot and you'll have a great time. a lot of work but so worth it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	5	1041070	4/28/08	love stefan! great teacher, great guy. he's got a good sense of humor but he's serious about photography and you'll learn a LOT. lots of assignments and you'll always be working but the class is lots of fun. highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stefan Petranek	3.9	0	Imaging Science	300	2	2	2	2	1041070	1/9/08	Very, very boring. Lectures on and on about things and tries to squeeze too much into 10 weeks. I would NOT recommend this teacher at all. Have never heard of one student who had him and liked it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Phelps	3.9	0	Information Technology		5	1	3	3	854130	3/10/13	Didn't ever seem to care about actually preparing students for jobs in the games industry. Certain classes like Operating Systems, Linear Algebra, and really anything about performance is ignored for web classes. This is great for a short term job at a social games company, but crippling over the long term, especially the AAA world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Phelps	3.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	854130	11/13/07	Freshman seminar itself is a sort of lame class. However, Andy made it somewhat useful to the new GD&D students by having us compare games. As far as Andy goes, though, there's not much to say other than that he's amazing. If you want to know something about the game industry and getting into it, he knows and he is willing to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Phelps	3.9	2	Information Technology	123	4	4	4	4	854130	2/5/13	Pretty much the greatest thing to exist, aside from applesauce.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Phelps	3.9	2	Information Technology	102	5	4	5	3	854130	11/12/07	Freshman Seminar was awesome. We talked about boring topics such as registration, but also talked and compared games. I think this class will prove very useful when I get into hardcore game design. Show up, and you get an A basically
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gian Paul Piane	2.8	2	Fine Arts	101	5	5	4	4	819847	10/23/11	Gian Paul is very helpful and informative. I learned a lot about woodwork and you will receive an A as long as you work consistantly in class and show interest in the class. He's a fun guy to talk to and easy to get along with. I highly reccomend him and look forward to taking another one of his classes someday.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gian Paul Piane	2.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	2	819847	3/13/06	Doesn't tell you what he WANTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Piccione	1.4	0	Business	760	2	1	1	4	424250	2/27/07	bad bad bad...... follows some old edition of the book. His notes all over the place. Talks way to fast for taking notes. Does not care if students learn, but cares when the class will be out. He should not be teaching Grad classes or any classes in that matter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Piccione	1.4	1	Business	340	3	3	2	5	424250	12/2/04	Exams are hard. Lectures suck. He is all over the place. Not very helpful. Doesnt care if students learn or not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Piccione	1.4	0	Business		2	1	1	3	424250	1/13/05	he only knows how to praise himself
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Piccione	1.4	0	Business		1	1	1	NULL	424250	6/16/04	So hard. He is all over the place in his lectures, and you can't gather anything from them. The book is really hard to understand as well. Horrible professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Pierce	2.5	2	Physics		3	4	4	3	1690045	3/8/13	He's a tad quirky, but in the good way. He is a good teacher and will explain the information to you thoroughly and work with you individually and with your group during class time to help you understand. He's helpful with any questions you have, but I learned more of the SI in the class than him. He's a good teacher, but nothing great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Pierce	2.5	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	1690045	3/8/12	Doesn't seem to understand the point of a lecture. He gives a random history lesson that is barely related and then expects students to do the hardest problems in the workbook. The TA for the class had to go to each table and pretty much teach them how to do each problem. His quizzes are impossible and very rarely relate to what we've been doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Pierce	2.5	1	Physics		3	2	3	1	1690045	5/21/12	really easy grader, but you'll need it because his lectures aren't entirely clear. sometimes it doesn't even seem like there's a point to the lecture for that day
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology	330	5	5	5	1	1492972	11/1/12	Joe is an awesome teacher. The assignments are reasonable and directly apply what you learn. The 'Homework' is usually an extension of the in class stuff but with a little more tacked on. Office hours are insane, he is always there to help you. Projects are very applicable to what you learned and are very fun and easy to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology	210	4	5	5	4	1492972	5/3/12	Helpful, knowledgeable, and always listens and helps u. also quite helpful in office hours
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1492972	11/18/11	One of the best profs at RIT. Always willing to give help when needed and genuinely cares for his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	1492972	4/28/11	A treasure to GCCIS amazing teacher really helpful, approachable and all around great guy. challeges you but with appropriate prep. amazing. TAKE HIS CLASSES WHENEVER THEY ARE AVAILABLE YOU WON"T REGRET IT!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	1492972	4/17/11	Awesome teacher. Extremely helpful and a very nice guy, I highly recommend him. The only downside is he speaks quietly, just sit in the front of the class and you'll have no problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	5	1492972	10/17/12	Awesome guy, very kind and fun to learn with. One of the best you can have to teach you. Would recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	1492972	11/29/11	He is incredibly clear. Is very willing to help and knowledgeable. When he is helping you his entire attention is on you and he will never make you feel bad for not being where everyone else is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1492972	5/13/11	Awesome professor. Grades fairly and easily. You will learn a ton from this professor. Very helpful and available outside of class. He is a recent graduate of RIT as well, so he can relate to being a student here. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	1492972	4/24/11	Fantastic teacher. Really passionate about the things he's teaching, always willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Pietruch	4.9	2	Information Technology	330	4	5	5	4	1492972	1/31/11	Very helpful and easy professor. Grades fairly and will work with you if you have any problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dominique Piot	2.0	0	Information Technology		4	2	2	1	1142595	11/7/08	He's a very easy teacher to take. Just a forewarning that Needs Assessment is a boring class and a complete waste of time so the material's dry. He has trouble getting the point across sometimes and it's hard to know exactly what he wants on projects/exams. Midterm and final were super easy. Mixed feelings on this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Policano	1.8	1	Graphic Arts	342	2	2	3	1	1484618	7/23/11	Bad Communication, wouldn't recommen but if you like your prof. to Laugh alot and expect you to learn his way rather than simple ways like other prof.'s then take him. If not then don't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Policano	1.8	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	1	1	1484618	10/19/10	Don't take him!!!! Terrible and mean, unclear directions, avoid him at all costs! Very offensive. If you're stuck with him, just try not to get him mad and you'll be okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		2	5	5	4	1528083	11/18/11	I appreciated the feedback on all the home work assignments and tests. Good, patient Professor overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	0	Electrical Engineering	362	3	2	2	2	1528083	7/6/11	she does not explain any class material. She copies down all her notes on a board, and does not explain anything. you have to read everything from book. She is a tough lab grader, and was not really helpful during her office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	301	3	5	4	3	1528083	5/19/11	In all Honesty it was great having this professor. Class was small so there was always room for questions. Cares for her students. Always willing to help. She would stay after class to keep instructing students. Has a sense of humor. It was a relatively fair class. If you do the work your guaranteed a high B or A.Serious about being serious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	301	3	5	4	3	1528083	5/12/11	she was a pretty cool teacher.. the only thing I really didnt like about her was how she called on people randomly in class. she teachers clearly and very helpful. labs are pretty tedious but she helps alot. also the quizzes and homework arent bad at all and her test are pretty cool
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		2	4	4	5	1528083	4/7/11	Good professor overall. Quizzes and Tests based on homework and in class problems. Tough Grader on labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		2	3	4	4	1528083	8/29/11	Time requirement for coursework was unreasonable. Homework assignments were lengthy and complicated, but similar in nature to exam material and class concepts and lectures. Good class for traditional students as part of a pipeline, not so much for adult learners looking to expand skill set.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	301	1	4	5	4	1528083	5/19/11	Organized and clear in what she expects from you. There's A LOT of WORK but just do the homeowrk, quizzes come right from it. Prof Polo gives a review of general exam topics beforehand and there were no surprises. Very helpful during office hours. Class was fun, I really liked her understated humor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering		1	5	5	5	1528083	5/17/11	outstanding!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	301	3	5	4	3	1528083	5/12/11	she was a pretty cool teacher.. the only thing I really didnt like about her was how she called on people randomly in class. she teachers clearly and very helpful. labs are pretty tedious but she helps alot. also the quizzes and homework arent bad at all and her test are pretty fair. i recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Francesca Polo	4.1	2	Electrical Engineering	361	3	4	3	3	1528083	1/26/11	Might not be the best professor at answering questions, but care for her students to succeed and do well. The material and homework are manageable. Exams are fair, should be easy if you actually study the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	405	5	5	5	4	956934	11/10/11	Great professor. Really knows her stuff. Her personality keeps class a little more interesting. Pay attention, participate, and read the chapters- it will be an easy A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	1	Criminal Justice	441	2	3	3	2	956934	11/6/08	Good professor. Is very helpful when you have questions and fair about things. Does a lot of online interactions and is good to you even if you do bad on her tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	501	3	5	5	5	956934	3/4/08	Awesome! Keeps class interesting and light as muh as she can, loves to go againstte grain. Keeps you thinking, can learn a whole lot from her. Loves her students and grades fairly. Must take classes from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	5	4	956934	11/4/07	Fantastic teacher, she keeps things interesting. Class usually consists of a class discussion on a topic, very light and easy. She'll often show videos and let class end early if it's in the morning. Her tests are 50 multiple choice and 2 essay questions. Easy tests, gives out a study guide for questions and essay topics. Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	101	3	5	5	5	956934	2/8/07	Great teacher and funny she does a mixed course with online discussions, tests are multiple choice for corrections & essay for Minority groups in CJ. The corrections multiple choice was fairly easy as long as you read the text and read over the notes she provides in power point. The essay in MGCJ she lets you bring in a note card with notes on it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice	501	5	4	3	3	956934	10/28/10	Professor is at times unprofessional, and chastises students for their opinions if they do not match her very liberal views. Gets off topic, but class is an easy "A" wont deny that. you just need to bring a box of straws so that you can suck it up and get through it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	5	956934	5/11/08	I took all her classes(7?) and she is one of the best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		4	3	4	1	956934	1/28/08	had her for many classes. very funny, makes things interesting. normally get out early. uses power point, easy tests, doesn't believe in failing students. highly recommend!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Judy Porter	4.3	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	4	4	956934	8/23/07	Great Teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Poteat	2.9	0	Health Science		2	1	1	3	1723405	3/31/13	Terrible teacher. Conflicting information within documents (syllabus, course outline, etc). Teacher does not clarify adequately, is incredibly strict, and rude - displays attitude and emotion in emails and discussion posts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Poteat	2.9	2	Health Science	111	4	5	5	4	1723405	1/22/13	Just began class, she brought my stress level down and seems like an easy going and very intelligent professor. Im excited to continue learning from her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Poteat	2.9	1	Health Science		5	1	5	1	1723405	2/16/13	She is the worst professor I've had at RIT, if she happens to not like you, she will make your life a living Hell. She is the most closed-minded person I have met at RIT, she is completely unhelpful, and I actually filed a formal complaint because of her lack of professionalism and respect for me. Her class however, was very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Poteat	2.9	1	Health Science		4	2	3	1	1723405	11/9/12	Very poor teacher, class was boring. She is too strict for the joke of a class she teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Pow	5.0	2	Imaging Science	253	4	5	5	5	1689272	5/26/12	Awesome class. Definitely take it. The grade comes from how much work you put into it. It is easy to get an A if you put in a decent amount of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Pow	5.0	2	Imaging Science	253	3	5	5	5	1689272	1/26/12	He's a cool guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ray Phinney	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	3	928019	12/4/06	His background at Fisher Price is fascinating and he is very qualified to be teaching this class. He is always willing to meet with people individually, and he could not be any nicer! The classes (1,2,3) require a lot of work, but this is the foundation of your ID drawing, and he is the teacher to have!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rene Piccereto	5.0	2	Business	101	5	5	5	5	962690	10/12/10	Had him for underwater photo. Very helpful and understanding. Actually wants you to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kerri  Pierce	2.0	0	Literature	277	3	2	2	1	1795547	1/30/13	I had her for writing seminar. She was very disorganized and was constantly changing the syllabus. However she only gave 5 essays, 4 of them were 2-3 pages and the final essay was 5 pages. She is a fair grader, but don't expect her to email you back. Overall average, I would avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Piervincenzi	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	4	402100	8/1/05	Great teacher, fun class! If you have the chance to be in his class - go for it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Piervincenzi	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	NULL	402100	5/4/04	Awesome guy... definitely take his class, he's more of your friend than a teacher and definitely knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Pike	3.2	2	Accounting	212	3	5	5	5	1092284	11/16/10	He is the best professor I've ever because he's really brilliant and funny man. I never bored in this course with him. He likes to give students' bonus and care them to get excellent grades instead of good grade. How nice he is!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Pike	3.2	0	Accounting		4	1	2	1	1092284	1/14/08	Love to talk during class which would put you to sleep anytime and FAST. Quiz's easy with multiple choices, but pointless anyway. Treated this class like a high school class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Pike	3.2	1	Accounting	801	4	3	3	3	1092284	2/16/10	Not quite a hard class unless you pay attention. Bonus points for the final grade are nice but they're only free points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosalba Pisaturo	1.8	0	Spanish		5	1	2	4	1250103	8/15/12	I dreaded going to this class every week. She didn't like me and made it quite obvious. She had favorites within the first week. Yelled at us for procrastinating even though we always all had hw done on time. Advice stay away from this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosalba Pisaturo	1.8	1	Spanish		5	2	4	3	1250103	2/24/09	Decent prof. class was easy, but perhaps because I took Spanish before. only complaints are the required attendance (which is 20% of the grade by the way) and the long online homework assignments. if you have taken Spanish before, probably best to avoid this class as it gets boring real fast
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rosalba Pisaturo	1.8	0	Spanish		1	1	1	4	1250103	12/21/11	How a prestigious school gave job to this person really goes beyond my understanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wafa Polies	2.8	0	Engineering	404	1	1	1	2	1234012	7/24/09	horrible professor! stay away!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wafa Polies	2.8	0	Engineering	404	2	1	1	3	1234012	2/3/09	The RIT Civil Dept. went way downhill the day they hired her! He speaks broken English so its very hard to understand her, she is extremely vague, she piggy backs off the other prof that teaches the course so she has very little knowledge of the topic...stay away!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wafa Polies	2.8	2	Engineering	404	3	5	4	3	1234012	5/18/09	One of the greatest profs. Goes out of her way to help her students and always there for extra help and clarification. Expects a lot from her students but, do your work and you'll get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wafa Polies	2.8	2	Engineering	404	3	5	4	4	1234012	12/22/08	great prof. knows what they are doing. always there in times of need.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gabriela Popa	2.0	0	Science		2	2	1	3	66034	11/25/06	terrible, stay away if you can. obviously not her fault, but her accent is very hard to understand. still, her teaching methods just arent very effective. while she is available outside the class, which is great, she doesn't explain the material well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gabriela Popa	2.0	0	Science		3	2	1	NULL	66034	5/21/04	Every meeting with her I have increases my hatred. The flakiest faculty member I have ever met. Don't depend on her for ANYTHING.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gabriela Popa	2.0	0	Science		3	2	1	NULL	66034	1/30/03	VERY VERY hard to understand what she says
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gabriela Popa	2.0	2	Science		5	5	4	2	66034	8/12/05	She always encourages her students to do their best and is always available for help. She's a really good teacher, especially if you go to see her for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gabriela Popa	2.0	0	Science		3	1	1	NULL	66034	2/18/03	her grading system is very easy, tests are decent, but she can't teach
Rochester Institute of Technology	Emil Posavac	2.0	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	1	955468	4/26/07	He doesnt make the topic interesting, class was boring, and hard to go to. Not an easy grade, and had to put lots of work into it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology	253	2	5	5	5	474610	4/22/10	Dr. Pough is a great professor! He posts all sorts of review material online and you can e-mail him responses to sample test questions, and the prepared question is posted online and is 1/2 of the testt grade. If you really love biology you can easily get an A. work in groups for the online quizzes and it's easy to get a 100 every time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	1	Biology		1	4	2	2	474610	10/1/09	I do believe that the professor do try his best to explain, but Intro to Biology was just too hard for me and I didn't understand a single thing. Take the class only if you can truly understand the very very IN-depth information about biology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	3	4	474610	11/25/08	This professor is very helpful, but the class is really hard. You better have a love for biology and reading because you'll have to stay in the book for this class, the lectures are boring and doesn't pertain to anything your supposed to be studying about. Just try and make sure your on top of the daily quizzes and the hw, because you'll need to!
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		1	5	4	5	474610	9/2/07	Great professor. Very difficult class, but it's one of the few thats worth the amount of time put in. If you go to him before assignments are due it will be a HUGE help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology	101	4	5	4	4	474610	7/26/07	Great professor...gently eases students into topics that are not very easy to grasp. Also gives great recommendation letters. If you have a problem he's always around to help out AND he's got a great tutoring program set up including tutoring at home from your computer and the tutors are really nice too =)
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology	204	3	5	5	3	474610	2/5/07	I have seen people not touch the book, and score well on his exams. He takes his questions for tests primarily from his lecture materials, which are well-supplemented by the book. If you want to do well in this course, READ the book. He gives bonus points for Clicker responses. He takes plenty of grades, so midterm and fnl don't completely kill you
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	5	5	474610	5/21/06	Excellent teacher. He is hard, and will make you work, but if you put the time in, you will get a lot out of the class. His midterm and final exams are hard, but much of your grade is based on other things. He is interesting and brilliant. He's definitely one of my all time favorite teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	5	5	474610	5/5/06	Dr. Pough will probably be one of the most interesting people you will ever meet. Getting a B is easy, as long as you do the weekly readings and come to class. Getting an A can be tricky. Going to his study sessions before exams is key to getting good grades on the exams. His lectures are always entertaining, and he will keep you interested.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	0	Biology		2	3	1	3	474610	10/26/05	What is he talking about????
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		3	5	4	4	474610	1/24/05	Pough's lectures are completely supplementary, read the book, kick back in lecture and get an A. He is a very nice guy and wants to help you, just don't get freaked out in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	1	Biology	253	3	3	2	2	474610	2/8/10	nice person and knows a lot but his tests are really confusing... you'll never know whats going to be on the test no matter how hard you study. I'll take him and just make sure you do all the HW and the Quizzes...you won't learn a lot but you'll pass the course with a decent grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	3	4	4	474610	3/18/09	i dont know where the material from the exams comes from, his lectures & the book don't really pertain to each other. exams are impossible to score well on--but if you take the time to review every review asgn. he puts on mycourses, youll at least come across the vast majority of questions on the test.the correct answers will remain mystery though
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		1	5	3	4	474610	2/14/08	Excellent teacher! Really smart
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology	253	2	3	4	5	474610	8/22/07	Interesting teacher. Make sure to go to class as to not miss the activities that count as points toward your grade (they really boost it to counter the uh, 60% avg for the tests) Tests are really difficult. Memorize the material and try to guess what goofy questions he'll have on. The pre test sessions online REALLY help. WRITE YOUR ESSAYS BEFORE!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	4	3	474610	4/30/07	Wonderful professor, skilled teacher, smart man. His lectures are sometimes interesting, but you can get away with not going if you read the book. Heavily weighted in-class activities are not good to miss. Live by the book...test questions transcend simple fact retention. Lab component is 50% of lecture grade, usually taught by a different PhD.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		3	4	5	5	474610	11/29/06	Excellent teacher. Explains concepts very well and is a fair grader. He trys very hard to make sure that we succeed and is very interesting. Take his Intro Bio class!! His tests are difficult for people because they are not used to thinking about stuff instead of memorizing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	474610	5/5/06	There are a million ways in Dr. Pough's class to ask a question and get it answered. If you come out of this class and still have questions, it's because you never asked them. His tests are tough because he's asking you to think more deeply than your used to, but it's a good thing! You can get a 60 on his exam and still get an A in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	474610	2/14/06	Clear, very helpful, but alot of reading required
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	4	4	4	474610	10/23/05	His lectures is pretty clear but you have to live and breathe with your Bio textbook in order to understand everything he has to teach... His quizzes is pretty easy but Midterm is really challenging so you will have to commit a large amount of time to read through the assigned reading and flash cards is pretty helpful with the facts and etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	0	Biology		2	2	1	4	474610	11/30/04	Lectures are boring as hell. If you want to get an A, you have to suck up and live by the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	2	Biology		2	5	4	4	474610	10/22/04	great class if your willing to get off your ass and read the book and pay attention during the lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	1	Biology		3	3	2	4	474610	10/19/04	Extremely confusing ppt presentations... test(open notebook) average is around 68% but only worth 30% of your grade. 15% of the class will get A's. Doesn't seem like you have a choice though - he's the only intro bio prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	F. Pough	3.8	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	474610	10/22/04	His lectures are damn blur~ confusing!!! but we r gonna stucked with him for one yesr! god help me!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brent Powell	4.5	2	Mathematics	101	4	5	4	2	1494769	11/12/10	Pretty good professor, take him if possible. Very available for extra help. Tests and quizzes are very easy. Homework is online and you can redo problems until you get them right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film	319	3	4	5	5	327797	8/22/07	Great teacher. Knows a lot and has a lot to share, even if literature/fine arts aren't really your thing. Great discussions and a fair grader. Gotta do the reading or you'll flunk.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film		3	4	5	1	327797	5/1/06	Great teacher. Workload is about right and in-class essays are easy if you know how to write. Final project was also easy. I didn't pay attention, but still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film		4	5	5	3	327797	10/6/04	He's wonderful, ends the class when the info's been said, has yet to go the full 2 hours of class. Has in-class essays, but they're relatively easy. Also uses a book that is very easy to get for a good price used, as it hasn't been updated in years.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film	101	4	5	5	3	327797	2/8/07	What everyone else said. Hes an all around good guy. Just go to class and you pretty much get a good grade. You do have to ready some, but nothing that bad. He allows you to miss up to 3 classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film		4	4	4	4	327797	5/1/05	MARK PRICE IS TEH MAN!!! classes short, interesting, and not too much work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Price	4.7	2	Film		4	5	5	NULL	327797	12/25/03	was the best teacher i had at rit! he made learning fun, and easy. i wish that i could have taken more classes with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tiffany Pritt	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	511308	2/7/06	She is the absolute GREATEST professor EVER!!! she explains everything thoroughly and if u ever need help she always does so with a smile. Ive never seen her mad, she just has the greatest presonality, shes AMAZING. *sigh* i cant say how great of a prof she is. If u have the opportunity to take her, DO IT!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tiffany Pritt	4.8	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	511308	12/29/04	Ms. Pritt is a veyr good teacher, and will always try to help you if you dont understand something. She's a very nice person as well.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering	607	3	5	5	5	340586	9/6/12	SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING! Great or should I say BEST teacher if you really want to learn without cracking open a textbook! You earn your grade however. labs are easy but the Test(s) require a crucial amount of studying ! STUDY!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering		3	3	4	2	340586	9/23/11	Had for Rigid Containers (Fall 2000), got C; Process Control, got A; 1/4 of Graduate Seminar, which I took as a Professional Elective. Rigid was ridiculously hard, my only C at RIT and my only non-A of the quarter. Process Control was unbelievably easy. Not the greatest explainer, and multiple choice questions could have up to 7 choices....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	340586	1/28/09	Karen is one of the only Packaging professors with real world applicable experience. She speaks with a knowledge level that is well deserving of an RIT education. Be GRATEFUL if you have her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	0	Engineering		1	1	3	3	340586	2/3/06	She has no tolerance for people who are not part of her "inner circle" or her favorite students. If you're not on her side, forget it. She also talks REALLY fast, and it's impossible to follow everything. The only teacher I know who manages to squeeze 2 hours worth of material into like 40 minutes, due to the rate of speech. Gives me a headache.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	3	340586	6/16/05	THe first comment must have been by someone who does not like Packaging. Karen cares about her students and is the first to come and defend packaging. She stepped up to the plate for me many times when she did not have to do it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering		2	4	4	5	340586	1/23/12	Quite the stickler, but knows her stuff! As long as you take proper notes (which are based off of the lecture slides she gives you) and you study properly, her tests are no big deal. She can be a bit temperamental wen it comes to grading, but will give you the credit back if deserved. You will learn so much!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	2	Engineering		2	4	3	4	340586	4/27/10	Great Professor, loves packaging and it shows during her lectures. Class is challenging and engaging. If you go to her for assistance and listen to her advice you will do well. Hard to squeeze an A out of her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	0	Engineering		1	2	2	5	340586	12/2/08	obnoxious voice, difficult tests, knows her stuff though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	0	Engineering		3	1	1	3	340586	8/29/05	As long as you sing to her tune you'll be alright other wise you're just another thorn in her side. Her only good appointments for professors are Fritz and Robinson.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Proctor	3.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	340586	9/24/04	The worst teacher int he whole program, i don't have any idea how she became the chairman
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raymond Ptucha	4.8	2	Engineering	675	5	5	5	5	1044076	12/2/11	Incredible course, incredible guy. Very straightforward with what he expected from you and if you had any problems, any at all, he would be more than willing to help. Even gave a lecture while he was out on conference. Really dedicated.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raymond Ptucha	4.8	2	Engineering		2	5	4	3	1044076	4/9/08	Good professor. Material is slightly boring and challenging, but he does his best to make sure you learn. Holds review sessions before all exams that are very helpful. Fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Raymond Ptucha	4.8	2	Engineering	340	1	5	5	5	1044076	4/14/08	VERY VERY good. He throws A LOT of material at you, but it's explained to the T. Do NOT miss class because there is SO much explained. He will come in for like 8 hours on a Sunday to help students and is VERY prompt and helpful via E-mail. His tests and homework are HARD, but you will learn SO much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rudy Pugliese	1.8	0	Communication	202	2	1	2	3	1037304	10/4/11	He was very unclear in how he wanted work done. Nothing he lectured on was covered in the tests, and his tests only covered very minute detail from the textbook. He makes it hard for students to do well/improve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rudy Pugliese	1.8	2	Communication		3	4	4	3	1037304	11/28/10	I know a lot of people don't like him, but I found him very friendly and easy to talk to. If you should the initiative, he's more than willing to help you. He's extremely knowledgeable, too! His side stories are interesting, and I thought they were helping in remembering things. Remember, if it bleeds, it leads! Tests are okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rudy Pugliese	1.8	0	Communication		3	1	2	3	1037304	7/22/09	This professor does not provide a clear outline of assignments, often you will not know what you are being graded on. He is a reasonable enough guy, but seems to think he knows best, always. So while he may not be a bad professor, he is also not for everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rudy Pugliese	1.8	0	Communication		2	1	1	3	1037304	1/6/11	I questioned Rudy about my opinion and he sent me the most immature response I have ever seen from a Professor (So bad I might report him for the way he attacked me). The man thinks he is superior to everyone on this planet. I recommend staying away from him, even online classes...I learned the hard way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rudy Pugliese	1.8	0	Communication	101	3	1	1	4	1037304	4/26/10	He is a jerk. Do not take any of his classes. Rudy thinks he knows everything. He just teaches to shove his superiority in your face. I don't even want to go to class and I'm a straight A student. Sometimes, seriously, I want to scream at him. If you have to take his class, best to grin, bear it, and ignore Rudy as much as possible...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew  Quagliata	4.5	2	Communication		3	4	4	3	1766656	3/7/13	Quizzes were 30 questions in 35 min. Great teacher. Kind of a hard grader but if you have the chance to take him then you should. I got an A. Also not too much homework or work but 2 big presentations- one individual and one group.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew  Quagliata	4.5	2	Communication	501	4	5	5	4	1766656	11/14/12	Probably the best teacher at this school, willing to meet with you any time. All he cares about is that you learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Raco	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	4	5	5	1695766	10/25/12	Very cool dude. I love him but sometimes he likes to scare you but I realized he's doing that to make you want to work harder. He's a great teacher. He will get mad if you miss his class, especially when you don't text him or email him letting him know first.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	471297	11/29/12	It was honor for me to take his classes. He really loves wht he is doing. Lectures are very interesting and inspiring. Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science	380	4	5	5	4	471297	8/26/09	Lectures were always a pleasure to attend: he has a very warm and friendly demeanor, is skilled in presenting complex concepts in an accessible manner, and has a profound understanding of the material he was teaching (CS Theory.) Constantly made an effort to remain aware of the level of comprehension of the class and adjust accordingly. Great prof
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	471297	1/26/06	Awesome professor. He's really excited about what he teaches and is more than willing to help if you don't understand something. Class is pretty tough, but you really learn the material well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	2	471297	11/27/04	Seemed like a realy hard, strict guy, but he's really great. Has an effective teaching style, and is always fair. He even has a sense of humor. If you can make a class like foundations of cs theory interesting, you got to be good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	0	Computer Science	482	1	2	1	4	471297	11/5/12	Had him for Cryptography. He was impossible to understand and not good at answering Questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science	482	1	5	4	4	471297	9/4/08	Awesome with a side of awesomesauce. Staggering amount of crypto and math knowledge. He has an accent, but isn't difficult to understand. Grades hard, but curves a lot. For example, I got a 40% on the midterm and a B in the class. Don't be discouraged by the grades - he knows the material can be difficult. Do the work and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stanislaw Radziszowski	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	471297	10/14/05	Tough tough professor, but couldn't be a nicer guy. Wants you to learn and is willing to go the extra mile to see that you do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan  Raisanen	4.0	2	Engineering		3	5	3	4	1796956	2/8/13	Very helpful in class. Good presentations. Watch out for the project, it is 50% of your grade, it is outside of class and will cost you money on top of books and tuition. Doesn't understand how important some of the grades are in his own class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Powel	5.0	2	Business	310	3	5	5	3	1039248	3/12/08	Best prof. ever. Loved the class discussions...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	1102290	3/2/13	Great professor. His lectures are simple and easy to understand. He assigns weekly workshop for a group to work on. Workshops are helpful for practicing for weekly quizzes that are given out at the last class of week. Quizzes are fair. There are no trick questions. He is the best math professor I ever had in my all classes in RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	5	1102290	1/17/13	Best professor I've had, by far!!! I enjoyed going to class. He always made class fun and entertaining. Class work is easy and projects are too. I would take a class just because he was teaching even if I didn't need the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	273	3	5	5	3	1102290	5/18/12	Amazing teacher. Keeps the class just serious enough to work, but not too serious, so it doesn't feel like you're being lectured at.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	4	1102290	4/25/12	AWESOME professor. Easily my favorite professor thus far. He is very easy to understand, and workshops go over exactly what you know, no surprises. Tests/quizzes are possibly the easiest I have taken in my life. He is hilarious to boot, so take it you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1102290	3/6/12	Best math teacher I've ever had in my life... His classes aren't mandatory, but if you don't go to class, good luck. He's really chill, EXTREMELY helpful, and makes learning calc a breeze... and fun!!! He makes his workshops hard on purpose, so that you do really well on his tests and quizzes. Take this professor!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	11/10/11	Quite possibly the best Math teacher I have ever had. Made learning calculus a breeze. Highly recommend.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	2/5/11	Professor Prevendoski is amazing. He is funny and makes class so much fun. He will make sure the entire class understands the material before moving on. Attendance is not mandatory, but you must get all of your work done. He treats his students like equals and is very fair. If you can, TAKE HIM. You won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	1102290	10/27/10	The best math teacher I've ever had.

He has an awesome sense of humor and it's a really relaxing learning environment. Quizzes are easy. Our homework is done in class. Prof. Prevendoski, if you're reading this: you're downright awesome. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	261	4	5	4	4	1102290	10/11/11	Calc Foundations I, really awesome teacher helpful and clear, weekly quizzes, homework and attendance are optional, but I highly suggest doing the homework just because if your new to that level of math it will help ALOT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	5	4	1102290	4/26/11	He is a fantastic teacher, He really cares about his students and is always willing to do everything he can to help you get the material, He has even come in on his day off to help me a few times, thats says alot. I recommend him to anyone who wants to learn calc from the best professor on campus.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	271	3	5	5	5	1102290	10/26/10	Prof. Prevendoski is an awesome professor. He knows what he's doing and is fun and lively while teaching the class. He grades fairly and will pick fun if you make stupid mistakes. Over all, he's amazing and I plan on taking as many classes with him as I can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	4	1102290	2/24/10	Fantastic professor, explains everything very well and he is very helpful if you have any questions. Doesn't care if you come to class as long as you get the work done that you miss and don't fail the tests. All around great guy too. Highly recommend you take his class if you're taking calc
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	1102290	2/4/10	Hands down the best teacher around...all around great dude highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	2	1102290	1/26/10	This man is a walking God amongst math professors. He knows his material and can actually answer questions. His workshops are related to the work and the weekly Quizzes give us easy grades. Very fair and his sense of humor keeps the class from getting boring. A must take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1102290	11/2/09	Must have if you want to learn math with minimal studying needed. He explains everything in class, and the in class workshops clear anything you missed. He is flat out on what he expects and is a generous grader. He will help until you get it and approaches in multiple angles if needed. The class is fun and if you dont show up you are stupid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	4/28/09	Excellent professor. Extremely willing to help if you need it. I also like that we do workshops in class so you can test what you've learned before you get to the homework and realize you don't know a thing. Easily one of the best math instructors I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	1/22/09	Awesome guy and a great professor. He makes class fun and intersting with his humor. More importantly, he explains everything crystal-clear and is willing to do whatever it takes to get you to understand the material. Very fair grader. Only tests you on concepts that you need to know
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	1102290	10/14/08	awsome guy. wickit helpful. if you go to his classes and show you care he will do everthing he can to help you out. wish i could have him as a teacher forever class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	4	4	1102290	5/13/08	Excellent professor. I would take him again if I could. Do your work, show your work, and you'll be fine. Teaches well, doesn't try to trick you on tests or quizzed. Overall - GREAT!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1102290	4/24/08	Excellent teacher and a great guy. If you can you should pick this teacher. You get homework once a week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	1102290	3/9/08	Really fun teacher. He's a good break from the other math professors. Gives a week grace period for homework and workshops. Homework is out of the book and every other week. If you fall asleep in class, he'll take your picture. so stay awake!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1102290	2/9/10	A simply fantastic professor. If you are having trouble, taking him will fix it. If you aren't, its a fairly easy class. Homework is mandatory but relevant and light, and attendance is flexible. He's fun, friendly, and easily approachable. Don't fall asleep though! He WILL take your picture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	103	3	5	5	4	1102290	1/29/10	Had him for Calc A, B, and C. Kept the class interesting, lively, and was always available to help. Absolutely the best teacher I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	11/23/09	he was awesome, very easily approachable, talks to you like an equal, and he is a really great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1102290	10/15/09	Very good teacher, very good at explaining the material, very funny... Will pick on you for "dumb moves" but in a not mean way. Does not use WebAssaign =. Everything is written out on the board
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	272	5	5	5	2	1102290	3/12/09	Great professor. Very student-oriented, keeps class interesting and explains the material well. Less strict on attendance/assignments than other teachers, but still concerned for students' progress and always willing to help out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	3	1102290	10/22/08	Very good teacher, keeps class light and entertaining while still getting everything. I would highly recommend him for any class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	1102290	10/10/08	Awesome guy, very helpful. Interesting teaching style. Workshops definitely help with comprehension of new topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	4	1102290	5/3/08	Prevendoski is awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	261	3	5	5	4	1102290	3/10/08	Easily the best teacher I've ever had. Unlike most of the math department, he doesn't take attendance, so if you know the material already, you don't have to show up every day to sit through boring review sessions. He also gives a week grace period on homeworks, which is good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1102290	2/27/08	Awesome professor! Very helpful. Knows what he's talking about, teaches clearly and writes neatly. If you do all his homeworks and workshops, the tests will look very similar. He's lax on attendance and gives you a week grace period for homeworks and workshops. This guy's an A+ and a MUST-TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Prevendoski	4.9	2	Mathematics	211	4	4	4	2	1102290	2/10/08	best math teacher i've had in a while. very easy grader, awsome teaching methods, low workload, tho if u fall alseep in his class, expect to see camera's in ur face when u wake up
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Pritchard	4.5	2	Business	430	5	5	5	5	1039247	5/24/10	Very great professor. There are no tests or quizzes. As long as you come to class and do the work assigned, you should get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Pritchard	4.5	2	Business		5	3	5	4	1039247	11/14/08	He is a great teacher. Read the book and you will be fine. He is a nice person that is easy to talk to. Take his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Pritchard	4.5	2	Business		5	5	4	4	1039247	7/22/09	Great professor! Always willing to talk to the class, encourages questions. His teaching style worked well for me. (more writing less testing)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Pritchard	4.5	2	Business		4	4	5	5	1039247	8/14/08	Dr. Pritchard is very experienced in International Business and tries to cover the most practical aspects of the field with students instead of making the class difficult. He tells students what to expect on exams (but you still need to prepare) and gives the entire quarter to prepare for finals projects. Low stress, good instruction, great prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ruben Proano	3.1	1	Engineering		2	2	3	2	1478480	11/15/12	May be having lot of knowledge but I feel he should be polite to his students. Expects a lot from his students but not delivers that much in class. He expects a lot from the Masters thesis and has a reputation of not letting students graduate on time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ruben Proano	3.1	2	Engineering		3	5	4	5	1478480	2/9/11	Encourages questioning, very appreciative of your views and doubts. challenging assignments that consume time. generous correction. needs to improve clarity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ruben Proano	3.1	2	Engineering		2	4	5	4	1478480	11/17/11	A very motivating professor and willing to help. I little bit more use of the book would help. He is hard enough to challenge you to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ruben Proano	3.1	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	1478480	1/27/11	He is well-educated but can't deliver. His evaluation methods are still a big puzzle to me. A good guy but unfortunately not a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Prusinski	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	4	567176	5/10/06	David is AWESOME! he's very friendly but can be strict when he needs to especially with the drawings because he cares and wants you to improve. but the classes are fun & flexible, but if you're immature and show you're not interested in the course, then he'll make your time hell. :) just use your common sense!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Prusinski	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		1	3	4	1	567176	10/3/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivan Puchades	4.9	2	Electrical Engineering	318	5	5	5	2	1696691	11/15/12	Very laid back and funny, explains things clearly, tests are basically hw problems, usually took me about 25 minutes to do. By far the best (and easiest) circuits prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivan Puchades	4.9	2	Electrical Engineering	101	5	5	4	5	1696691	3/4/12	Very straight forward in his teaching methods, tells you exactly what he wants. The tests are short and to the point. The questions are usually borrowed from the homework. Also a very lenient test grader and has a good sense of humor, would recommend him to anyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivan Puchades	4.9	2	Electrical Engineering		5	5	5	5	1696691	10/17/12	Very handsome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ivan Puchades	4.9	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	5	1696691	2/27/12	Had him during his first quarter teaching, and was pretty impressed. Very organized and laid back, gives lots of clear examples during lecture and is very understanding of student needs and difficulties.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Collette Quaglia	2.8	0	Fine Arts	121	2	1	2	4	1101614	4/11/12	Not helpful in teaching painting skills
Rochester Institute of Technology	Collette Quaglia	2.8	2	Fine Arts	102	2	4	4	3	1101614	5/11/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Quinsland	5.0	2	Science		5	5	5	5	1556463	6/11/12	The best professor ever at NTID!! I strongly suggest you to take him for bachelors science level courses. You can ask him any questions you would like and you will learn much more than RIT's science courses. Much more personalized learning experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Quinsland	5.0	2	Science		5	5	5	5	1556463	4/2/11	He rocks big time!!!!! He's very good grader and he comes up many activities for us to learn. He's really flexible with us. He also makes this class so much fun! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Larry Quinsland	5.0	2	Science		5	5	5	5	1556463	11/9/11	He's most genius professor ever I see!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	4	3	63753	3/8/13	His teaching style is very clear. He uses a lot of examples so that you really understand, and the tests are quite easy if you do the workshop packets he gives. Definitely should take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics		3	1	3	2	63753	12/2/11	One of the worst. What some people call concern I call irritating. He expects emails for missed classes, this is not the 7th grade. He openly rejects and discourages questions. He is one of the most pompous human beings ever. I went to his office hours and he told me he wouldn't answer one of my questions. Hate him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	63753	8/18/11	One of the most rewarding professors you could have. If you put the effort in to his class, he'll put the effort into making sure you get it. It's always reassuring to have him on my schedule.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	63753	4/25/11	Very organized and straight forward. If you are worried about not understanding calculus, take his class. While it may be a lot of work, you will come out knowing calculus better than anyone else. He is very fair grading hw and tests. If you skip class, come late, or give him additude hes not going to like you, and therefore he will not curve youup
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	63753	4/19/11	The professor was teaching a GRE Prep Course, but went through the material so quickly covering 8-9 topics per class that he hardly used any examples from the book. He stresses practice but doesn't understand that if you can't start a problem you can't understand how to practice them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	271	2	5	4	3	63753	2/1/11	Dr. Radin is not only a great teacher but an awesome guy. Can be funny at times. The test questions come DIRECTLY from the workshops so study them and you'll be fine. Great grader looks to help you out and give you points. Attend all classes and be respectful to his rules and you'll be fine. One of RIT's best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	63753	8/3/10	Hes awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	63753	4/17/10	good prof has some attitude but hes very good, easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	271	2	4	4	5	63753	2/25/10	I had him 3x. Great professor, there's a lot of work but it pays off in the end. A bit of an attitude, but I think he notices it sometimes and tries to play it off as being humorous. The accent it a little thick, but it's nothing that the notes won't clear up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The best Math Professor at RIT. I wish he was a Physics Prof. as well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	1	63753	2/2/10	Radin is an excellent professor who explains everything very clearly, but his attitude can make the class completely unbearable. He seems to have the mentality of many HS teachers -- "You owe me something. I'm not here for you, you are here for me." You will learn a ton in his class, but not without incredible frustration with his attitude.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	281	3	5	5	5	63753	11/5/12	Dr. Radin was one of the best teachers I have ever had. He can be slightly stubborn at times, however, he is always willing to help and accommodate anyone. I definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	63753	9/6/11	Dr. Radin is definitely the best professor I've had. He is extremely clear when it comes to lectures, due dates, tests, and expectations. He really cares about his students and will get on your case if you've been missing class and/or haven't turned in homework. He always sends out email reminders about upcoming tests, assignments, etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	273	2	5	5	4	63753	5/19/11	Honestly Dr. Radin is as great an instructor as a come. Clear lectures. Organized. Fair. He expects all of his students to seek him if they are stuck because he is very thorough with all of his material. If I could take him for all of my math classes I would. With out 100% effort there is no success in his class. You will have learned so much!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	123	4	5	5	4	63753	4/25/11	One of the smartest professors I've ever met, not only does he have his doctorate in Mathematics but he also has a masters in Mechanical Engineering. Really knows his stuff and how it applies to real world situations. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	273	5	5	5	4	63753	2/5/11	Great Professor. Best Calculus Professor that I have been taught by. His teaching methods stress practice. Staying on task is key. Not that hard to do so in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	63753	11/24/10	This guys awesome. He has such a contagious personality. Very nice guy you cant hate him. He has an accent but clear enough with explanations that its negligible. Strict but hes upfront about his rules all the time. Grading is very forgiving and all questions on tests are from the weekly workshops. DONT FALL BEHIND ON THE WORKSHOPS! He checks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	273	2	5	5	4	63753	4/27/10	Dr. Radin is undoubtedly the best professor I have personally had the privilege of learning from. His devotion to the academic advancement of his students goes without saying, and his techniques are clean cut and well organized. I would without hesitation try to be under his instruction.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	63753	3/11/10	Dr. Radin is THE BEST math prof. at RIT. His lectures are crystal clear.Workshops are easy as most of the questions are repetitive questions.His tests are fair and easy as the questions are from the workshops. All the workshops are not due until Week 6. Bonus pts on tests for neat work. U wont need 2 go 2 his office hours/extra help if you do wrksh
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	63753	2/17/10	good
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics	271	2	1	3	3	63753	11/9/09	Worst professor ever. The man figured out how to lecture a mathematics course. It was horrendous. He assigns preposterous amounts of work to do and then is difficult to approach with a problem. His accent and ticks (such as "Hoe-kee") quickly get annoying, and you learn nothing. I blame him for my losing interest in mathematics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	271	4	4	3	4	63753	10/27/09	Kind of a love/hate relationship. Workshops are long and a lot of work, but you'll quickly realize that you're learning a lot more than you would with a more laid back teacher. He does have a bit of an accent, but understands the material very well. Grading is based on how much work you show, not on correctness. VERY easy to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	3	63753	8/31/09	horrible teacher, hard to understand
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	272	5	4	5	5	63753	6/5/08	I'll admit I was a tad freaked out when I first met him. I answered one question and he expected me to answer every single one after that. Even so, he grew on me. He's an EXTREMELY generous grader and really tries to cram the material in your head. If you can't get an A in this class, you must be braindead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	63753	2/4/08	Great teacher! Radin has very specific techniques that he wants his students to follow, but he explains them with crystal clarity and gives plenty of examples. Also, he is an extremely generous grader.He can make you understand what's going on. Even if you aren't the best math student in the world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	3	63753	1/22/08	Will not answer questions in class. Everything *must* be done his way (showing every step). Good class if you aren't a math major. The homework and workshops are redundant and he can spend 15 minutes on a problem. Recommend if you are bad at math, like tons of repeat homework, and non-english professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	63753	12/5/07	Best professor I have had here at RIT. This man cares about his students more than any professor I've had. I highly recommend Radin.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	63753	10/16/07	He is very strict, but if you do the work you'll learn a lot and get a good grade. Definitely worth taking if you're not too good at math. He pushes you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	272	2	5	4	2	63753	7/16/07	He is a great teacher, however he gives ALOT of homework and he is very strict. His tests are also the real deal, hard stuff; you must study for quite awhile to do well on his tests. Despite this he will teach you well, and you will learn if you put effort in. If you are willing to work sometimes 6 hours on homework, he's your teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	63753	2/22/07	Easily the most pompous **** I've ever met. He hates in-class questions, gives very poor examples, and he has a specific way of doing EVERYTHING. He will not accept work not done in his format. Did I also mention that he is the most bitter person in the world?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	63753	7/12/06	Highly reccomend this professor. Awesome job of teaching the materials and trying to make sure you understand. Workshop experiances were worth it. to get a A, attend all classes and workshops. Also study well! fun professor too laid back
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	63753	10/9/09	He was a great professor. I only took one quarter with him, but it was because he helped me test out of the class. He was very helpful and was very easy to approach with questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	63753	4/29/09	without a doubt the best teacher i have ever had! his lessons are clear and he makes the material very easy to understand. Dr. Radin is very dedicated to his job as well as his students. he is always eager and happy to help you if you don't understand something. he really got me interested in math, they should make him head of the department!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	3	63753	3/30/08	If you enjoy listening to an incomprehensible idiot for two hours then you will enjoy this class. He is a very easy teacher and you will most likely get a good grade, however I now feel almost completely lost in my Calc 3 class. He dumbed everything down and can't handle questions. Everything revolves around his packets,expo markers, and pictures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	63753	2/4/08	He is the BEST math teacher at this school! He is very clear on the material he teaches. He gives homework weekly, but its normally easy questions. If you do the work you will get an A, no doubt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	63753	1/5/08	He is a great teacher. Always looking to help you out and his lessons are crystal clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	5	4	63753	11/14/07	One of the best math professors at RIT. Too bad he's not a Physics professor there as well because he would be the best physics one as well. I understood the concept of integrating work in his Calc class while was highly confused in Physics. He's very helpful and almost always available. He's sends out email regarding tests, office hours and HW.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	4	63753	8/23/07	amazing professor, helpful and does teaches well. I have no idea what the other reviewer in Calc D is saying about, This guy does really helps a lot and answers in class questions. I wouldnt have got though this with a B without his help at all. props to him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	63753	3/12/07	Good teacher, very strict but explains all steps of the problems. Tests are based on HW but he's a very tough grader and takes points off for things not done his way. Still recommend him because you actually learn a lot in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	63753	11/29/06	Great class with a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	63753	11/9/05	this guy can make a speed head fall asleep, DO NOT TAKE any class he teaches before noon!! Other than that he's an awsome professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	63753	11/7/05	very good professor. Although sometime is lecture make me fall asleep. BUt he very easy and very help ful in explaining the material. He did his example very slow. So, it is your fault if you still can't get the material. RECOMMEND TO PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS... OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT LOST... I like him, but only i wish he could move a lil bit quic
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	63753	9/15/05	Best teacher I have had at RIT. Concise, thorough, and very easy to follow. Exams are always straight forward. If you do the homework and workshops, you should get an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	63753	5/3/05	Awesome teacher. Very clear. 100x better than Luce or tascione. If you want someone that can actually teach, take Radin.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	3	4	1	63753	1/22/05	Very good teacher. Makes the subject very easy if you go to every class. Organized, passes stuff back very quickly. easy to ace the class if you payattention, otherwise your ****ed
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	NULL	63753	4/17/04	I thought he was a nice guy. He always hands stuff back on time. Ver y orgnaized and a great teacher. Explains math in a way anyone could understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	NULL	63753	2/18/03	Less than masterful grasp of the English language. Rude. Strict.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	63753	10/5/05	Very good teacher, just do your work, it's a lot and it only gets more difficult, but he's always there to help and explain.... takes FOREVER writing examples on the board, so if you don't get it, you have no excuse

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	63753	1/31/05	Excellent teacher. He explains the material in a way thats easy to understand, encourages extra help in his office, hands papers back quickly. Very organized and neat. Tests are very very similar to the homework so do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	63753	10/28/04	good guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	NULL	63753	2/29/04	my tutor tells me that what he gave us in calc I wasnt even taught in Calc III, other than that he is a nice guy...still, avoid at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Radin	4.3	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	63753	2/10/03	extremely organized and effective teacher. Hard homework and hard tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryne Raffaelle	4.8	2	Physics		4	5	4	NULL	66027	12/3/02	take him, and don't expect any better physics professor than him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryne Raffaelle	4.8	2	Physics		3	5	5	NULL	66027	10/1/02	His lectures are interesting, and both hepful outside of class and a fair grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryne Raffaelle	4.8	2	Physics		2	5	5	NULL	66027	10/5/02	take him!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		2	5	3	5	1132202	5/10/10	One of, if not THE best in his field. His work is amazing, and hes a phenomenal teacher. Definitely take him if you have the chance, you'll have to work your ass off but you will learn so so much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism	123	3	5	4	5	1132202	12/3/09	I love James Rajotte. He is a great professor.. and a great photographer. Ask him questions, you can learn a lot from him. He is hilarious, once you get to know his sense of humor. I miss his class horribly. Also, he is young so I feel that his teaching style is extremely refreshing. Take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		2	5	5	4	1132202	10/15/09	He knows how o explain from a simple stand point.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		3	4	3	4	1132202	2/4/09	James pushes you to do your very best and he will say it in crit if it is not your best. His crits maybe harsh to some people, but that is how one gets better. He doesn't assign essays and the tests are 5 questions (but I don't think they matter towards your final grade). He most likely to give you a B, but you learn so much that it is worth it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		3	5	4	5	1132202	2/2/10	The greatest photo professor ever.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		2	4	3	4	1132202	10/15/09	Rajotte is a very complex and interesting photographer/professor. He challenges you to step out of your comfort zone to become a better photographer, and you eventually do. He is very helpful during edits and critiques. Definitely recommended if you want to become a great photographer
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		2	4	4	4	1132202	9/28/09	James is really good at helping you talk through projects. He's not afraid to call out people for bad images. He pushes his students technically. You have to learn to get his sense of humor and understand when he's being serious and when he's joking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Rajotte	4.3	2	Photojournalism		3	5	4	5	1132202	2/1/09	challenging but fun. you'll learn a lot & will definitely improve
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	2	Information Technology	219	3	4	4	2	815796	11/12/08	Prof. Ramme is a good Java teacher in a place where they are scarce. He understands fully that programming is hard,frustrating,and time consuming,and as such gives students ample opportunities to improve their grade should something go afoul on an exam or assignment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	0	Information Technology		4	2	2	2	815796	9/23/08	He's a nice guy but his presentation of the topics covered is meteocore. Sometimes he can't give a clear example on what is being discussed. Like someone said, he does look at the floor when he speaking. I guess that is his way of not losing his chain of thought. He does offer to help, that too is useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	1	815796	2/5/08	Nice guy-- cracks jokes often to keep the class interesting. Pretty easy in class assignments for easy grades-- you just gotta go to class to keep up with them. The practicals are a bit rough, but he does give a "practice" practical the class before which is good review but usually leaves some key points out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	815796	10/22/08	Ken is always willing to help you succeed in his class. He is very open to changing around and accepting stuff if you can't get it to him on time, and will help you as much as he can with tests. An excellent teacher and great person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	2	Information Technology	220	5	5	5	4	815796	3/11/08	Ken Ramme is a great teacher, very helpful and understands how to work with students effectively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kenneth Ramme	3.7	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	3	815796	2/28/06	It was his first time teaching Needs Assessment and he didn't do a very good job. The class average was around high 60s. Does not encourage questions and often look down on the floor while speaking. The exam questions was vague. However he does give fair grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology		1	1	1	3	1142632	9/11/11	I had this professor for Industrial Psych over the summer. Even though this was supposed to be just a general course, he expected everyone to be very interested in it an elaborate on everything. He was vague and deadlines were unclear. After a lot of people messed up, he would send out a message questioning why this would happen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology		1	2	1	4	1142632	11/12/10	Terrible. Could not understand a word he was saying due to a heavy Indian accent, and spoke way too fast to actually take notes. Term paper was impossible, he criticized my paper, and gave me a zero on it stating that my writing was bad and that he couldn't read it. Went to him for help and he told me to get help from the writing lab.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology	532	1	1	1	2	1142632	5/21/10	He taught Judgment and Decision Making and he never used a book. He had us read complicated articles and expected us to participate. He didn't teach the course very well. When we asked him what a word meant, he said "use a dictionary." He asked for our feedback, but didn't use them. We ask for his help and he just pretty much shrugged us off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology		1	1	2	4	1142632	1/12/09	Used a textbook that was way too advanced for our knowledge level in Judgment and Decision-making. Just about everybody in class made that clear and he said he would try to adjust to that, but never did. He only emphasized we kept reading. He had us read 14 or 15 chapters just in 4 weeks (on top of the fact that the books already hard to read).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	1	Psychology		2	3	2	4	1142632	5/30/08	Knows his stuff but not how to teach it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	1	Psychology		1	3	2	2	1142632	5/17/11	he is a nice guy ,but terrible at teaching level.I do not understand anything from his lectures.His lectures are based on presentation and he is not an easy grader anyway i withdrew from his class.I am happy now!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology	402	1	1	1	3	1142632	8/25/10	Nice person, terrible teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology		2	2	2	2	1142632	4/15/10	He is a nice guy but does not know how to teach out of 40 students no one got above a B. He is very boring and just mumbles the entire class. If you want to pass you have to not only read the book cover to cover multiple times but also get help from other teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Esa Rantanen	1.7	0	Psychology	402	3	2	2	2	1142632	10/24/08	Was an ok teacher until about half way through when he kept saying that it wasn't a stat class but keeps teaching us stats, but then doesn't really know what he is talking about. Also, stupid HW assignments and final worth 60% of grade? Doesn't really know how to organize a class/is always "too busy" to have done the things he said he would like hw
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature		5	5	4	3	468879	3/3/13	He was a great professor! He is very smart and if you go to his offices hours you will learn a lot. He gives you range to do whatever you want for the final project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		2	1	1	3	468879	5/3/12	He is clearly a very intelligent man, but he has difficultly speaking concisely and often rambles for entire lectures without saying much. He gives off a very condescending attitude and doesn't seem particularly sympathetic toward students. And he didn't give any grades until the very end of the class so nobody had any idea how they were doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature	325	3	2	2	1	468879	6/14/10	Ray is a very intelligent man and has the ability, and I believe he enjoys, making everyone in the class feel inferior and stupid. I was put into his Honors Lit and Tech class my first quarter, and I absolutely hated the class. He rambles about nothing, makes us read the weirdest books, and he never graded us on anything. Beware!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature	101	5	5	4	3	468879	10/26/09	I found his classes really interesting. The work required really was not all that much. The only big problem I could see people having with this professor was that attendance is absolutely mandatory and he doesn't like when you're late. If you can show up to class, you can get an A. He's pretty interesting as well, which is a plus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature	482	2	3	4	4	468879	11/1/07	Obviously very knowledgeable on a number of subjects. I really enjoyed the course and I am so glad I took it. I really liked him as a teacher. A lot of the comments on here are really negative, so maybe he teaches certain courses very differently than he teaches others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature	101	4	4	5	3	468879	11/29/06	I have no idea why he is rated so low. If you do the work and listen to what he says, he is more than fair. You can revise your work for a higher grade. If I can get an A in this class, anyone can. Also, he's been nominated for the Eisenhart several times and he's relatively new. Good teacher, good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		4	2	1	1	468879	10/19/06	His Writing Seminar is quite possibly one of the most boring classes you could take. He never clarifys what he wants you to really write about. His ascinine remarks to anything you say that has any relevance to the course but differs from his own opinion gets old after the first day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		4	2	1	5	468879	1/19/05	One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, dreaded it every Mon. & Wed. Nobody understands a word he says and he takes great pleasure in 'stumping' the class. Does not like anybody disagreeing with him, even if they have a valid arguement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature		3	5	3	3	468879	10/6/04	This class was basically on the Simpsons, but even with that being the textbook, it's still a little dry. Nevertheless, Amit's a really nice guy and generally doesn't mind deviating from the scheduled discussions, so occasionally the classes are riveting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature	210	3	2	1	3	468879	10/19/12	Very intelligent guy, but the lectures are muddled at best. I still have no idea what he expects from us in regards to work, assignments, or discussions. Not helpful when asked for clarification on anything. What the heck am I being graded on!?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature	462	2	4	4	1	468879	3/30/11	Professor Ray doesn't slow down for you. But he has a way of returning to earlier points and building on them. His teaching style seems a lot like the Borges we read. Dense, seemingly contradictory and (to use one of his favorite words) recursive-he regularly used examples from current events to illustrate points. I learned to learn in new ways.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		2	1	2	2	468879	2/25/10	I didn't like him as a teacher at all. I felt he was very bland and talked a lot. For the writing, his comments about correcting it were unclear. He can also be very blunt on how he feels about your writing during class. I did not like him at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		3	1	1	1	468879	1/1/09	all he talked about was youtube, the election, and radiohead. i put up with this crap and he had the nerve to give me a C when the other members in my group got As
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	2	Literature		3	5	3	5	468879	8/18/07	Honestly one of the best classes I've taken at RIT. I've taken four classes with him, and have loved all of them. He can be a little dry, but he's extremely intellegent and if you can comprehend 60percent of what he says than you're gaining a lot. This is what college classes SHOULD be like.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		3	1	1	1	468879	11/24/06	Terrible professor. Wrote a 4 page a paper which he admitted was good at first. Then I miss two classes and go to see him in the office. For no reason he rips my paper finding out all these stupid flaws in it, which I had an answer for. Just a bad professor who said I was waisting his time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amit Ray	2.7	0	Literature		2	1	1	4	468879	5/25/06	Really boring and gets very defensive if you offer an opinion that differs from his & isn't willing to listen to you at all. Just goes on and on, without anybody having any idea what he's talking abt and at the end, it's a mad race to get out of the classroom. Will never take another class with him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	2	Art History		3	4	5	3	971220	4/30/11	Was afraid to take exhibit design after hearing other comments, class is a lot of work but everything is spelled out really clearly, Prof consistently asks for feedback to make sure no one is overwhelmed. Decent class, good guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	2	Art History	213	4	3	4	1	971220	11/9/09	Professor Reade is a nice guy, but he doesn't really teach you much. His lectures quickly get boring and the movies he shows are mind-numbing. One of the two books we read was good, the other was terrible. His class isn't terribly hard, but it is boring, so although I don't suggest it, it's tolerable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	0	Art History		2	1	1	1	971220	2/4/09	He is the worst teacher on earth!! His grading scale is 80-100 is an A, he never tells you this until the last week. He is a horrible grader and the tests have NOTHING to do with what he lectures on. I wasted 4 hours of my life every Tuesday night!! Don't take him, DON'T take this class even if it is not with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	0	Art History		1	1	1	1	971220	11/30/08	Professor reade is the worst teacher EVER. I learned nothing in his class. He asked us what shape a circle was once and wasn't even joking. True story. If you want to keep a decent GPA and don't want to waste your life on 4 of the most boring hours of your life... DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	2	Art History		4	5	5	5	971220	4/27/08	Cryil is the freaking best teacher of all time. Even while I was doing horrible on all of the tests he always would give me help. He is kickass. kickass. Take his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	0	Art History		1	1	1	1	971220	2/1/08	Reade's an awful teacher. He is biased and he does not know how to teach. He talks unstoppable for 2 hours on a piece of art.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	1	Art History	505	3	4	2	2	971220	3/31/07	Not too bad for an Art History teacher. workload isn't too bad at all either, just a reading you can skim and a reading response to turn in every week. It doesn't hurt that he's got one of the best asses I've ever seen on a man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	0	Art History	425	3	1	1	1	971220	4/28/11	Doesn't teach at all. Just talks. Doesn't really explain what he wants just talks in airy language that you are supposed to somehow miraculously understand what he wants. WAY TOO MUCH WORK.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	2	Art History	101	3	5	3	4	971220	5/15/09	A great Professor. Most of the bad comments are from the lazy RIT students who are used to profs who just give everyone an A and dont care. Prof Reade really teaches you and makes you think, if you are willing to learn and do the work. I love his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	1	Art History		5	4	2	2	971220	2/1/09	awesome dude. gives everyone A's.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	0	Art History		1	2	2	1	971220	10/22/08	wow, I am not into art what so ever and was placed in this class to fulfill credits. It was terrible. It was 4 hours long and extremely boring. I cant wait until this quarter ends. AAAHHH
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	1	Art History	213	3	3	2	4	971220	2/18/08	Seems like a good enough professor, but you can't tell exactly what he wants from you on a test. Then he blames the whole class for getting it messed up when it's obviously his fault for not being clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	2	Art History		3	5	4	4	971220	1/23/08	this dude is awesome and totally chilled out. He knows his stuff and he knows how to defend art. I dug his class and learned a lot about composition.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cyril Reade	2.7	1	Art History	213	3	2	3	1	971220	10/23/07	Workload is very low and there is no textbook. Quizzes are extremely hard expecially if your major is NOT art/photo based. Expects that you know about art before taking class. Should be an easy B, maybe an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Reddig	5.0	2	Design		3	5	5	5	923974	3/26/11	who doesnt love alan? He's a great guy, has a sense of humor, and knows A LOT about the history of industrial design.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Reddig	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	3	923974	12/4/06	He knows everything about anything! His feedback on work is helpful and clear, and he does have a perfection expectation!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Reddig	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	5	923974	1/26/10	Great teacher. I have had him for three classes including Consumer Product Design, History of ID, and Design Collab. He is extremely knowledgeable you WILL learn alot. Expect to work hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering	540	1	1	2	3	835392	5/22/11	It seems the past raters have already mentioned what I wanted to say. To be honest I feel as if I didn't learn anything in his class. He just reiterates what's in the textbook and doesn't add to the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering	361	2	2	1	4	835392	11/13/10	Possibly the worst teacher I have had at RIT. Grades extremely harshly, criticizes students for asking relevant questions, does not answer some questions at all when asked and teaches from slides taken directly from the text book. Grades your project on the presentation which he picks apart as you try to present. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering	540	2	1	2	2	835392	4/6/08	Can't pronounce common SE words like "component" (among others), but grades more harshly on presentation than content. Teaches directly from the book. If it's a choice between Reddy and a crappy schedule, take the crappy schedule. AVOID LIKE THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering	420	1	1	2	5	835392	1/13/11	Horrible professor. Offers little to no help, and a very harsh grader. The only professor I know that will look for the lowest of two grades and use them. Very hard tests (almost blind sides you when compared to examples he uses). NEVER TAKE A CLASS HE TEACHES
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	835392	10/2/10	Easily the worst professor I've had at RIT. He grades unreasonably harsh and often ridicules students for asking questions. His teaching style consists of nothing more than reading from stock PowerPoint slides. On the first day he told us not to buy the textbook, but then assigned weekly problems from it. Avoid him if you want to actually learn SE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yedduladoddi Reddy	1.4	0	Engineering	362	2	2	1	2	835392	12/1/06	Very bad teacher. Gave poor explanations and ridiculed students when they presented.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	0	Economics		1	1	1	1	478759	1/15/11	His tests are difficult and the Material covered on classes is useless for tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	1	Economics	211	1	2	4	3	478759	4/26/10	I began this class thinking it would be great. I was wrong. Redlo is a great lecturer, but his tests are extremely hard. There are only 4, 25 multiple choice test which you think would be great until you do poorly on one of them. No other chances to do well. It was also a 4 hour class and he let us out after 2 1/2 hours. Waste of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics	211	4	4	5	5	478759	7/24/09	Awesome teacher, he made class fun and interesting. Grade was based on 4, 25 multiple test questions, it is extremely hard to get A's on them even when he allows a cheat sheet, but he gave 5 extra points to your final grade. I definitely recomend to take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		4	5	4	2	478759	2/17/09	writes all notes on board all exams are multiple choice. 25 questions he gives you 4 of them. so they are all your grade and there is a 5% bonus participation grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics	402	1	5	5	3	478759	4/30/08	Obviously this class is going to be hard, it's macroeconomics! The class and the tests were difficult, but again, that's macro for you. Redlo has a way of making you want to learn the material and get good at it. Take him. Seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		2	4	5	4	478759	11/12/07	Mitchell redlo is the man, What a cool guy. His class was dificult for me, that being said I really learned a lot from him. He is very knowledgable on econ and has a lot of experience teaching. His class was based on 4 tests, if you're good at taking tests, this is the class for you, otherwise...good luck. I looked forward to class everyday.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		5	5	5	5	478759	11/17/05	His classes are SO EEASSSY, it's ridiculous... Take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		4	5	5	2	478759	8/13/05	This guy is really great. The take home tests were really hard so I recommend taking the class with a bunch of your buddies so you can do it together. I got in this class when I didnt buy the book and sorta kinda didnt pay attention in class. Show up for class though and do not turn in late work. He is kinda touchy about that. I actually learned 2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	1	Economics		2	3	3	4	478759	5/10/05	I'm a smart student, I come to class everyday, I pay attention and take notes. Almost everyone passes his class with an A, but I got a D. The tests are RIDICULOUS. Don't take it, thinking the take home tests will help you get an A. Because you'll be dissapointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		4	5	5	1	478759	10/25/04	He is a great teacher. 4 test all take home with a week to work on them. He explains the material well, answers all questions, and makes it so economics is bearably. I got an A (I hate the subject). One catch: Show up for class. Its 4 hours long but he lets you out an hour early.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	1	Economics	402	2	3	3	3	478759	6/14/10	Class grade is based on four 20 multiple choice tests, no homeworks. He presents the material clearly, but some of the questions on tests are tricky. He keeps the class light, and has a sarcastic sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	0	Economics	292	2	2	2	1	478759	8/26/09	Class consists of four multiple choice questions and that's it. I wish there were more opportunities to raise your grade but there weren't. Redlo teaches the subject so matter-of-factly that I'm pretty sure he skipped some parts that would help students learn more. Uses same exams every class so seek out someone who has taken it before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics	211	1	4	5	3	478759	4/29/09	Very good at teaching. Easy to understand. His humor is mostly funny but sometimes creepy. His test are extremely hard and unexpected from how he teaches in class. It is possible to pass but you need to have a very good understanding of micro.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		2	5	5	4	478759	2/4/09	Redlo is fantastic...I would love to buy this guy a beer someday. His tests can be hard, and you need to go to class to do well, but he makes class fun. 4 credit hours, lets you go after 2.5 each class. Great guy, must take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics	211	4	5	5	5	478759	4/14/08	GREAT! He is VERY knowledgable in Economics and keeps your attention. His lectures were very detailed. I learned A LOT from him. The tests are all multiple choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		5	4	5	2	478759	7/22/07	Your grade depends upon the sum of 4 25 point test spread through the quarter. If you do the reading you'll understand better, but I never did and did just fine. The class is about 4 hours long but he keeps you entertained throughout the whole period. You get a break too. If he thinks he didn't cover enough, he'll give you the points for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		4	5	5	4	478759	10/25/05	Very helpful, provides lots of examples, and has very intiguing lecture style. I learned more from this man than any other prof I've ever had. Am planning on taking him for Macro-econ next term.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	1	Economics	111	1	3	3	5	478759	6/27/05	this class is ridiculous and the most hARD EVER. who made up microecominics? :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mitchell Redlo	4.1	2	Economics		5	5	5	1	478759	1/6/05	all take home tests account for your grade, no hmwk or in class tests.. how easy is that?! i'd recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication	535	3	4	5	4	205707	5/19/11	Had her for Professional Communication for Business. Really enjoyed the class! Professor led great discussions and individual/group projects were very constructive. Very nice professor, enjoys teaching the business students--recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		3	5	4	3	205707	11/28/10	She's an amazing teacher. She let's students run the class (sometimes) while keeping us on track. Very friendly and helpful. Her tests aren't too bad -- use her study guides (they are life savers).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication	501	4	5	5	4	205707	5/15/10	I learned a lot about public speaking from her class. The textbook was referenced on the exams, and the study guides helped focus on what we should know. She was a fair grader, and her class was engaging. I would highly recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		5	3	4	4	205707	11/19/09	Too easy. Show up, listen to the obvious things she says. Do you speech and get an A. Super nice lady and easy grader. Biggest thing is just show up. We had a lot of laughs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication	101	5	1	1	3	205707	9/29/09	She is the worst teacher in the entire world. Every class she just talks to you like you are an idiot and states the obvious of everything. One class she talks about communication with power point and mistakes not to make, but she makes all of the mistakes herself. Maybe she should take her own class so she could improve her speaking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	1	Communication		3	3	3	3	205707	4/27/09	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication		4	2	2	3	205707	2/14/09	Way too reliant on textbook. Expects ridiculous amount of reading and attention to detail. Grades arbitrarily and takes off points for things the assignment isn't testing. Tests range from very hard to very easy. Be prepared. Lots of work for a self-explanatory class. Expect personal rambling and not a lot of productivity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication	501	5	4	3	3	205707	11/5/08	Simple professor, easy to talk to and understand but also has assignments that are both easy enough to do but difficult enough to not get a super easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication		3	2	2	1	205707	10/22/07	She's an illogical grader: she grades on certain things that she expects, but aren't included in the assignment sheet. Very strict in grading on exactly what she expects (such as using Roman Numerals instead of A, B, C, etc.) even if it's irrelevant to the content.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		4	4	4	4	205707	6/27/05	The class was easy going. You had to write some papers and projects, but they weren't brain busters. She's a really nice teacher and related well with the students. We didn't always have 2 hour classes either, which was a plus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		3	4	4	1	205707	1/25/11	Nice teacher overall. Can be a little strict with schedule and criteria. Would definitely recommend her for Public Speaking over other teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication	351	4	1	2	3	205707	5/24/10	For prof comm for SE, she is the only professor so taking her is inevitable. I got an A in her class, but she is a terrible professor. Takes forever to grade assignments and her grading is pretty iffy. If you ever have a choice, I would recommend taking a different professor. If you are stuck with her, getting a good grade is possible though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		5	4	5	2	205707	12/1/09	Reeves changed her syllabus to include half of the class online making things much more enjoyable. I found the textbook very helpful and the lectures interesting. It was a class geared towards getting a job. Class consisted of weekly quizzes, discussions and various business documents.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		2	5	5	4	205707	11/18/09	I don't know why people here don't rate her well. She was very clear in her lectures, funny, and gave great feedback. If you are lazy you won't do well, but she rewards your attention and participation. Just make a good effort and try to improve each time and whether you are a good speaker or not you will do great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication	351	3	1	2	3	205707	5/27/09	This should have been an easy class, but Reeves is terrible. She barely explained anything, and wouldn't even answer questions as to why something was wrong. I would recommend avoiding her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		4	4	4	4	205707	4/26/09	This is a great class. The atmosphere is great. There are only 3 speeches that are given. Informative, persuasive and commemorative. The first half of the course is about learning how to deliver a speech. The second half is presenting the speech. She is a fair grader, and is very approachable. Book is required, I got through without reading a page.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication		5	4	4	2	205707	11/12/08	Depends too much on the book and expects two speeches during the quarter. Can be very strict and serious with grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication	351	4	3	4	3	205707	11/25/07	Reeves was alright. I thought she was easy, but I'm the only one I've talked to that got an A in her Communications class. The homework is infrequent and easy. Exams are fairly difficult and very detail-oriented. Not bad, but nothing special...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	0	Communication		3	2	1	2	205707	11/9/05	Just talked about her brother and aim the whole time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	1	Communication		5	3	3	NULL	205707	5/27/04	Best Professor at RIT. Not because of her teaching style, but because she is HOT. Plus, four hour classes are suddenly two hours! Did I mention how hot she is yet?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	2	Communication	101	3	5	5	NULL	205707	10/9/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Reeves	3.3	1	Communication		4	3	2	NULL	205707	5/6/03	She was fun, but didnt have much control of the class. She had no idea about the schedule of the class and kept getting mixed up. Her tests were hard though and she didnt give much in the way of a review.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	362	3	5	4	5	229716	5/27/09	He is a good professor, but the class was bad. He explains things well when asked to, but otherwise just briefly goes over the material. He is a fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	350	4	4	4	4	229716	2/28/09	Good professor. Very personable with his students and always willing to help out on all assignments required for the class. In addition, a very fair grader in terms of the practicums (if everyone did bad on one of them, he would allow a resubmission to get half points back).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	350	4	5	4	4	229716	2/23/08	Reichlmayr gets a positive soley on the fact that he is very personable with his students and really wants to see them all succeed. His lectures are a little boring, but he's a nice grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	350	4	5	5	5	229716	1/30/07	Brilliant Professor. He is definately one of the best professors in the department, if you get the chance to take him, you should. He is a fair grader (I got a 104 on the first exam for crying out loud) and takes things at a pace that is managable for most people.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	229716	4/1/06	Good guy, helpful and cares about students. He didn't get as involved as I would have liked in helping us resolve an issue with a troublesome team member throughout the quarter, but he did help us try to handle it ourselves and we got good grades (not sure about the other team member, though). Take his class if you have the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	229716	5/2/04	This guy is cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	229716	7/13/03	He is very friendly and always willing to help; he is an enjoyable professor who encourages questions and makes hard material fun to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	456	4	4	4	4	229716	5/16/09	Good professor. He was provided useful feedback on questions brought up in class. Reasonable workload. The only issue I had was that some of the lectures did not appear to be that useful because the material was already stated in the required reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	101	4	5	4	5	229716	11/17/08	I was very pleased with the first weeks of class, thought he did a good job of presenting the material (even if it didn't matter for the course). Nice guy, but not great if looking for constructive feedback.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering	101	5	5	5	5	229716	11/6/07	Very nice, helpful, clear to understand. Knows what he's talking about. Makes the subject interesting. Highly recommended professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	229716	7/26/06	Awesome professor; I take him every chance I get because he's really good at making boring material fun and easy to learn. He's also friendly and generally available and helpful outside of class and during his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		4	5	5	3	229716	8/12/05	He actually cares about his students; as such he is very helpful and generally available in his office to take questions related to class and even those that aren't. He explains things well and doesn't assume that everyone knows what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Reichlmayr	4.7	2	Engineering		5	5	5	NULL	229716	4/27/04	Took this guy cause he was the only one left, very glad i did. He is a nice approchable guy, and a pretty easy grader. He made the SE experience much better than any I have heard from people who have previously taken the course with others
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	1	Computer Science		2	3	3	1	251452	4/9/13	Took for PLC, do not recommend. Lectures are meaningless, tests are brutally specific. Projects are simple but very poorly explained both because instructions are unclear and because he doesn't teach the material required. Prepare to spend a lot of time in his office or exchanging emails, which he can take a day to respond back to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	4	251452	5/17/12	Goes off on long tangents/unrelated anecdotes. Clearly knows the material, but seems to sometimes have a hard time actually explaining the concepts. Tests are brutal. Absolutely brutal. Projects/labs are a good grade buffer, though. Overall would recommend him if you want to learn, but not if you want an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	0	Computer Science	485	1	1	2	3	251452	7/7/11	Unhelpful analogies, tangents, skimming over slides, no coding exercises before tests or project, heavy on the theory, low on the syntax but tests are all SQL/XML/relational algebra syntax, surprise graded activities, mandatory graded surveys, tested on project material, you are expected to write project in 3 weeks. Grade is Tests: 50% Project: 40%
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	251452	1/11/11	Very helpful and understanding, medium skill set but ready to experiment with new trends in CS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	251452	12/26/05	Professor Raj is an all around good professor. He is clear and you will understand the material. His tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention. I would recommend him for DBC.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	0	Computer Science	772	5	3	1	NULL	251452	9/19/03	Simply horrible. If you DON'T WANT TO LEARN A WORD, TAKE HIM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	1	Computer Science		3	2	3	3	251452	12/2/12	Do not take him if you want to learn something. I got nothing out of his lectures. Was a waste of my money and time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	4	251452	11/22/11	Seriously, don't take him if you really want to learn something in database. His grading is mostly related to how many times you meet him in his office outside the class. Doesn't discuss any coding at all, doesn't even look at your codes for the project. Teaches from PPT slides only. You'll learn more from books and Google than anything from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	251452	1/11/11	Got to learn a lot, he guides you through the course and we get to do major part.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	0	Computer Science	771	1	1	1	1	251452	10/29/10	Folks, If you value your money never take him. I was surprised at his lack of knowledge and in defense he said "This is a grad course, you dont expect me to know everything", duh?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rajendra Raj	2.8	2	Computer Science		5	4	3	5	251452	10/12/04	He's pretty easy, and if you already know what you're doing, I highly recommend him. He's got the clearest accent of any of the Indian professors except maybe Teredesai. If you're shaky on material though, avoid. You won't learn enough from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering	360	1	1	1	1	216172	2/21/08	Don't take anything with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering	702	1	1	1	4	216172	10/11/06	he is not meant to be a Teacher.He came just to show what he knows,nothing helpfull for students.In my life ,I never had a professor like this.I was an above ave student all the time.but his class is deppressing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering	711	1	1	1	1	216172	8/3/06	too tough to handle
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		3	1	1	4	216172	5/23/05	Agree with all comments above. He can be really really unfair with grading sometimes.....esp if you use grammar that he cant understand. Dont bother going to ask for help......ask some other proffesor they are more likely to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	216172	3/10/05	Yeah circuits 1 and I got a C. I'm now in MS/BS. I hate this guy. Easily my worst EE course at RIT. I went to see him for help and he told me I was stupid. He's not only rude and unhelpful but an aweful teacher. Do anything to avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	216172	12/5/04	worst teacher. If u have a question he'll tell u to read the book...and if u read the book he doesn't care
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	2	Engineering		2	2	5	NULL	216172	5/26/03	Good knowledge. Has a bad temper, Not helpful or Approachable. But very organised. You can get A's if you are not put off by him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		3	2	1	3	216172	1/23/08	Be prepared to teach yourself from the book as his lectures are incomprehensible and very unorganized. However the text is pretty helpful and he only tests on the basics of each section so tests and quizzes aren't too hard. Overall, not the most fun class but if you apply yourself you should get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		2	1	1	5	216172	8/13/06	brutal
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		1	1	1	5	216172	5/8/06	This man is easily one of the worst teachers at RIT, in fact he is the worst teacher I have ever had. The material is easy but he makes it his highest priority to make it as hard as he can. His Tests and quizes are extremely hard, and are completely unreasonable. I spent 10-12hrs studying for them and never got higher than a 70. DONT TAKE HIM!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	1	Engineering		2	2	4	5	216172	4/27/05	Strict grading on homework, I knew material before course, yet the highest HW grade I ever got was a 70%. 90 or 100% on all exams/quizes. If you know the stuff the class is easy. If not, perhaps you would want another professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	216172	2/27/05	HMM... Let's just say this,,,, horrible teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sannasi Ramanan	1.5	1	Engineering		2	1	4	NULL	216172	3/1/04	I agree with the comments above
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale  Ranck	1.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	1792242	1/29/13	This is his first time teaching. He doesn't understand what to teach to students. He reads off the slides and doesn't come up with his own notes. Doesn't do enough examples in class. Very ambiguous when it comes down to solving a problem. Avoid taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dale  Ranck	1.2	0	Engineering		1	1	2	3	1792242	1/29/13	He does not know how to teach. Reads off slides given to him by better professors. Avoid at all costs.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	1	500254	2/23/13	Awful professor, very unhelpful. I'm glad I passed this class and am done with it. Worst professor I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	1	Fine Arts		2	2	3	3	500254	1/24/12	he kind of has a split personality. In lecture he's funny and pretty easy to talk to, but in crit he can be extremely harsh without giving any reasoning for it. If you try hard he will recognize that you're putting in effort. I ended up with 99.6% in the class, but it took a ton of work. You will be shooting a lot and at least one project per week.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	2	Fine Arts	202	4	5	4	3	500254	10/31/10	I took this class without having any interest in pj. I think it's annoying, but he loves it and as long as you do the work and improve somewhat you get decent grades. Missing class isn't smart, but he's not too strict. Compared to owen butler.. doug rea is WAY better. He atleast critics your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	500254	8/30/05	best prof ever
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	0	Fine Arts	101	2	1	1	1	500254	5/2/12	Worst teacher I have had at RIT. Unhelpful and not constructive at all. Gives the most awful and mundane assignments and is serious in crit and very difficult. His lecture times are pointless, but attendance is necessary. His lab time: also pointless. He expects you to skip other classes and responsibilities for his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	2	Fine Arts	251	3	5	5	1	500254	12/6/11	Had Doug and no interest in PJ then loved it! Hes GREAT! Funny guy but expects to see your work- if you don't try he will call you out. Hes super fun though and class is never boring. Doug is the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	0	Fine Arts	101	1	1	1	3	500254	10/12/10	Hands down worst professor I've had at RIT. His grading methods don't make sense. He does allow you to reshoot projects, but he doesn't tell you how to improve your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Doug Rea	3.2	2	Fine Arts	302	3	5	5	3	500254	11/16/04	This has to be the coolest guy ever. has a crazy sense of humor, great uncle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1403402	5/21/12	if you show up to class and do the short, VERY SHORT, assignments, you are guaranteed an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1403402	5/3/11	Robyn is such a nice and engaging professor. She makes what could be a really boring class really fun and worth while. She has great advice on life and will help you with your resume if you ask her. Super fun and easy class, take it with her if you can. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1403402	11/5/10	she is a nice FYE teacher. The class is a breeze to begin with but its nice to have a teacher who is engaging and doesn't just make you wish you slept in
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1403402	2/24/12	Best pathways teacher. Will make the experience not only painless, but nearly non-existent. This is the professor you want.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	1403402	11/21/10	Makes what could be a waste of time fun to attend. She allowed us to discuss things that interested us, instead of making us stay on topic. Also assigned easy assignments based off of our major and actually cares about the students in the class. Has good advice for career interviews (she was a career counselor before).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robyn Reafler	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1403402	2/25/10	Robyn Reafler is the nicest FYE teacher in this campus. Assignments are easy, and there are only about five or six during the entire quarter. Take FYE with her!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andy Reddout	5.0	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	590119	8/31/05	Awesome class. Awesome prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Redinger	4.4	2	Chemical Engineering		5	5	5	3	1690178	5/2/12	Jenifer is an excellent teacher. Granted that she teaches FYE and Pathways the courses are a BREEZE. She's very passionate about service and easy to talk to. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASS FOR A GOOD TIME.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Redinger	4.4	2	Chemical Engineering		5	3	4	1	1690178	2/8/12	She is very perky and sensitive. Will prefer the students with emotional issues over the normal ones. Class is easy, but she is not an instructor you want, you'll be annoyed every time you see her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Redinger	4.4	2	Chemical Engineering		5	4	4	4	1690178	2/22/12	Very loud and upbeat. She can be a little too much to handle sometimes, but overall is a very nice person who loves what she does. I found her very easy to talk to, and she was very easy to please. No peer evaluations, so good if you're a slacker and bad if end up carrying the group.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Redinger	4.4	2	Chemical Engineering		4	5	5	3	1690178	1/30/12	She truly loves what she does and is easy to become friends with. High energy and has tons of personal stories to tell. If you can handle her upbeat personality, she is totally worth having, and makes FYE classes more bearable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Reek	4.1	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	111710	10/14/05	Tough as nails, smarter than hell. If you were up for a 10 week sprint, he was your guy. Fun, interesting, but probably the toughest professor at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Reek	4.1	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	NULL	111710	3/9/03	If you want to learn more alot, and are willing to do the work, take his class. If you want to coast through the class, not do any work, and still get an A, take someone else. If you deserve the A, you'll get it. One of the best professors at RIT.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Reek	4.1	2	Computer Science		1	4	4	NULL	111710	6/11/03	Hard teacher, thankfully retired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Reek	4.1	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	NULL	111710	2/26/03	Demands perfection, but teaches perfection. He puts in more time before every class than any professor I know. His motivation for teaching, and his extreme knowledeg make for a great learning environment.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science	775	3	5	5	3	1189420	4/11/13	The course begins easy but it slowly catches up. So, if you are not keeping up, you can fall behind. He is great in explaining things. If you want to learn, take Data Mining only from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science	775	2	5	5	4	1189420	10/10/12	I was initially planning to specialize in a different area. I took Rege for the Database class and then ended up taking all the Data Management courses from him, simply because of the way he teaches. As a result, I decided to specialize in Data Management. He is awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	3	1189420	10/1/11	One of the nicest professors I have ever had. Wish I could take him for all my classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	1	Computer Science	775	2	1	4	4	1189420	9/14/10	He is great. I learned a lot from the class. He is very approachable. Me and some of my buddies often met him after class too and he was always helpful. I'd recommend him anytime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	5	1189420	12/3/09	PROS: Intelligent, listens, answers questions, jokes sometimes, easy to talk to. CONS: very boring PowerPoint lectures, unpredictable material on tests. SUMMARY: If you are familiar with the material, his class should be easy for you. Otherwise, you will probably not learn much, and definitely not remember much, after the class. (Data Mining)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science	771	4	5	4	4	1189420	11/2/08	Excellent Professor. Very knowledgeable, and helpful.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	1189420	12/18/11	I took CS2 from him. I had struggled in CS1 (taken from another prof) and was worried how I would do in CS2. Rege was great. Not did he help me understand CS1 fundamentals but also helped me a lot during CS2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science	775	2	5	4	3	1189420	9/8/11	I took him for Data Mining. Learned a lot. He makes you work hard, but a great prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science		4	3	4	2	1189420	12/4/09	GREAT Prof. Learned a lot. 3 tests with the avg. scores in the B Range, 4 very easy and useful hw assignments, 1 fun and easy project, 1 presentation and 1 final. Tests = 30%, HW = 10%, Project = 20%, Presentation = 10%, Final = 30%. Grades are curved at the end of the quarter so most people walk out with an A even if they should of had a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	2	Computer Science	771	5	5	5	5	1189420	11/2/08	Take him if you really wanna learn something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Manjeet Rege	4.1	0	Computer Science	101	2	2	2	3	1189420	10/21/08	He is easy if you have had atleast a year background in java. Very tough if you are new.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Repka	2.8	2	Electrical Engineering		5	2	5	2	1256265	2/7/13	This professor is really easy...he's an adjunct so it was hard to ever meet with him outside of class (other than the weekends). I didn't know anything at all going in, and even though the class was as boring as all hell, i was still able to follow it and get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Repka	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering	340	2	3	2	1	1256265	3/7/10	This class was pretty easy but I don't feel like I learned anything. Computer architecture is still a mystery to me and for all I know, pixies and fairies are inside my tower allowing me to write this review on the internet. Lectures are very boring and taking notes is worthless. You're better off reading the powerpoints to yourself on a laptop.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Repka	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering	340	4	3	2	2	1256265	2/16/11	As the others have said just read the textbook and slides since his lectures consist of him directly reading off of the slides. The only good I see is that he responds to emails and returns grades promptly. It would be better if his class was half lecture half workshop and no homeworks or weigh homeworks less than they are now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Repka	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering	340	3	3	2	3	1256265	2/28/09	Not too good of a professor. His lectures are near useless, so you'll need to rely on the book to get by in this class. He does promptly return graded assignments though and provides useful reviews before exams. If he would shift his lectures more toward a workshop format, I think he would be a far better professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Retallack	3.0	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	4	681049	10/21/08	Class is all about portraiture - which can be good or bad. He is willing to listen to you and talk to you about your work more than other teachers. He can't hear well, but don't be an ass and talk during his class because he can't hear you - the other students can and they want to hear what he's saying! I produced great work under his teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Retallack	3.0	1	Fine Arts		3	3	2	4	681049	2/1/06	bleh... it is very hard to figure out how john grades... and i hope you like portraiture... and make sure to speak up
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	1185289	4/9/13	He was a TERRIBLE teacher. He will take off points for any reason, even if you obviously show you know the topic. His class structure is a pain in the ass: daily assignments in class, daily assignments online, and weekly assignments. Awful. Please avoid this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	322	2	1	2	2	1185289	2/20/13	Probably the worst teacher I have had. The day before the final he took the notes offline and no one was able to study. Avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1185289	11/13/12	Really teaches the fundamentals, which helps with all subsequent data classes. He may be stricter than the other professors but his style is easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	320	1	1	1	3	1185289	8/9/12	Professor Reynolds did not know how to teach if it wasn't for his teaching assistant none of us would have made it through his class. The assistant basically had to reteach everything after class. It was all wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	320	1	1	1	4	1185289	2/1/12	Avoid at all costs! My class's homework average is consistently a 51%. He is only interest in showing you how much he knows, your learning is completely irrelevant to him. There is a definite reason he was suspended three years ago, and they should have never hired him back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	1185289	11/30/11	THIS GUY IS AWFUL! I could not understand anything in class, his teaching skills are horrible. I would always email him to get one on one help and he would NEVER respond. Whenever I went into his office there were always 5 other people in there trying to get help as well. VERY DIFFICULT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	319	1	1	1	1	1185289	4/20/11	HORRIBLE, Worst teacher I have ever had here. Grades horribly, takes off for random things without explanation. Everyone fails test/quiz. NOT FUNNY AT ALL (thinks he is). Makes assignments due at 4:00 exactly and takes off of 4:01. DO NOT TAKE EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES unless you want to teach yourself the whole class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	2	1185289	3/16/11	TERRIBLE pacing. No slides. Inarticulate test questions. Terrible review for quizzes/tests. Hard grading. Requires online homework. Requires lab-computer only work. Both are irritating and would better on paper. Answers questions- but expect to ask about *EVERY* *SINGLE* *EXAMPLE*. Complete waste of time- take it with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	1185289	1/4/11	I feel he is seriously one of the worst professors i have ever had with 6 months before graduation. Blows through material and does not post relevant stuff online. He is not funny in the least, but will drag jokes for (5-10) minutes during class. Avoid at all costs, he just got his masters.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	1	1185289	10/21/10	i'm taking his DA1 class right now. i'm serious he is a bad teacher. everyone fails his tests and quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		4	1	2	2	1185289	3/3/13	He looks for reasons to fail students. Not helpful or understanding at all. 30 seconds late with turning assignments into class he will not accept your work. Even if the clock in class in wrong. If there Is a Fire drill during an exam- he will expect you to finish the exam and not curve it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	1185289	1/16/13	At first he seems like a decent guy. But he hates to be wrong, he hates to explain things so you can understand them, and he hates to be helpful. I am always really fair to rating professors, but this guy is seriously one of the worst RIT has to offer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	319	2	2	2	2	1185289	10/1/12	He's a good person, but his teaching skills are awful. He teaches extremely fast, almost never takes a breath, and leaves the class feeling confused. You never do class work, if you want explanations you need to go to the group "office hours" right after class which conflict with nearly everyone's schedule. Avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	1185289	5/6/12	Seems to be a good person but TERRIBLE teacher! Do not take him unless you absolutely have to! He leaves things out in his lectures and then makes them worth heavy points in quizzes/tests. Grades very harshly for no real reason. Homework objectives are unclear and harshly graded.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	1185289	1/29/12	Very nice guy, his jokes are so bad they are funny, but sometimes they actually help you learn. He is very helpful and available and will even stay after class to talk. He presented the material clearly and organized. He allows you to bring a note sheet for tests. I am good at math so this was an easy class for me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	1185289	5/12/11	I don't understand all of the hatred for this guy. I had him for data 1 and he presented the material VERY clearly, graded fairly, and made the class about as interesting as it could be. Easy A if you show up and do your homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	1185289	3/30/11	By far the worst prof. I have ever had. I am in his class right now. Be thankful of online HW. As his grading is TOUGHER than the online assignments. I dont think he curves grades but he should, no one seems to do well. I don't know whats worse is teaching or his jokes, but both are horrible. DO NOT! Take his classes, under any circumstances.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	1	1	1185289	1/12/11	Terrible, I only took his class because it fit my schedule and it was one of the worst mistakes of my life. I was constantly going for extra help and he would just make me more confused. He nit-picked absolutely everything with his grading. I would avoid him at all costs if you want to pass Data I.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	1	1185289	12/9/10	Assigns 3 homeworks a week, and actually punishes students for mistakes he makes. Is not nearly as funny as he thinks he is. Why do math professors insist on online homework? Its the dumbest thing. Just hand me a paper with the problems on it. Stop being lazy and actually grade the work you assign. If its the department's fault, RIT math sucks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	1	1185289	7/28/10	I took Data II with this professor last year and got a B. I'm typically weak in math and have to work really hard at it. It's a tough class but you have to pay attention and ask questions. I had no trouble asking for help and even felt free to seek help during his office hours. No excuse for not asking for help when he's so available and nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	320	1	1	2	1	1185289	7/8/10	Wanted to take the class over the summer to get it over and done with. 5 weeks in and I'm failing the course. I made a B in Data I and I'm an Honors Student. This man just cannot teach. He believes students should understand the material the first time. I didn't feel comfortable asking for help. I had to withdraw. Tra was supposed to teach not him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	1	1185289	2/17/10	do the homework. ask questions. don't screw around during lecture.. ASK QUESTIONS. very organized, will work with you and repeat all of the material and restate information different ways until you get it. Good prof if YOU communicate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	2	1	1	1185289	1/30/09	DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH, expect to teach yourself the material if you want to pass the class, I completed and had 100 on every homework assignment, failed 1 test and received an academic alert because I was failing the class and had to withdraw.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	1185289	10/15/08	Cannot teach so you end up teaching yourself from the textbook. Also goes far to fast the other classes have only done two thirds to half of what we have covered.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics	320	4	5	4	3	1185289	7/5/10	I found the class to be relatively easy. If I had any questions, he was able to answer them. The classes usually didn't run the full 110 minutes. He does place an unnecessary emphasis on formatting though. Even though I understood everything on the tests, I would still get 10-15 points off due to formatting. He allowed a page of notes on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics	101	1	1	2	3	1185289	2/25/09	Well besides the content normally being fairly easy. His teaching style is horrid, and do not look at the practice tests they will hurt you more than help. Makes tests extremely hard. Avoid like AIDS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	3	1185289	10/27/08	The class is really easy if you've taken calc in highschool, if not, pay attention and do your homework. Seriously, if you take the time to study the material it isn't really that hard. Gives a formula sheet during exams and doesn't expect problems to be reduced; if you can keep up, you'll do ok.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	3	1185289	10/8/08	Very bad teacher doesn't know how to teach. I agree he's smart guy but he cant explain anything I had to withdraw from the class because I would have an F in the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Donald Reynolds	2.2	1	Mathematics	201	1	2	4	2	1185289	10/7/08	Hardest grader you've ever seen. He just got his Masters a few months ago and thinks he knows it all. Nice guy but take exactly Zero feedback from the students. Does examples fast and only once and expects you to remember it all. Self taught class unless you always know it. I took it for an easy A and I'm failing. Avoid like the plague!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Leonid Reznik	3.0	0	Computer Science	455	3	2	2	3	1597109	7/7/11	His accent is hard to understand and he skips over slides a lot. 1/2 of your lectures will not happen - you will be told to stay home and take an online test. The test key is incorrect and I think 1 kid got an A on test 2, that's it. The project has incredibly vague specifications. What isn't an online test, he grades super leniently. Weird guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Leonid Reznik	3.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	3	3	1597109	6/4/07	Its rare to find a professor that both knows his material and is understanding with his students availability to do intensive projects and course work. (Usually the professor knows his material, and tries to cram every bit of it down the throats of his students in a very very short time that is 10 weeks). Small language barrier, but otherwisegreat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		2	4	5	5	66033	2/11/13	I only had him for half the quarter and he was wonderful. He is an awesome teacher that just gets your attention and he is super clear. His test aren't the easiest, but I actually learned in his class and he kept me awake!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		1	5	4	4	66033	3/16/12	Very good at teaching the material, but tests and HWs are extremely difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	369	2	5	5	4	66033	2/10/11	Excellent professor, very clear, and helpful. His tests and homework can be extremely difficult but if you take the time and go over his notes you shouldn't have a problem. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	374	2	5	5	5	66033	8/6/10	Had him for Special Relativity, University I and Modern Lab I. He is the MAN. He will call you out at random, so you better know your material if you don't want to feel terrible. Even if you know, he'll still crush you. Explains things simply and interestingly, yet you still get a thorough (and sometimes advanced beyond other classes) understanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	311	3	5	5	4	66033	3/1/10	Definitely the best physics prof at RIT. kind of hard but extremely interesting. i looked forward to every class and they went quickly. loves planets, rockets, and examples with death in them. very helpful. hw is interesting and not too long. tests are hard but it balances out in the end. easy quizzes are 2% bonus on your final grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	0	Science	101	4	2	2	5	66033	11/4/09	Not a bad professor teaching-wise, but very mean/arrogant. Loves to put students on the spot and make them look stupid. Example: asks a student to provide an equation; while they look through their notes he immediately writes the equation on the board, so everyone laughs at you. Very hard to concentrate when being laughed it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	1	Science	312	2	2	4	4	66033	11/8/07	Very interesting lectures, he always held my interest and I learned a lot. Extremely strict grader tough and not very fair. I switched in late and was not allowed to make up work, thus dropping a letter grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	5	66033	2/3/05	After having Dr Richmond for Physics 1, I purposely rearranged my schedule so that I could have him for Physics 2 and waited a semester to see if he would be teaching Physics 3. Class was interesting, especially since I got to participate in almost every demo (Jackie Chan, Mr. Bicep) - a great prof
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		2	4	3	4	66033	1/31/05	Awesome guy, really tries to convince you the concepts. His homework is tough, but if you sit down and take the time to do it, it's no problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	1	Science		1	2	3	NULL	66033	5/26/03	He is nerdy all right. He seems to have a good grasp on Physics but he makes exams too hard. He doesn't give partial credit on HW's as its done online and he doesn't grade them.Quite animated while giving lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	200	4	5	5	4	66033	10/1/12	Funny
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	5	66033	11/12/11	The best professor I've ever had. Clear, focused, interesting lectures. Really likes what he does and it shows. Respects students but you'll lose that by sleeping in class / not showing up / interrupting class. Take if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	200	3	4	5	3	66033	1/21/11	Had him for special relativity and UP Ia he is an excellent teacher and is very knowledgeable when it comes to physics and how to teach it. He is funny, his classes aren't easy A's. and he dislikes stupidity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	311	2	5	4	3	66033	3/7/10	I had heard Richmond was the best Physics professor at RIT and when I saw he wasn't teaching University I this quarter, I was really bummed. Boy was I surprised when he walked into class on day one when I had registered for a different teacher. His class was awesome! That said, the tests are very hard and it can be a struggle sometimes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	200	3	4	4	5	66033	2/23/10	Awesome professor, makes great jokes during class. His lectures are very interesting. I enjoyed every single one and looked forward to them. They were thought-provoking. There are occasional pop-quizzes to make sure you're glancing ahead to preview the next class, which honestly helped. Two tests, midterm and final. Willing to help clarify points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science	200	2	5	4	4	66033	10/9/08	Dr. Richmond is awesome, nothing more needs to be said about him. He teaches in a way that makes you want to learn the material (otherwise he'll embarrass you), and even if you know the material he makes fun of you. This keeps the material interesting... and truly keeps you engaged in class. Plus he's a good looki' individual.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	1	Science	311	1	3	2	3	66033	3/11/07	just barely went over material in class, homework nearly impossible. Labs helped me learn the material, very effective. Tests impossible. Final absolutely impossible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	2	66033	2/1/05	nice Professor, very helpful, his class is not that easy but he let you learn a lot of stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	0	Science		3	2	2	4	66033	11/27/04	The guy belongs in an elementary school. The way he teaches/talks is the most annoying thing I've ever seen. His tests aren't overly hard, but you have to read his mind. No partial credit. If you are deaf or have another disability expect to be offended at least 1x. Look out for his temper.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Richmond	4.1	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	66033	10/1/02	He is nerdy but entertaining at the same time. He gives nonstandard assignments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	288265	11/30/11	Loved this professor! Such a nice guy. Very funny and entertaining to listen to. Had him for digital foundations. Course is a bit fast paced so good notes and submitting labs on time are very important. Didn't get any grades till end of quarter but he had a family emergency so this probably isn't typical. Ended up with an A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	0	Graphic Arts		3	3	1	4	288265	7/26/11	How you do in his class depends ENTIRELY on if he likes you, regardless of the effor you put in. Brilliant professor and great guy but I can honestly say I?ve never seen someone play favorites more than he does. Also, if you ever break down because of the work load he?ll give you an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	1	Graphic Arts		1	3	2	3	288265	2/8/10	he kind of makes his students feel like they don't know anything. he's a pretty nice guy and definitely knows his stuff, but needs to realize he makes it impossible for us to learn stuff when he goes through it 100 miles a minute.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	5	288265	4/12/09	The best Prof. ever. He is very helpful and understanding.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	3	288265	12/14/04	Great teacher! Very helpful. At times he gets so excited about the subject matter he needs to calm down and talk slower. You can tell when he gets really excited and enthusiastic because he will start to talk with a very slight stutter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	3	NULL	288265	11/16/03	Good teacher, but unclear about projects at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	4	288265	11/18/11	Excellent teacher. He definitely knows his stuff and he knows what he's doing when he's teaching. Great guy too, pretty laid back and keeps humor in the lectures. He grades pretty strict, but the assignments are quite straight forward. Best teacher I've had this quarter by far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	3	288265	10/26/10	Great teacher. Nice guy, relaxed, realistic about how college students are, passionate about the subject. Easily excited. Allows for some assignments to be resubmitted. Talks rather quickly, but will happily repeat what he said if you ask him. Some assignments are a lot of work, but you can clearly see what you're learning and getting out of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	1	Graphic Arts		2	3	2	4	288265	1/30/10	makes everything way harder than it should be. too much work. not a fun time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	288265	11/18/08	Excellent Professor. A little difficult to follow, but if you ask for help or clarification of help, he will drop everything to make sure you understand. Loves what he does, and it shows. Highly reccommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	3	4	2	288265	2/20/06	I've gotten good grades in his classes both times. He's a good teacher, it may be just the material he was teaching is boring. I didn't pay attention fully and still passed.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Riordan	4.2	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	3	NULL	288265	12/2/03	Pretty cool guy. He does his job the best he can. The other teacher was boring, though I showed up to 3 of the classes, I still got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Ristow	4.5	2	Music		5	3	5	3	1380947	5/12/10	Expects a lot of the students, but the only way to NOT get an A is to not show up for rehearsals. Eight rehearsals per quarter. Miss one, it's excused. Miss two, your grade becomes a B. Miss three, and you fail the course. But, really, it's not hard to just show up to rehearsal.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gregory Ristow	4.5	2	Music		4	5	5	5	1380947	12/23/09	He's so charismatic and flamboyant, but he genuinely wants you to perform to the best of your ability. He lays a lot of songs on you at once, but he's very clear of his expectations. I love singing and he makes it fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry	101	1	1	3	1	904007	11/13/08	Class was very boring and fell asleep more than once during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry		2	1	1	4	904007	2/5/07	Waste of time and credits. Dont learn anything, doesnt read the slides before class, or if he did his memory is garbage, pick on.....Dont take tis class with him if you have a choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry		3	1	1	2	904007	11/2/06	Worst professor ever. Doesn not teach anything, and cant even get the power points working half the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	1	904007	10/24/06	Is constantly stumbling over his own words and doesn't seem to understand what he is attempting to teach. all your hw and tests are online, they're not too bad, if you can stay awake. Definately fell asleep quite a few times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry		4	1	2	2	904007	12/3/07	went to about 4 classes because this class is better learned through the book. I got a B by just doing homework and reviewing the information before tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	1	Chemistry	208	3	2	3	2	904007	11/18/06	A nice person, and if you talk to him one on one, you'll realize that he does know chemistry, however, very unsure of himself teaching in front of a large group. Not very helpful in terms of knowing what is going on in the class or what the class procedures are, etc. Prepare to teach yourself
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	1	Chemistry		3	2	3	1	904007	10/26/06	Seems to be a nice guy, but teaches right off a powerpoint that he doesn't even make himself. All tests and homework and pretty much all work done in the class in online, neither of which he makes. It's pretty annoying that he doesn't know what is on his own tests. You'll do better off if you skip his classes to read the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken Robillard	1.8	0	Chemistry	208	3	2	1	3	904007	10/24/06	Ummmmmm. You'll hear that a lot. Doesn't seem to know what he's teaching. Simply reads off a powerpoint. Be prepared to learn on your own. Bring a pillow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature	319	5	3	4	2	85074	2/17/12	Had her for experimental writing (creative writing). She is very easy and the class is an easy A as long as you try and turn things in on time. Use the textbook to clarify anything you don't understand. Class is a bit boring, sometimes we watch movies that are stupid and irrelevant to the course. Got an A, just for showing effort and s
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature		5	4	3	2	85074	11/23/10	Easy A. Try your best and you're fine. Effort is what she looks for, since it's hard to judge creative writing. Do the assignments and turn them timely. I spent at about hour on homework per week. Sometimes what she's looking for is not so clear, ASK her again and she will clarify! Most often she'll say stuff twice anyways.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	0	Literature	502	5	1	1	1	85074	12/1/09	Had it for Writing Seminar. Hated the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature		5	4	4	2	85074	3/11/09	Not really much goes on in class, but if you keep up with the online work and at least make an attempt you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	0	Literature	319	2	1	3	1	85074	10/25/08	You never are sure of your grade until the end of the quarter. She doesn't comment on your work unless it's really good or really bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature	319	5	4	4	3	85074	1/30/07	Took her Arts of Expression: Experiments and Explorations. She's the kind of teacher who means well, and isn't too hard to get on her good side. Everyone started the class with an 85 average (good or bad depending on how you look at it) No final exam, we only had 1 quiz. Weekly reading and writing assignments from the book.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	0	Literature	227	5	1	1	3	85074	11/3/10	WRITING SEM. Professor can't hear, can't hear a word, waste half a class trying to get her to hear one sentence. Can't make up her mind on assignments, very unclear on requirements when she does. Makes bad writing suggestions. Grades easy if you're a decent writer but the class is absolutely painful. This class ruined a subject I once really liked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	0	Literature	502	5	1	1	1	85074	12/1/09	Dr. Reinfeld could be a good teacher, but she doesn't respect other's opinions, and she never speaks in a a clear, understandable way. She is easy, but dull.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature		5	5	5	3	85074	11/17/08	An excellent instructor for writing. Gives very helpful feedback for your papers if you put enough effort into them. The rest of the class is easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature	319	4	4	4	3	85074	10/16/08	Prof Reinfeld is extremely fun and an easygoing professor. she is attentive to students' needs. Due to the nature of creative writing, unless you try to fail, you shouldn't worry about terrible grades. She uses the text and MyCourses extensively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Reinfeld	3.4	2	Literature		5	5	5	3	85074	2/12/06	I love her

Rochester Institute of Technology	Susana Reisman	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	808928	8/18/06	Susana was an amazing professor. If she were still teaching at RIT i would recommend her. She got to know each of us and graded us accordingly. If she knew you were capable of amazing things, she believed in you and expected you to produce nothing less. She always offered help, but i feel like we all learned together.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susana Reisman	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	5	808928	2/8/06	I loved her class it was work but was really not that much. She loves creativity in her students but i think gave a good education for photo arts 1 and 2. I do recomend her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	2	127873	5/26/11	Extremely knowledgeable on the subject of design. Very interested in engaging the class in the subjects presented. No tests, just three five-page essays and that's it. He actually is a very nice guy, just very "matter-of-fact" which is easy to get over. I would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	127873	6/20/08	Want everything you do to look like lella and massimo vignelli?? This is the place for you. Anything but european post-modern design crap will not be accepted. We're in America not the german bauhaus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	4	127873	2/2/08	It seems like Roger has mixed reviews. Yes he is soft spoken and can seem boring at times, but he is right to the point and doesnt waste time with busy work. listen to his critique and learn from it. easy going, easy A. highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	5	3	127873	5/5/06	Roger is very laid-back.. his classes are not that bad.. they have been really short since I took his class.. he's an easy going guy, but focuses a lot on graphic design. Many would find him boring but if you just show up to class, listen to his criticism, and just put up with maybe a half hour lecture once a week-- it's pretty much an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	4	5	127873	10/18/05	He takes a while to warm up to, but once you realize that he cares a lot about the craft and is actually trying to teach you something, he's much easier to understand. Don't expect to do post-modern work in his class; he'll expect you to go back and re-do it. Remington loves modern design. Chances are if you really love design, You'll love Roger.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		4	2	1	3	127873	9/3/05	He's very unforgiving of non-design oriented students.

Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	4	127873	1/31/10	This is one of the best professors I have had a RIT. He knows so much about design and knows so many big designers, he is really interesting. He may come off as really serious, but I think that is just because he wants he students to leave his class with some quality knowledge. He really cares about your work. He also exposes you to great work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	2	3	127873	4/23/08	He is very dry, dull, and boring. He sits and orders assistant to deliver papers and handouts. Do I feel like he has the spark to teach or make things fun? No. Time to retire? Yes! One thing I HATE is that he makes us to buy his book for the course and we wasted good $50 on the book. We only read average 3 chapter for one quarter. Waste of money!
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	0	Graphic Arts	302	2	2	2	2	127873	10/26/06	Sent me an early academic advising with a D- because I "have a bad attitude in class" only because I don't comment during critiques or get his opinion on everything I do. Egotistical, boring, droning. If you're on his bad side he'll give you a lousy grade even if your work is good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	4	5	4	127873	5/3/06	roger is an awesome teacher and lets you now exactly what he wants from you. if you put some good solid effor in the work, things will be good for you. if u r respectiful to him and if you are on his good side, the class will be lovely to go to. he a very intelligent and a very good person to know especially if you are a design major.
Rochester Institute of Technology	R. Roger Remington	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		3	1	2	2	127873	9/26/05	Extremely narrow minded, should teach history instead of design, plays favorites and grades based on bias rather than work presented, boring and a waste of time

The only thing that I really hated was giving an oral report, but everyone hates them anyways. Gives a lot of work and forces you to memorize information for quizzes, but grades very fairly, and gives excellent feedback on assignments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Repp	4.6	2	Writing		4	4	5	3	919737	1/28/10	Gives moderate amount of work.

Very flexible; takes student opinions very seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Repp	4.6	2	Writing		5	5	4	2	919737	5/17/07	One of the best teachers ever. go to class and do the easy assignments and u get an A. i am the worst writer ever and i got prety much an A in every paper. only thing is that you gotta go to every class but he usually ends early and he keeps your attention. he even does some magic tricks.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Repp	4.6	2	Writing	535	3	4	4	3	919737	2/25/10	Really teaches you how to write clearly--with practical tips. Wish I'd taken this course earlier. Grades fairly--even though sometimes you don't like it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Repp	4.6	2	Writing	403	3	5	4	4	919737	5/5/09	Nice guy, really has a passion for technical writing, you can tell he knows what he is talking about. Tries to keep class interesting, and for the most part I learned A LOT. Assignments are very helpful, worth doing. Quizzes are very tough if you do not pay attention and study. Sometimes he is not clear on when things are due, but thats about it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Repp	4.6	2	Writing	403	5	5	5	2	919737	11/16/06	His effecttive technical communication class was easy. All you have to do is follow instructions and you'll get an A. Good teacher who makes his lessons easy to follow.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	4	605965	1/15/08	in short, he is an idiot, he repeats the same basic material and dose not go over the hard stuf. also on the test safer is not always better, if you put more then he wants you loose points, and you code exactly how he wants or again you loose points. he's a really nice guy and will try to help but usually it doesn't cause he dosen't know his stuf
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	605965	4/23/07	Good teacher and very good guy. A little boring and tests are tough if you haven't had prior experience with the material. Seemed to get a little confused on harder homeworks and test problems. Tests are multiple choice and t/f so they get specific. If you take this class make sure you look at Raj's site for information.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	605965	2/3/06	Good guy and very friendly and I see him about once or twice a week eating lunch and he still says high, I did good on the tests but I already knew the stuff so they didnt seem that hard, those monday quizzes were dumb but I dont think it was his idea. Try him out you will like him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	605965	11/9/05	Friendly and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	0	Computer Science		3	2	2	5	605965	11/2/05	Basically his class includes lots of rambling and repeating things previously covered. I don't learn much in my actual lecture and dread attending. When attending CS review sessions, you realize just how much you haven't learned. He's a good guy, just isn't organized enough and doesn't teach like he should sometimes. Likes to hit kids with candy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Reynolds	3.5	0	Computer Science		3	2	1	3	605965	10/13/05	I do not think this man cares if his students are accutally learning anything. He just kinda rambles on in his lectures if anyone is paying attention. He also dosnt care if students even get the material prior to being tested on it. "My job is just to test you".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	5	1351218	3/25/13	The rudest professor I ever had. He doesn't care about your work, just expects you to get it done and get it. Doesn't bother to help you and he make sarcastic comments that are rude. I wouldn't recommend him at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	210	3	5	4	4	1351218	11/14/12	Professor was very helpful with material, even if students didn't understand anything that was going on. Would stay after and have extended office hours if need be. TA was awesome as well. He was hard for some but overall got a great learning experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	210	4	5	5	4	1351218	11/6/12	AWESOME PROFESSOR. Super helpful. Will stay after class, help students and answer questions. Best Professor I have had at RIT so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	4	1351218	2/4/12	Funny but great professor. He's there to help if you need any, on skype, via email, or in person. But don't get his bad side. He goes through the slides, on some he puts more emphasis and gives examples. Great prof overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	3	5	4	2	1351218	4/26/11	Great Professor all around. Anyone who complains about him were the ones doing bad. As long as you paid attention and listened to his advise as well as his teachings then you were able to get an easy A. You have to care otherwise he won't. He has his rules. I advise you follow them if you have him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	1	Information Technology	539	4	2	4	4	1351218	1/29/10	Ok lecturer. Seemed to put a lot of weight onto the graphics aspect of projects. Definitely knows his stuff, but grading is a little weird.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	360	4	4	4	3	1351218	11/15/12	Do NOT have side conversations in his class. If someone is talking that's not him, there's going to be a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	210	4	5	5	1	1351218	11/6/12	Professor Reynolds is a very good teacher and specializes in curriculum, which means he knows how to present the material in the best possible way. He was very understanding and extremely willing to help. He likes to have fun and joke around in class. For someone who dislikes programming, I always looked forward to going to class. I recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	218	4	5	5	4	1351218	2/29/12	Great guy, amazing professor. He WILL teach you how to code properly, and efficiently. Class was always a lot of fun, and he puts in a lot of time and effort to teaching the material in a fun manner, as well as rewriting it all to make sense. If you have him, ask him about the 'Duncans'. Best professor, would take any class he offers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	4	5	4	4	1351218	11/9/11	One of the best professors I've had at RIT. Lectures are pretty much just slides but he keeps it very interesting. In class exercises and projects are clear, but if you need help he is very willing to spend some time with you. Highly recommend his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Reynolds	3.8	0	Information Technology		2	2	2	4	1351218	10/21/10	Reads off of slides. Gave ridiculous amounts of work, left students spending hours on PEs on things they haven't even learned yet. Would just "assume" we knew material. Would be difficult for amateur programmer to make it through the quarter. Terrible teaching methods. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Rhodes	3.8	2	Film		5	5	4	5	1343047	8/16/10	I think he's a pretty interesting guy and was very helpful. I think he's good at helping you develop your ideas without trying to change them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Rhodes	3.8	1	Film		4	3	3	5	1343047	4/25/10	Rhodes is a pretty cool guy overall, he isn't particularly helpful or insightful all the time, and he definitely gives conflicting reviews on your films. He isn't a bad teacher, he just isn't a great teacher. His class is pretty easy overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christian Richter	3.5	2	Engineering	309	4	4	3	3	1628283	10/19/11	Great guy but some homework are a bit confusing and he tends to cycle his lectures. Some days it is the same topic for a long period of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luisa Rios-Owens	5.0	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	1094340	1/17/08	Luisa is a fun and very experienced teacher. She immediately connects with students and will do all in her power to make sure you 'get your money's worth.' I highly recommend her above any other spanish teacher at RIT. She is always available throughout the day and tells you every question on your quizzes/ tests the day before!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		4	3	4	3	1255320	4/11/13	He's conversational, and keeps the class really interesting. He has quizzes, three exams, and a paper. If you do your reading and listen to power point. It's a easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	1	Criminal Justice	528	4	3	2	2	1255320	8/15/12	Took him for Minorities in CJ and Theories of Crime class. Nice guy, and the class is relatively easy but he forces people to participate and does call out on students. He is very opinionated, and goes off on tangents about halfway through class. Does give you study guides for midterm and final. Also assigns an 8-page paper, but it's not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		4	3	5	4	1255320	1/31/12	Professor Robertson is really into Sociology and it shows in his class. Took this class on the recommendation of a friend and did not regret it. He is very funny and not afraid to say things that most people would keep to themselves. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice	501	4	5	5	4	1255320	10/28/10	Very professional, highly recommended. This teacher is very respectful of students and their opinions. He is definitely one of my top 5 list. And he is just a genuinely cool guy overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		4	4	3	4	1255320	2/16/10	Nice guy. Looks like he is going to cry when you mention black people or wellfare. Easy tests, weird debates, ok class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	1	Criminal Justice		2	3	3	1	1255320	10/22/09	Well Nick is a very not so funny guy always trying to make jokes that are not funny.. Work was not bad.recommend to take if you like to read and write. if not stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	2	1255320	3/4/09	Awesome professor. He doesn't overload you with work, but still makes sure you learn something so that the class isn't a waste of money (like some other liberal arts / social science classes I've had). He's really funny and laid back, and tells good stories. Easy A and you'll learn a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	4	3	1255320	2/17/09	The topic of Theories in Criminal Justice is a bit bland, but the teacher's great. The powerpoints are way too long, but you don't have to take notes and he generally makes class very entertaining. Class consists of little reading and take home tests. Definitely take him if you want open and entertaining discussions, great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice	101	5	4	5	3	1255320	2/8/13	Very laid back and very funny. He's a stickler for attendance and timing. If you participate in class you're good to go. Sometimes he calls on people randomly, which is bad for introverts like me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	0	Criminal Justice	445	1	1	2	2	1255320	4/26/12	Took this professor for 'Minority Groups in the CJ System.' He knows what he is talking about, but is still a very brash and offensive person. It's a hard class to take depending on your personal viewpoints. Be wary of this professor...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice	210	5	4	4	5	1255320	10/21/11	He is very laid back and knows his stuff. I always laugh in his class and I took his course at 8am so to make me laugh when I'm half asleep is awesome. His midterm and final are just multiple choice so they were not bad at all. There is only one homework assignment which takes a long time but it is due at the end of the quarter so it is do-able.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	0	Criminal Justice		2	2	2	4	1255320	8/6/10	Introduction to Criminal Justice was an interesting course and I liked the debates, but it was the students that made it enjoyable, not the professor. He isn't very approachable. He thinks he's awesome and is **** against white people even though he's married to one. Refuses to put the powerpoints online and tests are all multiple choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	0	Criminal Justice	506	3	2	2	3	1255320	10/26/09	Tries to be funny; but isn't. Ask a question and he gets off the topic. Not straight forward with what he wants. He assigns chapters and then doesn't cover them. Assigns research paper and then doesn't grade or give feed back on them. Not a good teacher - sorry :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	3	1255320	10/19/09	Taking this professor for the second time, he's fantastic. Do the readings and you'll coast through the class. This just means that you can easily answer his questions and contribute to class discussions and ace the tests. Easy class, mostly debating and talking. Definitely recommended, you'll learn rather than memorize.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Oral Robertson	3.6	2	Criminal Justice	101	5	4	4	3	1255320	2/21/09	I took him for Foundations of Sociology. Awesome teacher, pretty laid back. Out of class work is minimal and his lectures are usually entertaining with stories. I'd never taken any Soc. classes before, but he was really passionate about it and the class was easy and enjoyable. You mostly just have to read and do take home exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	1	Physics	312	2	3	2	2	803100	2/3/09	He's not a bad person, but he kinda sucks at teaching. He's genius when it comes to astronomy/astrophysics, but won't make you understand the basic kinematics and such. Gives a tone of in class stuff. Uses WebAssign, which is waaay harder than his test. Which, btw, have a little to do with whatever we do in class. He's really willing to help thou.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	2	Physics		2	5	4	3	803100	3/1/07	He's a good guy, always willing to help you. great 1 on 1. kinda boring in class. grades tons of in class stuff, that gets kinda annoying. curves the tests, not terribly hard to do well in.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	0	Physics	101	1	1	1	4	803100	10/8/06	Worthless professor. Uses difficult third party homework system, bases tests on very little actual classwork, very hard and vague labs, spends more time drawing cute pictures on his free body diagrams than actually teaching. The TA's will be the only help you'll get. He's a genius on his own, but this man CANNOT TEACH AT ALL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	803100	1/23/06	Bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	2	Physics	311	5	5	5	5	803100	11/8/07	hes a good guy. i didnt have any trouble in the class. he is always helpful if you ask question. not the most interesting lectures but the rest is good. tests were easy if you know your stuff. not an intimidating guy, very laid back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	1	Physics		3	3	3	4	803100	1/31/07	Seems nice, teaches off of powerpoints wish he had a little more info, tests are kind of hard, class based on inclass examples like a lab and it can be hard if you dont know what you are doing because you do it in a group and either you know it or not
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Robinson	2.6	0	Physics		3	1	1	5	803100	1/30/06	The man has a pine tree in his ass. Not helpful at all, though weights tests alot which helps.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Roby	2.3	2	Sociology		3	4	4	4	1487785	1/12/13	I thought she was a very good teacher with interesting lectures and opinions. Tests and essays were pretty straightforward. You may not like her if your not interested in the class and just Facebook though and she will definitely not like you either if this is the case.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Roby	2.3	0	Sociology	101	5	1	1	1	1487785	2/7/11	most boring, uneducated professor i have ever had, does not even know what shes talking about half the time, doesnt even teach sociology half the time, has long pauses to think about what to say next and her opinions are usually backed with false information, you can teach yourself this class and do better then listening to her talk for 2 hours
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Roby	2.3	1	Sociology		4	2	3	1	1487785	2/1/11	Talks a lot, doesn't really teach, just gives her opinion for roughly 2 hours. Isn't very receptive to opposing views. however, pretty easy with 3 tests and an essay. just pay attention to what she thinks and the chapter reviews in the book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Roby	2.3	0	Sociology	210	4	2	2	4	1487785	4/25/11	Very one-sided and ****. Her tests are less dependent on classes and more on facts from the textbook, so it's okay if you don't pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Roby	2.3	0	Sociology		3	2	2	1	1487785	2/2/11	Without doubt the most boring teacher I have ever had. Basically just lectures her opinions for the whole class. pretty much the only way to succeed in her class is to read the chapters in the book and remember what her opinions are for the tests. At least 25% of the class falling asleep on any given day. NOT GOOD
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Rodriguez	3.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	5	1627778	4/3/12	He is a good teacher and very humble. He assigns about one homework assignment per week, and completion means full credit. There is not enough material covered for a philosophy class; In my opinion, he could have fit in double the material with fewer discussions, but the class is a discussion class. Different opinions are welcomed in discussions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Rodriguez	3.8	2	Philosophy		4	3	4	2	1627778	11/3/11	Overall a good class. Will sometimes try to force you into the discussions, but there are lots of people who have never spoken in that class. No indication of what your grades are on homework, but the average grade was an A , so its not too hard. No book, either. We just got readings emailed to us.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Rodriguez	3.8	1	Philosophy		4	3	2	3	1627778	11/10/11	Nice guy, hard to follow his logic when he reads powerpoints.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Rodriguez	3.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	2	1627778	10/18/11	Kept class interesting and let us talk about what interested/concerned us. Very relaxed. Invested in students' education. Has accent, but is not strong and was not a problem for me in the least.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	2	Engineering	360	4	5	5	4	514190	2/15/13	I had Dr. Rommel for Intro to Semi Dev and he was an excellent professor. He knows a lot about the Semiconductor industry and really got me interested in that side of EE. He clearly explains what's going to be on the tests beforehand and a lot of the questions are based on the homework he gives. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	2	Engineering	560	3	5	5	5	514190	4/13/09	Gives good homeworks and fair tests. Insanely knowledgeable about semiconductor physics yet has creative and funny ways of explaining things to make them sound easy. He will also happily answer any questions regarding semiconductor physics even if its not related to the class. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	0	Engineering	520	3	1	1	5	514190	1/29/06	The guy doesn't seem qualified.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	2	Engineering	360	5	5	4	2	514190	3/14/11	Had Dr. Rommel for Intro to Semiconductors. He was fun and helpful, although didn't give any homework or examples. Exams were take-home so you basically learned by completing them. Overall he was knowledgeable and provided great resources online, just didn't give opportunities to practice calculations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	2	Engineering		3	5	5	4	514190	5/15/06	Excellent teacher! He might seem to only know basics, as all he teaches you is what you need to know, but ask him a deeper question and the knowledge is there. Very helpful with homework, but challanging, keeps you working. One of the best professors I've ever had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Rommel	4.2	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	514190	11/29/04	Awesome lab teacher, really helps out if you don't understand something. He also is very excited about microelectronics and is cool to be taught by someone like that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	1	Science		3	3	3	3	67475	1/28/09	I am not a chem major, but I was a science student.I'm extremely shy, but I approached him to discuss a possible recommendation for an internship. I didn't know him very well (I didn't know any of my professors very well...) and he accused me of trying to swindle a recommendation from him. I've been bitter and damaged ever since.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science	230	5	5	5	3	67475	10/13/08	Very good professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		5	5	5	5	67475	2/8/07	Greatest professor ever! Lectures are soo fun because he just tells stories all period. Tests are so easy, even though the grades don't really matter. He actually cares if you learn the material rather than making impossible tests and grading harshly. If you have the chance to take a class of his, DO IT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	0	Science		2	2	2	3	67475	9/3/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	67475	5/27/04	Pretty good... exams could be clearer
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science	312	5	4	5	2	67475	10/24/08	Really great guy and teacher. Wants students to learn, but knows it's chem for non majors so he is very lenient. All tests can be made up/substituted with the final (which has the same questions) Labs are a bit hard but the lab teachers should help a bit if asked. Overall good class and the funniest teacher I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		5	5	5	5	67475	5/21/07	Great guy. Funny and makes class interesting. Lightens the mood with a story or two. Laid back. Easy going. Expects you to work hard though. Study and practice and you will do fine here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		4	4	3	4	67475	5/16/06	He wants you to learn, and since the class is a 200-level, he is very lenient to redos. Especially for labs, he allowed us to resubmit each lab report for a higher grade. Thus, it is easy to get an A as long as you work just a bit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		4	5	5	5	67475	8/31/05	Gotta love the Reverse Polish Notation!!! One of my favorite professors so far!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Rosenberg	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	67475	3/11/03	Great SlideShow
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	4	67415	2/16/13	Tests were extremely difficult, but he made it so that the final either doesn't count towards your grade or replaces all other lower grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics	383	3	5	5	3	67415	3/18/08	Awesome teacher. Was able to make the material interesting, and did so whenever possible. Lectures were extremely clear and very helpful. Quizzes were fair, and consisted of homework questions. Tests were a challenge, but no harder than all the other sections of Calc 3. This guy was into what he was teaching 100%. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics	283	2	5	5	4	67415	2/3/08	Dr. Ross is amazing, simply put. He's very clear and well-organized during lectures, and gives very challenging, but stimulating, worksheets. His policy on homework is generous and allows plenty of freedom from test to test. His exams, however, are very intensive and require a lot of thought. All in all, He's the best math teacher I've had yet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	67415	9/13/04	The coolest professor ever. He's goofy but intelligent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67415	12/20/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics	328	3	5	5	4	67415	5/15/10	The best professor I ever had in RIT thus far. Fun and interesting lectures. However, he's NOT an easy professor and his tests are challenging, although they are totally not impossible. I took the class as an elective and I'm glad that he was my teacher. Nice Bronx accent too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics	383	2	4	3	3	67415	2/4/08	Ross is a nice guy, but he lectures fast and you really need to pay attention to everything he does. The tests are extremely hard, but the homeworks aren't graded and the quizzes are moderately easy. He is approachable, but it is necessary to work really hard to understand all the material. He is overall an okay teacher...
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	2	67415	11/27/04	Incredible wealth of knowledge. Has real-world experience, and it shows. Extremely effective teaching style; best math teacher I've ever had. Take him if you can. He's not a free ride, but he's a genuinely good teacher. I learned a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Ross	4.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	67415	5/2/04	Awesome teacher. Very clear on explanations. Would recommend to anyone. I loved his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	1	Biology		1	2	3	3	851587	1/29/13	Dr. Rothman, AKA the Roth Daddy, AKA R-Ditty, seriously the hardest professor in the entire college. Good Luck. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	1	5	851587	7/18/11	unprofessional, continues only because of tenure. Does not pursue disciplinary action against students who cheat in his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	2	4	851587	6/13/11	Dated information, and poor pedagogy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	2	4	851587	5/15/11	Does not give reading assignments. Nice that he stays after scheduled hours in lab, but does not assign enough homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	2	Biology	421	3	5	5	5	851587	10/10/10	I loved this class- to succeed, you need to write down everything he says and memorize it. If he says it, it will be on the exam. I liked this because you never spend useless time studying stuff you don't need to know. If you need help, go to him!! He is very helpful. People who do bad in his class skip lectures and don't care enough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	2	Biology		2	2	5	4	851587	5/1/09	I hate this professor, he was so bad and the class is at 8am, who gets up that early. The exams are hard because he wants you to know everything, so memorize everything...to bad it's a required class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	2	Biology	421	2	4	3	3	851587	11/20/07	To get an A in Dr Rothmans class: 1. go to class and take prolific notes or have a really good memory 2. go talk to him as much as u can. He does expect u to kno everything he talks about but most things he repeats. also I think he wants to kno that u care about ur grade and want to learn otherwise he doesnt care about it. argue for pts on tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	851587	6/19/07	He sounds friendly and nice, but beware! do not get fooled by his jokes and smile! He is one of the worst professor at RIT. The worst at teaching, the worst at grading, but yeah, good at flirting!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		5	1	1	3	851587	4/1/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	1	Biology		2	2	3	1	851587	12/5/06	Extremely hard exams, definitely does not cut any slack. Grades come from the 3 horrible exams and a few easy quizzes. Not the most helpful of professors either and difficult to approach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology	450	1	2	2	1	851587	5/2/12	exams are far too long, looks for exact wordings and rarely gives partial credit, seems to enjoy the fact that some students do poorly. he says his philosophy on exams is that you should just cram everything you hear in your head then spit it out on paper. I have a 3.5, yet I will likely get a D in his class, but he's the only one who teaches GE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	1	4	851587	7/10/11	Not interested in student success. As others have remarked, should provide reading schedule
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	1	1	4	851587	5/19/11	Would be better if he gave lecture notes and a reading list.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	1	Biology		1	2	3	4	851587	5/11/11	Openly admits to grading subjectively. Does not provide a reading schedule, and does not direct students to original literature. Discourages students from citing prior art. Vague exams, too long for time allotted. Strictest grader I've had. Plays favorites with students. Quashes curiosity, rather than inspire it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	2	3	851587	5/29/10	He was really tough- no text, just notes, but too much too fast,10-12 pages of notes per one hour lecture, and you need to memorize every word and every drawing. Labs are good, you learn a ton and get really good at this stuff, but WARNING - if a lab doesn't work perfectly you have to do it over until it does,6 or 7 times. Easy to get behind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	2	Biology	421	2	3	4	5	851587	10/24/08	In my opinion, a really good teacher. I can see how he would be hard for some to comprehend and I admit it's tough going to an 8am full 2 hour intense class but if you go pay attention, take notes, and study hard you'll really learn a lot from him. Really knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	2	Biology		2	5	3	5	851587	7/26/07	Rothman is by far not the easiest professor I've ever had, in fact he's one of the most difficult. However, if you're willing to work, he will teach you a lot of stuff that is so useful in co-ops it is not even funny...speaking of which, back to lab!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		1	2	1	2	851587	5/18/07	worst grader in my whole student life. Makes you buy expensive books but never use them. Lectures r extremely disorganised. No clarity. No idea about source of his lectures, so if you miss a class, you fail the exam! even if you come to class, you waste ur time, hard to follow his lecture. sadly, he is the only one who teaches Gen engineering
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		3	2	2	5	851587	3/6/07	Tests have very difficult fill-in questions and easier short answers. inconsistent grading, but gives some pts back if u go and talk to him. gives more extra credit pts on the second and third tests. extremely boring - fall asleep every morning. don't buy text book, just borrow for the one time that ull ever need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		2	2	2	1	851587	11/17/06	He is a very boring teacher, a harsh grader and is inconsistant on his grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Rothman	2.2	0	Biology		3	2	2	5	851587	10/17/06	Puts me to sleep teaching my favorite subject. Likes his averages to be around 70. Short answer exams only. Harsh grader

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	202	1	1	1	1	739530	1/8/08	he sucks! dont do it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	101	1	1	1	1	739530	2/7/07	Rotundi thinks hes the greatest and vastly more intelligent than his students, and he doesnt hesitate to try and prove it. Don't ask questions, he'll just rip apart your morale and leave you with more questions than when you began. DONT TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS JOKER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	211	1	1	1	4	739530	11/29/06	Horrible teacher. Don't take if you can get out of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	211	1	1	2	4	739530	11/16/06	By far the worst teacher I have ever had. Engineering graphics would be fun if it wasn't for him. Although he does spend the lecture time going basic controls, he will not help you if you need further help. Very sarcastic and grades harshly on little mistakes. Good luck with this course, you'll need it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	739530	10/27/05	this guy is the worst teacher. do not take him. there is not a scale low enough to rate him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering		1	2	1	4	739530	3/2/07	Sarcastic and at times borderline cruel get used to full grades being taken off for things that are hardly even mistakes that he hasnt taught you to fix yet. Ya full grades as in 10 points, thinks he's awesome but is frequently wrong.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	101	3	1	3	4	739530	1/30/07	Started the year horribly!!! As time passed though he loosened up!!! Grades in an odd way and really does dislike to see students do well!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering	211	2	1	1	4	739530	11/20/06	Should not be a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Rotundi	1.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	4	739530	11/24/05	horrible! dont take a class with this joke. doesn't answer questions, not helpful, hates when his students do well.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Evie Rozanski	5.0	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	5	813012	2/21/06	Evie knows what she is talking about. She has a passion about human computer interaction and interface usability. Like most at RIT she is on the difficult side grading but you will get a lot out of her classes. I have had her for six classes in undergrad and graduate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts	500	3	1	2	5	798577	4/24/07	This professor used very few verifiable references and was largely ignorant of new and emerging technologies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	5	798577	1/31/07	i thought this was supposed to be a course about history of PHOTOGRAPHY... have to write essays on topics that have nothing to do with the history of photography... too many tangents, lectures are pretty boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	5	798577	3/25/06	we had him for undergrad and grad classes-his crits were some of the best at rit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	5	798577	1/21/06	Class discussions are not related to course topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts		5	1	1	3	798577	4/16/07	Opened every class (usually late) with "I want to get into the lesson, we have a lot to talk about" .. then proceeds to go off about how when he was of college age, he went to Nicaragua (or wherever it was) instead, or about the illegitimacy of the Bush administration, his problems with young people.. take your pick. None of it was related to photo
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	1	Fine Arts		2	3	3	4	798577	1/2/07	Tough to please, but a good professor nonetheless!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	3	798577	2/3/06	Oh god...i hate this class so much. I loved it first quarter, but this quarter I hate it because of him. He makes me sooooooo confused because nothing is related to Photo. Can spend up to 30 minutes on a tangent. Class always starts 20 minutes late due to tech problems. Uses a mike when there's no need for it since he's already loud enough. Confusi
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elliot Rubenstein	1.8	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	4	798577	1/14/06	Worst prof I have ever had period! Constantly uses the excuse that he is too busy to actually teach or help, in the end he isn't busy doing ANYTHING!! Has his ta's pretty much do his job! Goes off on the worst tangents when he is lecturing on something he thinks is imporant and w ill test you on! Teaches both sections 2nd quarter so you get stuck
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ashok Robin	5.0	2	Finance		2	5	5	5	1647934	7/3/12	I enjoyed the class a lot. Professor Robin made it very easy and simple to understand and calculate derivatives
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ashok Robin	5.0	2	Finance	740	2	5	5	5	1647934	11/17/11	Excellent presentation and clarity of an extremely complex subject (derivatives). Tries to integrate conceptual framework for real-world application of hedging and quantitative analysis with straight-forward problem solving. Exceptional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	0	Philosophy	101	3	2	2	4	1041630	10/24/12	This entire class is about three philosophers and their beliefs. If you want to learn about Ethics do not take this professor, he includes little to no ethical content in his lectures. However, his tests are fairly straight forward. If you are able to follow his disorganized shoot from the hip thought processes then you have a chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	2	1041630	1/26/10	Pretty good teacher. Taught well, put notes up online, and gave fair tests. Also made the class interesting by relating concepts to stories. Easy to talk to, and very friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	2	Philosophy		4	4	3	2	1041630	11/12/08	Great stories, the presenters he picked this last quarter were pretty bad at times, (terrible public speakers). Some were good though. Only problem with Mr. Robison is that he sometimes talks very softly, so sit towards the front and you'll know everything you need to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	2	Philosophy	211	4	5	5	4	1041630	2/1/10	Robison is the man, easily the most thought provoking and intelligent professor I've met so far at RIT. He is an epic debater, and really works to get the basic concepts of philosophy and thought into even the more fickle minds. Take Robison in anything and everything you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	5	1041630	11/13/08	Very enjoyable class, used a lot of examples to display his meaning and it worked very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wade Robison	4.2	2	Philosophy	211	3	4	5	1	1041630	10/22/07	Nice guy, extremely funny stories.. He depends on his own website as opposed to using MyCourses, which is kind of annoying. Tests are mildly challenging, but he gives the answers to you after you take it so you are prepared for the next test. He realizes when students are struggling and likes to help out when he can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Roche	3.2	2	English		4	3	4	3	1258246	1/31/10	He is a cool guy. He is like an old beatnik. His class can be dull at times, but come and listen to his lectures because he is big on attendance. Overall, his class is easy. It seems like he is really involved with the poetry and writing community. The only intimidating thing was reading your poetry in front of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Roche	3.2	0	English		2	2	2	1	1258246	3/2/09	do not buy the book, its never used. bring your computer for something to work on because the lectures can get boring. There's not clear instruction for what he wants out of essays.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Roche	3.2	2	English	504	3	4	4	3	1258246	3/21/09	Don't listen to the poster below. Textbooks are used very often. You'll see in the classroom that they're used very often. The only qualm I have with this class is that the professor doesn't provide subtitles for all of his videos.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts	277	4	5	5	3	624086	5/24/10	Had an awesome time in her class. She is an amazing teacher. Kept the class entertaining and the topics she taught were interesting. Loved the exams, open note and image identifications. Plus side was the candies. :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	624086	11/12/09	She gives powerpoint lectures quite often but spices the class up with well-chosen videos. Indeed, she's very kind and understanding. This class does not require a textbok and is an easy A, but it is still possible to learn quite a bit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	4	624086	2/2/06	Very excellent teacher to take. She is clear on her lectures and willing to answer any question you ask even a stupid question. You just need to read the notes and listen to lectures, you will pass this class easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	3	4	3	624086	3/16/10	took her class. 4 exams. not bad. first part's open book while the second part's closed book. for the second part, you gotta know certain images shown in class- mainly the title, who's the painter/creator/author, dates, names, location, style. not too bad over all. always brings candy to class! wish it wasnt 3x a week!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	5	4	2	624086	2/3/06	i love sid. she brought candy to every class. she's easy if you're hard of hearing and can hear. she's clear, makes the material interesting. to be honest, i didn't have to work that hard for her class, and I still got an A. She's always willing to help out and listen with her students, and tells great stories.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sidonie Roepke	4.7	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	3	624086	5/22/05	Sid is probably one of the best teachers ive ever had. her classes are usually short (less than a hour) but you learn a lot from it. she's kind and understanding - will help you with anything!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		5	5	4	5	1615876	5/17/12	Probably my favorite ASL teacher. I've had him for ASL 1, 2, and now 5. Really easy to understand, makes class entertaining, class generally goes by quickly. Tests can sometimes be difficult, but in general everything is pretty easy. I'd definitely recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		5	5	5	4	1615876	3/29/12	Amazing teacher! All the ASL teachers are pretty solid, but Rood is very understanding and patient. And I like his teaching methods a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language	390	5	4	5	4	1615876	11/20/11	Rood is an excellent instructor for Sign Language. He teaches very well, and keeps the class entertaining. As long as you show up to class, and do the homework, you shouldn't have any trouble.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		2	5	4	4	1615876	11/1/11	Rood is fantastic. He's strict but fair, and a great teacher. He also manages to keep the class light-hearted and interesting. A definite must-take for any beginning ASL class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		5	4	4	4	1615876	9/5/11	I have taken 2 (and currently in a 3rd) classes with him. He is Deaf and very involved in Deaf Community events (including out of state ones). This led to him canceling about 4 or 5 classes (typically with advanced notice). Easy grader and lenient with due dates. Easy to understand. Made learning ASL easy and fun. Definitely recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	0	Sign Language		1	2	2	5	1615876	5/17/12	In class, yes, Ron is very understanding and patient with us. However, on the tests, his fingerspelling is extremely fast and difficult to understand - especially if you came from a much slower professor. It was frustrating going from someone who spelled very slow to Ron and it hurt my grade a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		3	4	5	5	1615876	2/16/12	Awesome professor! Fair, helpful, and understanding (just make sure to communicate with him). Fun classroom experience!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		4	5	5	5	1615876	11/10/11	Excellent teacher! Very clear with his expectations, if you do your work, you will pass this course. If you do not, you will not. He puts forth EFFORT if you put EFFORT too. AWESOME teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Rood	4.3	2	Sign Language		5	5	5	4	1615876	10/18/11	Best ASL teacher I have had! He is so interested in his teaching and wants to learn more and more about his students. I have taken two and will be taking 2 more classes with him. Easy going, fun and easy to understand. Take a class with him for sure!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business	483	5	5	5	4	1045688	11/26/09	Great professor who really wants students to learn! He seems to really enjoy teaching and will take the extra time to answer your questions. Take his class if you have the chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business	501	4	5	4	4	1045688	2/28/09	Excellent professor. He provides excellent feedback on your speeches, so you will improve majorly in your speaking style in his class. Lectures also vary per each class, which provides something new each day you come to class. I highly recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business	363	4	5	4	4	1045688	3/1/08	Great professor! Cares about the students and whether or not they "get it". Real world examples, videos, guest speakers. Highly recommended. Work load is between little to moderate. Keep on task, you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business	483	5	4	4	3	1045688	11/18/09	Excellent professor. Very clear and to the point with explaining concepts in the class. Tests are reasonable. Workload for this class was very light.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business	301	4	5	4	2	1045688	4/29/08	The Man is a legend in our times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Rosenthal	4.6	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1045688	10/30/07	He communicates very well with his students. This is the first time I've ever taken a marketing class and because of his teaching skills, it's now my minor in college. He's a great professor and is there for his students. I would recomend him to everyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Rothenberg	1.5	0	Business		2	1	2	3	1644726	2/6/13	This was online class. disorganized, does not grade within a timely manner, does not return emails for class questions, group projects are a joke, and a bit too much work for a ten week period...Don't take OB with this instructor, it won't be good for your GPA or stress level, if you have to make sure to use proper and a lot of citations..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Rothenberg	1.5	0	Business	102	2	2	1	2	1644726	11/15/11	ineffective
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Rothenberg	1.5	0	Business	320	2	1	1	3	1644726	1/22/13	Just awful. Grades without justification, denigrates students in the classroom, openly discussed her preference for research over teaching, made excuses for returning papers late, etc, etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Rothenberg	1.5	0	Business	740	2	3	1	1	1644726	11/14/11	-
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology	514	5	5	5	3	681424	9/28/10	She's the best. She a good teacher and everything that she teaches is clear in my eye. I would really recommend her intro to psych.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		4	4	4	4	681424	5/1/07	Her lecture are VERY boring but the class is overall pretty easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	5	5	681424	2/20/06	I did not really pay attention to her classes but I did pretty good on the papers she assigned. She is awesome and very understanding. I highly reccomend her. I'd take her again if the chance arose.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		3	5	4	5	681424	9/15/05	She's really insightful and knows her stuff, with a bit of crazyness to the classes, as stereotypical as that sound being a psych class and all :-D If you have her, no worries, shes really cool man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		5	5	2	2	681424	10/8/08	she knows what she is talking about. not exactly cut out to be a teacher but she is cut out to give advice or with helpfulness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	681424	6/16/06	The only downfall to her is her lectures are BORING. The quizzes are done in groups and there's an online discussion board. Attend all classes and you will pass easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gail Rothman-Marshall	4.4	2	Psychology		5	3	5	3	681424	10/19/05	She's a good teacher and knows her stuff. At the beginning to the mid-quarter, she is really cool and fun and you'd want to go to her classes. But after mid quarter, it gets boring and dull and nobody hardly pay attention to her. She's a pretty easy grader though- she lets you use notes and do quizzes in groups.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design	100	2	5	5	4	1646785	4/23/12	Awesome professor. He has been in the real design world so he knows what people want.

He's genuine and is passionate about design, which is clear in the classroom. His teaching method is different in that he gives his students a real life perspective of design and how it will be applied. I will continue to take his courses and strongly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	4	1646785	1/3/12	Royka is by the far the best professor I've ever had! He is very understanding and truly cares for his students success. He has met with me outside of his office hours to help me when I really needed it.

He is serious about attendance, if you miss one class you will get an early warning. He takes the time to meet with students outside of class, to make sure you're on track and providing help. He is willing to help any student prepare a portfolio and work on getting an internship.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design		3	5	5	5	1646785	4/15/12	Royka is definitely the best professor at RIT in regards to his passion for design and love of teaching.

He will truly help you succeed as a designer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design	400	2	5	5	5	1646785	1/23/12	Royka is one of the most amazing professors I have had.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design		3	5	5	5	1646785	1/2/12	Graphic design students at RIT: I highly suggest taking at least one class with Royka. He was my instructor for Symbol & Icon. He's very clear about what was expected in his class. He goes above and beyond to make himself available to students.

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Royka	5.0	2	Design		2	5	5	4	1646785	11/16/11	Overall a Great professor! He legitimately cares about his students & wants everybody to succeed. He even goes out of his way to meet with students to make sure they are on track. If you have the chance to take him, I definitely would! :) (He does expect you to go to EVERY class though, so if you like to skip a lot i'd go with another professor)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Rubel	4.2	2	Writing	227	3	4	5	4	347655	11/11/08	She's the best teacher of all of the writing seminar teachers. She always make the topic interesting and fun for the class to discuss. She can be tough but she's sure fair.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Rubel	4.2	2	Writing		2	5	4	1	347655	6/5/05	this is a professor who cares about her students. make sure you do all your work and improvise after each correction of papers, she likes to see effort each time after a paper is corrected and revised. great professor, not easy, but not nerve wracking hard

Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Rubel	4.2	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	347655	3/12/06	A wonderful and sentimental professor who cares and expects students to thrive in the success of writing. The classes can occasionally be a bit boring, especially with the lectures. Homeworks are quite easy, but the written essays (usually three essays) can be very time-consuming unless you have an outline.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Rubel	4.2	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	347655	1/6/05	this teacher rocks- a bit boring sometimes but the teacher is very fair to students and is willing to work with students after class hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Rubel	4.2	2	Writing		2	5	5	5	347655	12/10/04	Professor Rubel was by far my favorite teacher- she went out of her way to help me in class and even encouraged and stimulated intellectual discussions (which is rare among the vast majority of my professors)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maria Rubino	1.7	0	Engineering		2	1	1	3	340588	2/3/06	The world can rejoice! She is no longer here. She mumbles, has this weird accent, and is impossible to understand. In addition to that, she also talks extremely fast, so you're lost. Is more interested in her own research than actually teaching her class or helping her students. Tests were insane and hard.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Maria Rubino	1.7	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	340588	6/16/05	God awful. Wretched, evil, bitter woman. Never helpful, terrible Carpal tunnel inducing lectures. Thank god she left.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Ruhling	3.2	2	Music	481	1	5	5	4	955174	3/1/12	Ruhling really is a great professor, but you have to understand going in that his courses aren't the GPA-padding liberal arts you may be used to - they're hard, and you have to put in real work. That said, if you put the work in, you should come out immensely knowledgeable about whatever subject you're taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Ruhling	3.2	2	Music		2	4	4	4	955174	10/27/09	Good orchestra instructor. Expects a lot from students and gets stressed easily when things aren't right- but it's for the orchestra's own good. Kinda funny and a nice person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Ruhling	3.2	0	Music	101	1	1	2	4	955174	2/1/07	Absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life -- not exaggerating in the least. He has a very poor teaching style, very rude, and makes tests unreasonably difficult. AVOID AT ALL COST!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Ruhling	3.2	2	Music		4	4	4	5	955174	10/3/11	I had Ruhling for orchestra and even though he may get angry easily, it just shows that he is really passionate about music and really cares about it. He just doesn't want people to slack off and not try at all, he can tell when someone is trying and just doesnt understand. He is an amazing teacher who cares a lot about what he does.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Ruhling	3.2	0	Music	101	1	2	1	3	955174	2/28/08	Horrible horrible horrible........ bad teaching style, ridiculously hard tests for no particular reason. Makes music history boring.... the only interesting part was towards the end when he talks about film music.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eli Saber	2.9	2	Engineering	703	2	4	4	3	583746	11/9/11	Not the easiest profs but he expects you to be on top of your work. Gives quizzes at least every week. Exams are similar question to the quizzes and lecture material. Basically study the notes and quizzes and you will do fine in the class. Fair grader and very entertaining during class. Don't get put off by other comments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eli Saber	2.9	0	Engineering		1	2	2	2	583746	8/22/09	One of if not the hardest EE professors. We had 20 quizzes (he dropped 10), the midterm took 3-3.5 hours, and the final took 5 hours. He also teaches off of PDF notes, meaning he doesn't write on the board which allows him to fly through material without really explaining it fully.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Eli Saber	2.9	1	Engineering	703	1	2	3	4	583746	10/27/10	Brutal grading scheme. Decent lecture, but wastes half of class time on quizzes. Hardest prof. I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eli Saber	2.9	2	Engineering	453	2	3	5	4	583746	4/24/07	If you are looking for the easy A he is not the one for you. His lectures are very clear and he tells you what he wants you to know... everything. I still like him and i think that he is the best teacher for Linear 1 and 2 (other professors just use his material and homework assignments and solutions so you might as well get it from the source)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Soham Sadhu	3.0	1	Economics		3	3	2	2	768859	11/13/06	He doesnt return stuff, so you dont know where you stand. But he does drop 2 of the lowest quizes, boring his accent isnt that bad once you get use to it, but that takes like 3 weeks. Conjuma = consumer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Soham Sadhu	3.0	2	Economics		3	5	2	4	768859	3/8/06	Really boring class. Gives pop quizzes so make sure you show up to class. Drops the 2 lowest quiz grades. I am sure you could do good in this class if you paid attention really well, but it is really hard bc the class is really dull.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	0	Engineering		2	1	1	5	72691	5/15/12	Not helpful. Not clear. Makes many mistakes. Makes up deadlines on the fly, then blames students for not reading the syllabus (which makes no mention of due dates).You might as well pick up a good book then take this class--it'll be less stressful and you'll learn more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	2	Engineering	685	2	5	4	4	72691	11/4/09	Excellent prof. Works hard to make the in class learning fun. He dresses well too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	2	Engineering		2	4	3	3	72691	11/8/07	Wants to help you learn, but sometimes he's not very clear. Doesn't give enough practical examples to help you in class. His tests and projects aren't hard just badly worded, be prepared to learn on your own. Overall though he's nice and fair, I'd take him again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	0	Engineering		5	1	1	5	72691	7/14/05	Someone ought to give him a pink slip...he knows nothing abt the subject(s)!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	2	Engineering		3	4	3	NULL	72691	5/26/03	He knows a lot but doesn't impart his knowledge so well. Doesn't make tests that hard though. Is helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	2	Engineering	685	3	5	5	5	72691	11/19/09	He knows his stuff.. Always well prepared and answer questions very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ferat Sahin	3.0	0	Engineering	554	2	2	2	4	72691	5/19/09	Sahin is NOT QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE! At least four times per class, students had to correct his mistakes. Was visibly uncomfortable when students asked questions and appeared to be making up answers. Gave very long, mistake-ridden tests. Tried to copy first exam at the last minute, but copier was broken so we had 45 minutes to take it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jessica Salamone	5.0	2	Medicine		4	5	5	5	1692302	4/27/12	Wonderful teacher, wonderful class! She makes learning interesting and fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		2	2	2	2	737353	1/30/12	Nanette knows the material ridiculously well (she wrote the textbook after all) and assumes that you should too. Study hard, don't mess around. Take this class seriously. Labs are long, lectures have tons of notes, and tests are tough. Put the effort in and you'll pass the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		4	2	2	2	737353	10/21/11	Nanette's class isn't that bad, just read along and show up and pay attention and you should be fine. However, she talks down to everyone. She assumes all of the students are stupid and will do things wrong before even explaining assignments. She has no right to talk to students the way she does. She is irritable and condescending. Don't suck up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science	102	1	1	2	3	737353	2/1/11	ridiculous standards for a class that is not all that useful. she acts like her class is the most important one you'll ever take... when in reality most of the information is forgotten by next year.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science	211	3	3	4	4	737353	11/28/10	Nanette...though she seems like a prison warden she has good intentions. She's sick of dealing with freshman who forget there pencils and id numbers on a test day, which I can understand. She is impeccably clear in all lectures, and labs are designed well. (Perhaps poor grammar) DO NOT DREAD THIS COURS, instead read.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science	101	2	2	4	3	737353	7/13/10	Go to class- that's really all there is to it. Monday at 8:00am ALWAYS sucks but it's the only way you'll do good on her tests which account for 60% of your grade. The other 35% comes from labs, which is where you learn hands on everything that will be on the test. Attendance is done by clickr so GO!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		2	2	2	1	737353	3/28/10	Kind of a hardass. Gets mad at you if you don't read her book ahead of class. I'd be fine with the difficulty of this class if it was stuff that I found interesting or useful, but I don't, so I'm not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	2/1/10	awful professor. does not lecture well. uses other professors for labs. inconsistent. not clear when grading labs. likes to fail students. is not available for office hours. rude on instant messenger. class required full year-3 quarters. don't take her! worst class needed for photography majors. give up your life for this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	10/20/09	Don't take her. Trust me on that one. She has awful grammar and her lectures are not that great. DO NOT TAKE HER. she is the reason why I hate photography so much and switched my majors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		3	1	1	5	737353	4/9/09	Absolutely worst professor I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. She is not only rude and unintelligent but is also a horrible teacher. Talks down to her students and doesn't know the answers to questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science		1	4	4	2	737353	2/1/09	hard but fair. The class is fast paced & is the math & science of photography. You can't pass the tests without studying so SI sessions help. Try to get on her good side early in the year. If she knows you're serious about learning & willing to work hard, she's not so bad. However, her grammar & spelling in her powerpoints & textbook are horrible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science	211	2	3	3	4	737353	10/24/11	Nanette is one tough professor, to say the least. However she is very knowledgeable in her field, and she should be highly respected. You will learn a lot if you take the class seriously. You need to study, do well on the labs, and do the reading. No messing around here. She is intimidating at first, but still a nice person on a one to one basis.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science	101	3	2	3	4	737353	5/16/11	Nanette is super nice one-on-one, but can be extremely irritable in M&P lecture and lab. She will make you feel stupid for asking stupid questions, however she's the best person to have for M&P lab (since she writes the labs...?). She has no sympathy for late work. The iClicker questions are straight from her textbook, look those over before class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science	211	2	5	5	3	737353	1/25/11	Nanette is an amazing professor and an even better person. She's a genius when it comes to her field and pushes students to do their best. She's always there to help; even personal issues out of class. If you are intelligent (and have an interest in learning), you will do very well in this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science	101	4	3	5	4	737353	11/5/10	if you go to class, and occasionally read the text book you'll get a good grade. The test aren't THAT hard.. it's a course for freshmen, and they aren't used to college teaching techniques. Took the course as a second year, people complain cus she doesn't care about personal circumstances.. but she has around 200 students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	2	2	2	737353	5/10/10	She is one of the toughest professors you will come across. I get that she wants to be hard on you so you don't slack off and you learn something but still, shes mean spirited and very sarcastic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science	212	3	4	3	4	737353	3/9/10	I think she is a good professor. You are here to learn, not to befriend your professors. I learned a lot from Nanette. She focuses on the important stuff. If you listen and pay attention, the stuff that's on the tests is the stuff she repeats a lot. I didn't think the tests were hard at all, sometimes the questions would be so simple I'd laugh.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	11/7/09	Worst professor ever. I don't know why RIT hired her to teach freshmen for M&P. If you love photography that much then you basically have to go through hell so you could "stay" in photography.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science		2	4	3	3	737353	4/22/09	Definitely a good suggestion to get on her good side early. Very friendly outside of class and easy to talk to. VERY intelligent. If you're not afraid to speak up and ask questions in lab, she is very helpful. Tests are tough, but an easy B if you study. Getting an A is certainly do-able though if you put in the extra work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science	101	3	4	4	3	737353	2/4/09	I actually like Nanette, a lot of people don't. If she likes you then you will do fine in the end, but if she doesn't know who you are or doesn't like you, you'll have a hard time. Study for the test just like any other class and read the chapter and lab before lecture and you will get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		3	3	1	4	737353	11/18/08	Nanette is all over the place. She's a complete hypocrite when it comes to labs. she says spelling and grammar count but I've had to correct so many grammatical errors not to mention typos from her labs, it's ridiculous. Other than that, she does care about the students. If you show her you're sincere about learning she'll help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		2	1	3	3	737353	10/13/08	Nanette is one of those unfortunate professors who has let her position go to her head. She utilizes the iClicker to conduct polls during class, which count as part of the class grade. She always conducts the first question right at the time the class is scheduled to start to ensure that anyone who is late gets screwed. Pay attention, do labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	3	737353	10/19/07	Nanette is THE worst professor I have ever encountered in my academic life. As an adult student, I recognize her "scare" tactic she uses consistently with the younger students. She is totally condescending and negative. You can approach her, but be ready to be ridiculed. RIT's administration need to completely re-think M&P and Nanette. BAD NEWS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science	123	2	3	3	2	737353	5/2/07	she's not AS terrible as most people make her out to be. she doesn't always convey the information clearly, but if you ask her questions, she'll answer them. she's the best teacher to have for lab, since she makes them up. she knows what answers are supposed to be on them so you get better answers from her on that. and she's an ok person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		2	2	2	4	737353	1/31/07	ug. not helpful at all. ends lecture early even though we're still confused on the material. again, ug.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	10/29/06	"It's in the book" are her answers to all of your questions in this class... 213 out of 300ish students failed the second test... flys through lecture, class gets out early all the time, but if you ask her to go back or slow down..."It's in the book"..."we dont have time to go back all the time"... but class gets out early... hmmmm???
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	10/25/06	VERY HARD CLASS!!! this class is mostly required,if its not required for you, DONT TAKE IT! she is mean, strict and doesnt help often. dont be late, do your labs and you will mostly likely fail all tests. 261 out of 300 students failed the last test. beware!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science		2	3	2	2	737353	2/6/06	She is a hard teacher, and she can be kind of mean to students so dont get on her bad side. If you come to class and study for the exams alot then you should be ok. Just dont make her mad at you its not a good thing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	3	737353	1/30/06	Do your work, or you will fail this class. Awesome teacher, always willing to help at any time. Interesting lectures, until Glen Miller (the subsitute) comes along.. Nanette is very clear, until Glen substitutes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science		1	4	3	5	737353	10/22/07	Very hard professor, very intimidating, fast lecturer. However, she does lecture a class of 300, so it is understandable that she has to move at one pace and cant cater to individuals. However, when 1-on-1, she is often helpful. Test reviews are useless. Very tough class, but still manageable. Labs are easy but tedious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	2	Imaging Science		3	4	4	4	737353	8/14/07	Nanette is a really good teacher but does not like to deal with BS. She wont spoon feed you the information and does not accept ignorance as an answer. If you are having trouble, she will help you. Ask questions in class but make sure there not repetitive. If you still have trouble she will see you outside of class. Be friendly and polite.Thats Key
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science		3	3	3	2	737353	3/15/07	I had Nanette for the first year she was here. She was strict, but she always had time to help. Now she will not help anyone because she has upwards of 300 students. I suggest taking this course in the summer and getting it over and done with. Labs are usually self explanitory, but difficult. Largely math based course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		1	1	1	1	737353	11/22/06	She might be the worst teacher I have ever had in all my college years. She thinks you owe her something bc she is a full time student too..so.."she is busy"(yea like were not?!) anyway, she wont help you bc 'its in the book' and dont try to talk to her..its useless. very strict, I'd almost go as far to say rude. very hard class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	0	Imaging Science		2	1	1	4	737353	10/29/06	SOme call her strict, I prefer "inflexible". She's more willing to help if you're on her good side, and not because your tuition money pays her salary. Openly ridicules students in class, and answers EVERY question (when she has time for them) with "Oh, it's in the book". Lectures feel pointless, work is all from the 60's and feels irrelevant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nanette Salvaggio	2.4	1	Imaging Science		2	2	3	1	737353	10/23/06	Very Very Very hard class. Read the book, do all the labs. Labs help if you don't know what you are doing on the test but even so you might still fail the course. Good Luck. She isn't always the most helpful often stating "It's all in your book"

Rochester Institute of Technology	Donna  Rubin	5.0	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	3	1798054	2/16/13	Took her for a wellness class (Eating, Body Image & Food). Fair, extremely easy, interesting class. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ruggles	4.8	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	1374430	1/27/11	Have the biggest crush on him. Literally one of the most passionate people I have met in my entire life. I wish I was more talented in fine arts, I'd do anything to take another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ruggles	4.8	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	5	4	1374430	4/22/10	Amazing teacher! Great guy, easy to get along with, even better teacher. He helps you as a class or even individually. John only ever pushes you to improve and do your best. He completely changed my view on drawing and helped me learn a lot. A few projects but not too demanding overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ruggles	4.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	3	1374430	4/28/10	overall great guy. really helpful and down to earth. i highly recommend john, he will work with you and certainly improve your drawing skills. he has become a favorite prof of mine. he will make you see drawing in a new light, literally and figuratively. his leniency on tardiness can be a life saver too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ruggles	4.8	2	Fine Arts	101	4	5	5	2	1374430	3/1/10	Ruggles is an awesome teacher. He's young and I think that gives him an edge. No matter what your background in art he'll work with you. He's a good guy and made class worth going to!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts	551	4	5	4	3	273959	12/6/11	I had Patti for Digital Output. I learned more with her than I had from all my photography teachers in 2 years. She is EXPERT at editing and post processing. Shes an amazing resource any photography or print student should take advantage of. Shes not difficult but you will have to ask her to clarify homework assignments. Take questions to her!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	0	Fine Arts		5	2	2	4	273959	4/18/11	Unhealthily disorganized, immature for a professor often.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts	101	5	4	3	5	273959	9/19/10	Patti is amazing!! She is spacey, but shes sooo great. Always willing to help and is just a great person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	0	Fine Arts		5	1	1	1	273959	5/25/06	The most unorganized person I have ever met. Has no idea what is going on w/ the class & in general Changed her mind about assignments at the last minute and nobody knew what they were handing in. I learned NOTHING. At the end she asked how the class went & when we told her how awful it was, she had a fit and then almost cried. Not mentally stable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts		5	5	4	5	273959	11/10/05	Very helpful and interested in you learning the material. PHOTOSHOP QUEEN! Kind of unorganized, but if you ask her about something she'll run back to her office and get whatever she needs to answer your question.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts		4	5	3	5	273959	12/14/04	She is a very busy person and due to that tends to be a little unorganized. However, she will do whatever it takes to help teach and guide a student. She really is there for the students. If you have an interest in Photoshop, rumor has it she is the best on the east coast. TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	NULL	273959	11/3/03	Great teacher...def must have been a hippy cuz she's still rockin the dead-head-wear. A little slow in teaching sometimes but makes class really fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	273959	5/18/11	Incredibly unorganized, really slow at grading, unwilling to meet out of class. Patti knows her stuff but doesn't know how to lecture. Expects students to be post production gods in their first year. Doesn't follow syllabus AVOID IF POSSIBLE take a real photo teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	1	Fine Arts		4	2	3	3	273959	1/31/11	I love Patti, she's such a nice person and she's so much fun to be in class with. You do have to do the work though. She does get a little mad if she feels nobody is actually doing work and she is slow when it comes to grading, but overall I really enjoyed the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts		4	4	3	3	273959	1/7/08	SO. EASY. pretend to be interested/know what you're doing, and she'll totally fall for it. she's good at photoshop, but a total space cadet. big on group projects. usually projects/lectures have nothing to do with the class subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	0	Fine Arts		3	1	3	1	273959	2/20/06	I had a hard time working with her, it was hard to get her to help us out, and she tended to put the deaf student out of the way so that we would be less of a hassle so it seemed. She had a bit of an attitude whenever I talked with her about the assignment. Did Not like her class, avoid when possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	0	Fine Arts		4	2	2	1	273959	9/12/05	after she messed up my final grade, it took her nearly two months to have it changed after i nearly had to get on my knees and beg her to do it. all she had to do is fill out one single form. she seems like a nice person, but when it comes to a student's grades, i suggest that stay on top of it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Patti Russotti	3.4	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	NULL	273959	11/16/03	A little unorganized and and she goes a little fast, but she's a warm and caring teacher and is willing to help anyone with their problems in her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	0	Literature		2	1	1	4	1034327	10/6/10	She is extremely unfair and egoistic, don't know what she is expecting you from papers, I was trying to take notes of her interpretation of texts but that didnt help. She asked me to withdraw, I was shocked
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature		3	4	4	3	1034327	5/18/10	Great class. A lot of reading, though. If you do the reading, attend class, and participate, you'll be fine. And papers are not as hard, she gives you an outline for most of them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature		5	5	5	4	1034327	10/21/09	Cultural and Literary Studies. She was a fair grader. Learn a lot from the class. A lot of reading. Be prepared to not have free time. Watch a lot of movies. Not much homework besides reading response and essay exams (which are time consuming). Keep pages in the limit, or you lose points. Overall, great teacher, great course, highly recommended. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature	210	4	3	4	4	1034327	2/19/09	Hero Literature - was good. explains and analyzes the books read. makes sense and is a fair grader. Uses an online component for discussion of books. Easy class presentations, speak for 3-5 minutes of what you read with your interpretations. Must attend class, even though it's sometimes boring, could miss important handouts or insights on material.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature		2	3	5	5	1034327	8/16/10	The class is quite a bit of work and reading but if you actually do it your will get a good grade. At one point I thought I was going to get a B in the class but then I really stepped it up for my last essay and got an A. You just have to answer everything that she asks for completely and you'll do fine. And actually go to class and discuss!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	1	Literature		2	4	2	5	1034327	11/16/09	you don't have an idea of what she is expecting from your paper. You can take notes and put her interpretations on paper but that doesnt guarantee you will get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	1	Literature	465	3	2	3	1	1034327	5/13/09	Class is Viking Myth and Saga. Class is terribly long and boring. Lots of reading to do. Attendance is mandatory, and she takes attendance twice. Not a hard grader, but do not exceed the maximum page limit on papers, at all. She takes off points. Easy class if you want to do a lot of reading and write 3 moderate length papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature		5	4	4	1	1034327	1/17/08	This woman is a bit old and boring but is a very fair and easy grader. Expects you to read whole novels in 1-2 weeks but only required 3 short papers. I recommend taking her class if you can sit through the boredom... easy grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sandra Saari	3.5	2	Literature	461	1	4	4	3	1034327	10/2/07	LOTS of Reading so make sure you have the time. First you read 100 years of Solitude in the first couple of weeks, use sparknotes to go along with the reading. The you read The House of Spirits and then there's another book. There are also usually 2 short stories that are discussed during each class. videos and take home exams(2) and a paper

Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Sackler	4.6	2	Hospitality	550	5	5	4	4	475951	11/20/07	good teacher inside and outside of class, classes ussually involve some kind of trip off campus. Casino trip was cool, classes were fun, work isn't too hard and there is plenty of room to be creative. I also took FRANCHISING 0619-506 & REALESTATE 0622-205

Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Sackler	4.6	2	Hospitality		5	5	4	5	475951	10/20/04	Really really easy class. You go to Vegas, Canada, really easy A.. the easiest stupidest class I ever took & Warren G is really nice .
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Sackler	4.6	2	Hospitality		5	4	5	1	475951	10/7/09	EASIEST CLASS EVER! Sackler is the man. He is really funny and nice. Had franchising class 10-noon. We could roll in about 20 min late with breakfast and he didnt care. Grade is based on attendance & powerpoint at end of quarter. Had class at Tim Hortons once. Had people come in to present, 1 page write ups, no other homework!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Sackler	4.6	2	Hospitality	550	5	5	5	5	475951	10/23/07	Sackler is awesome. Once class starts, you dont wanna leave. We play casino games all class. tests are kind of tricky but just pay attention and youll do fine. Sackler makes the class a breeze.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Warren Sackler	4.6	2	Hospitality		5	5	3	5	475951	5/17/05	EASY A, Project is all you do, but he provides you with all the information and good examples. Definately will take his classes again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Saeva	5.0	2	Information Technology	360	5	5	5	3	964206	3/8/07	Intro to Database This was an online class. He posted helpful PPs with notes on each slide. If you read the PPs and do the work, you will understand everything. He was very active on the discussion boards and responsive to e-mails. My first online class and I am very impressed. The tests were given online through mycourses. Very good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Selhan Sahin	1.5	0	Economics		4	1	2	1	1596267	7/4/11	Professor Sahin was simply incompetent. Had I not taken AP Macro and known everything already, I would probably have needed the extra credit I asked her for to get my A. At one point, she took off 20 pts on my hw because I got a minor thing wrong on the first part and then she tallied this through the rest of the parts. She is also very unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Salvaggio	4.9	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	4	641956	5/19/12	Carl is an amazing professor. He really knows his stuff, explains things very well, and is *extremely* fair with grading. You will not regret taking a class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Salvaggio	4.9	2	Imaging Science		2	5	4	4	641956	9/17/08	Have to agree with last poster. Carl's an all around good guy and one of the best teachers I've had. If I ever need academic advice, even outside of DIP class, I usually talk to him first. Programs can be hard, but not impossible. Lots of help available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Salvaggio	4.9	2	Imaging Science	211	3	5	5	3	641956	1/26/09	Very good teacher, he is always available to help. The programs can be tough at times, but I recommend starting early and asking for help if you don't understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carl Salvaggio	4.9	2	Imaging Science		3	5	5	5	641956	7/20/05	One of the best professors ever! He knows his stuff and his helpful if you can ever track him down, but that's part of the fun. I would recommend any of his classes. A 10!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolanta Samek	4.3	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	762871	1/24/11	She's great! She requires us to read text book and maintain the French language. Very good grader as well. She sometimes pick a foreign film for us to watch during the class time, it was great :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolanta Samek	4.3	1	Languages		3	3	3	3	762871	11/21/05	Lots of homework but very easy grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolanta Samek	4.3	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	762871	11/25/05	Excellent professor - my writing skills improved a lot in her class. Lots of work but it really helps with practical use of French and doesn't seem like busywork as practicing verb forms and such is. Friendly and interested in helping students learn. No tests or final - all the work is either summaries, papers, film reviews, or presentations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	1	635552	11/5/12	Great woman, has so many hilarious and crazy stories. And she bakes the best brownies. She really wants to see you succeed. Made CRP great for me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	0	Not Specified	101	2	2	2	5	635552	11/23/10	She is flighty, she is overbooked with work and doesnt take the time to help anyone. She is disorganized and is always off task and topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	4	635552	12/10/07	Amazing woman, you gotta love her. It's my first year here and already I'm in CRP, but she helped make the experience so easy and painless for me. To any incoming CRP students, I hope you have her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	3	635552	5/1/07	Very friendly and helpful. She's like having an Elementary School teacher again. Good in a way, but can be a bit annoying. She's a great teacher though, can't go wrong having her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified	101	5	4	4	1	635552	12/1/11	goes off into tangents a lot but she genuinely wants students to be happy in their major so it balances out. extremely easy class, it's almost impossible to not get an a.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	3	635552	4/15/10	Very helpful teacher! She was really laid back and gave good insight about what to pick for a major. Highly recommended!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Pat Sanborn	4.5	2	Not Specified		5	5	5	5	635552	8/21/07	such a nice woman, helped me out choosing a major, very funny, so glad i was put with her

Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	0	Languages		3	1	3	5	916204	8/17/09	Does not provide an encouraging learning environment in her classroom. Willing to tell you if your doing something wrong but offers no encouragement in how to fix it. Does not provide constructive feedback.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	2	Languages		2	3	5	4	916204	4/9/08	If you think she's strict I feel sorry for the first time your peer reviewed or reviewed by your interpreting teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	0	Languages		1	1	2	5	916204	10/29/07	Honestly, she is an average teacher at best. Yes, she is profound in ASL, but my personal experiences have all been unfair. She relies on MyCourses entirely too much and doesn't give credit for your work for ridiculous reasons. My advice...if you don't want 10 weeks of frustration and dissapointment, take someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	2	Languages		2	4	4	5	916204	3/12/07	Fantastic Teacher. Is proficient in ASL and knows how to teach it well. Can be strict at times, but for good reason. I strongly recommend taking courses with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	1	Languages	301	2	1	5	5	916204	11/4/08	Take this class if you want your self esteem to be crushed. offers help only if your her favorite.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	1	Languages		2	2	3	4	916204	11/1/07	Strict. If there's a fault in your signing, she'll find it. She'll find it and tell you you're wrong, and then find something else you're doing wrong. I think I got a great deal out of taking her class for 10 weeks, I think I really improved, but it does wear you down a bit. Doesn't make constructive criticisms, just criticisms.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Sanders	3.1	2	Languages		2	5	5	5	916204	5/17/07	Wonderful teacher! Yes, she's strict, but for a good reason. You'll learn more with her than any of the other teachers and your signing will improve immensely, which is the point.

Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		4	5	4	1	479069	1/11/06	He's definitely on the side of the students. Since the department in general doesn't seem to be, this is a very good thing indeed. Sandifer's lectures aren't exactly exciting, but be sure to go the one or two before a test. He will do all he can to help. He's easy to contact and responds to e-mails promptly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	3	479069	7/4/05	Sandifer is the best chem. teacher ever. I hate chemistry and never understood much of it and Sandifer had me completely understanding it all simply by being in lecture and listening. He is so clear and he really knows his material, and he knows how to make it interesting. A++ deffinitely the man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	4	479069	1/11/05	Posts his lectures PPT files on MyCourses, so no need to go to lecture. Fights for better tests and wants to see his classes suceed. Awesome guy with interesting sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	5	479069	10/21/05	Sandifer is pretty cool guy. His lectures are boring though and I always zone out. But he really cares about his students and does everything he can to ensure that we succeed. He always makes sure everything is fair. He's a nice guy with a sense of humor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		4	4	4	3	479069	2/17/05	A good and funny teacher. Slept through most of the lectures but had some interesting conversations with him outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Sandifer	4.5	2	Chemistry		3	4	3	2	479069	10/25/04	Read the book and you won't need to attend lecture, go to lecture and likely fall asleep. He will argue with superiors for fairer tests and wants to see his classes succeed... as a whole. Recitations are very helpful, and he's quite funny and approachable.

Rochester Institute of Technology	K.S.V. Santhanam	2.8	0	Materials Science & Eng.		3	1	1	1	67476	10/22/05	The worst professor ever, and the most unhelpful director of materials science that we can have

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	0	Writing	319	3	1	1	2	1634309	4/8/13	Is not all that he is cracked up to be. He is extremely unclear about what he wants and has a poor choice in books to discuss.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing	449	5	5	5	5	1634309	11/8/12	Absolutely the best writing professor at RIT. Sarnowski is extraordinarily chill and friendly. Grading is fair, and you get the vibe that he really wants to help you improve your writing. Do whatever you can do to get his classes, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing		3	5	5	3	1634309	2/17/12	He puts in the effort of being a great teacher. He tries to get you to think really deeply. He cares about students and makes himself available and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	1634309	11/1/11	Best writing seminar professor there is!He gives 1 essay per week(2 pages)and little reading. Taking class with him really improved my writing skills. Gotta work to get the A though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing		4	5	5	1	1634309	3/2/13	Great professor. Very chill and flexible guy. His class is not very hard. Participation is required. He is a fair grader. Everything in the class is easy except for midterm and final paper which can be lengthly and challenging. If you're fine with writing long (8 pages minimum) essays, you'll be fine with this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing	227	5	5	5	1	1634309	2/27/12	I had Sarnowski for Writing Seminar this past quarter. I have one way to sum it up: DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET INTO HIS CLASS. You will NOT regret it. Essays are easy, you get feedback on everything, the readings are interesting, and class discussions are awesome. The book was cheap, too, <$20 online. Sarnowski made a 10am class WORTH IT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Sarnowski	4.4	2	Writing	449	5	5	5	4	1634309	1/27/12	The effort he puts into his teaching really shows. Mad Men on the recommended materials list? Check. Philosophically interesting class discussions? Double-check. He even managed to get a visiting international movie producer to visit the class for a one-on-one interview. (No guarantee for future classes, but it's testament to his awesomeness.)

Not only knows his stuff but is good at conveying the message. He is not only a great teacher but a Hooah Sgt., Moral guy, and a personal role model. Show him the respect he deserves and do what he asks and you'll get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Sauerwald	4.8	2	Army ROTC	201	4	5	5	4	1078561	10/21/08	A great guy, really cares about helping his students be all they can. Basically: show up, do what's expected of you, and be respectful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	1	Biotechnology		2	3	3	3	231022	10/26/12	His tests are difficult and you need to understand/know the material well. His classes can drag but he throws a joke here and there. He does know his stuff, he's not really just reading off slides, he explains
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	0	Biotechnology		1	1	1	1	231022	10/18/11	If you take his class you are making the biggest mistake of your life. He does not know how to teach and his test are impossible! He tries to be funny but fail at it! His is not approachable at all!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	1	Biotechnology		1	3	3	4	231022	5/29/10	Tests are horrible. He's nice, but a little boring. Rarely adds anything to ppt in lecture so absence doesn't hurt. Too much material for most people (even brainiacs) to memorize in the time allowed in RIT's miserable quarter system. Don't get me started on that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	1	Biotechnology		3	3	3	3	231022	10/23/05	A little too animated for my taste.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	1	Biotechnology	205	1	2	3	3	231022	11/24/10	Tests are HARD! Classes are boring and he drags on for half the allotted 3 hour lab time. Do not recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	1	Biotechnology	416	1	3	3	4	231022	10/24/08	An ok teacher. Tests are really ridiculously hard. Must know to heart ALL material whih is almost impossible. Teaches like you'd assume tests and material are easy, but no. Labs were ok but kind of the same thing over and over. Overall just ok... and be prepared for the evil tests!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Savka	2.7	2	Biotechnology		3	5	5	4	231022	2/16/05	Good teacher, not that great in intro to cell bio but in plant biotech he has more interest for the material. Tests are a little tough but if you keep up you should do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	1	Communication		2	2	3	3	500199	7/24/11	Plays favorites. If he decides he likes you, you can get away with anything. If not, you're screwed. He has no leniency with assignments at all. He's now the head of the communication department, which scares me a little.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication		4	4	4	2	500199	2/15/07	Great and easy going teacher. Fun class! Recommend him for any writing class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	4	4	500199	5/2/06	So inspiring! He grades hard it may take you a while to figure out what he wants. I loved class discussion and you will find yourself actually enjoying the analysis. I highly recommend him to anyone that is willing to have some passion about school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication		4	5	5	1	500199	4/3/05	Aside from being one of the nicest guys on the face of the earth, Pat is entertaining and informative in his classes. If you do the work, you will do well in his class. Highly recommend him to everyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication	446	4	5	5	5	500199	7/11/11	Extremely helpful. Had him for Professional Writing and Writing the Technical Manual. Probably the best professor I've had. He is all about practical knowledge and he runs many of his classes in an open lecture/discussion format. Very easy going and will go out of his way to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication	444	2	5	5	4	500199	8/28/06	Expected to get little out of the tech writing class, but learned a ton, and I've been writing various documents for a long time. He provided quite a bit of high-quality feedback. I felt challenged, which is cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patrick Scanlon	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	500199	9/15/05	This guy is so frickin sweet I agree, he knows his stuff as well and you have some fun in the class upon occassion. He is like really down to earth so theres no bs, really - basically he either bores u to death (if ur that kind of person that gets bored easily) or you'll love him. Most people love him, I do, hes awesome, so frickin nice its crazy

Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	0	Fine Arts		4	2	2	2	559903	6/2/11	Ms. Maggie is a really sweet and nice person but is the worst foundation teacher to have. She gives out pointless projects and assignments that are completely irrelevant to 3D. She creates ridiculous interpretations of projects and doesn't actually critique. She is very passionate and I respect her but her class was a joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	4	559903	10/13/08	Here's the deal with Miss. Maggie: if you don't care, you will hate her. If you DO care, it will be one of the more enjoyable core required courses. She is so passionate and full of life that you can't help but feel it yourself. But if you have no emotion and no respect for the class or the school, she will seem like a person just giving busy work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	2	Fine Arts		4	5	4	3	559903	2/6/06	Miss. Maggie is a sweet lady, her class is relatively easy, her sketchbook assignments are insane, in my eyes, busywork. The critques are not that great, no one tells you what's wrong with your work or what can be improved. My skill level didn't improve significantly. She's easy to please.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	4	3	2	559903	1/23/05	Ms. Maggie is one of the sweetest ladies ever. That aside, I would really not want to take her class again. Her sketch book journal requirements are a little too much to keep up with. I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over. I didn't see any improvement in my work or skill level.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	1	Fine Arts		1	2	3	4	559903	10/21/09	Horrible Professor does not help you at all. Grades Ridiculously hard, Have heard nothing but complaints from both of her sections. She is a nice lady but should not be teaching anymore. First day of class said she only gives out MAYBE one A a year, however that rarely happens, If you are looking to do well your first year DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	0	Fine Arts	101	5	1	1	1	559903	6/20/08	HANDS DOWN THE WORSE TEACHER OF ALL TIME. HEY KIDS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ARTS AND CRAFTS GO TO THE PARK AND GET OUT THE POPSICLE STICKS AND THE ELMERS GLUE. WANT TO MAKE "YOUR SOUL" OUT OF CLAY? WANT TO KEEP AN "OBSERVATION DIARY"?? THEN THIS IS THE CLASS FOR YOU!! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU IDIOTS ARE PAYING FOR THIS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Maggie Scheid	3.3	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	559903	8/26/05	She loves you to the soul. She truely cares about your growth as a person along with what you create. A best friend, a mentor, and some one who I will remember till the day i die.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Sanchez	4.5	2	English	502	2	3	4	5	1341014	12/24/11	She's one of the youngest professors! I've had her for Written Communication I and II. Now I'm taking Writing Seminar with her! She's really good at teaching Writing courses! But she's a tough grader! You have to do WELL on these papers! Trust me!! Take her!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Sanchez	4.5	2	English		3	5	5	4	1341014	10/18/11	Attendance is very important! I suggest you that you don't talk in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Sanchez	4.5	2	English		3	5	5	4	1341014	10/18/11	Attendance is very important! I suggest you that you don't talk in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Sanders	4.5	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	4	1186746	10/26/12	Even though the subject matter is awful, Sanders presents it well. Only had online but he was always fair and allowed work to be done mostly on own sched. Even discussion posts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Sanders	4.5	2	Philosophy	509	3	4	4	3	1186746	9/11/09	I had this professor for two onlines classes. Both time he has been very clear on what he wants. He gives you plenty of opportunity to get a better grade and improve your test scores. You can always go back to improve. He is flexible and willing to work with you. There is a lot of reading and you won't pass if you don't read the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Sanders	4.5	2	Philosophy		1	5	5	2	1186746	4/29/10	Took Sanders for Philosophy and Business Ethics. His classes are complex. You absolutely must acquire the books and do all of the readings as well as participate with legitimate, researched responses to discussions. You can ace to class if you write well consistently and keep retaking quizzes. Very knowledgeable. looks like a greek philosopher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		5	4	4	1	264428	3/23/13	I've taken Professor Santana quite a few times now and I really love his classes. Very easy and as long as you keep up with the online discussions then it's pretty easy to get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		4	4	3	2	264428	11/12/11	Funny presentation, lectures are good but might not help you write your papers as much as talking with him after class. Textbook material can be extremely dense to work through. What sets him apart is that he actually gives comprehensive, extremely helpful feedback on rough drafts. Not a stressful class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	0	English	101	3	1	1	3	264428	10/21/09	what an awful teacher! he makes lots of sexual jokes that aren't offensive, but also aren't funny to anyone but him. he's pretty much just obnoxious. and a needlessly picky grader on papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	0	English		1	1	2	1	264428	4/13/09	DO NOT BOTHER PAYING ATTENTION. none of the material covered in his lectures appear on any type of quiz or test. quizzes, papers, and online discussions make up your grades, and they are all based on extremely difficult readings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		2	5	5	3	264428	4/24/07	Best ever i've taken two classes with him and i plan to take more next year.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	1	English		5	3	3	2	264428	2/9/06	The class was a joke, but an easy A. The lectures that didn't put everyone to sleep were actually rather entertaining, becuase of his irreverence. However, he DOES inject all his lectures with his lefty political views. If you are a conservative, be prepared for his ignorant stabs at the right wing, and his anti-war propaganda.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		5	5	3	3	264428	6/22/05	You'll learn more than you think, just nothing about writing or literature.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		4	4	5	NULL	264428	10/28/03	cool teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		4	4	4	4	264428	3/10/12	very good professor! I took his online writing class, it was easy if you do all the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		5	5	3	1	264428	4/29/10	Ive had Santana for writing and for literature. He is by far one of the most agreeable teachers at RIT. Writing is not a fun class to take but he was able to keep hilarious discussions flowing and still teach at the same time. He is never angered unless you interrupt his class and makes fun of you if you walk in late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	1	English		5	1	5	1	264428	10/6/09	Nice guy but doesn't really respond to emails much. He's into discussions and comparisons, very vague on assignments and flexible on grading. Just do the homework and show up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English	101	5	5	4	3	264428	2/24/09	best teacher i've ever had. so laid back and fun. wrote about your own personal experiences
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		4	4	4	2	264428	6/6/06	he is a really good guy, funny likes to joke and he knows when he is being boring. pretty fun class with good videos and 1 time a video game.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		5	4	4	4	264428	9/21/05	guys crazy good teacher tho
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Santana	3.6	2	English		4	3	4	2	264428	1/11/05	We didn't learn ANYTHING... All he did was talk with the morons in my learning community about cars, booze, and sex... Great prof to get if you're a slacker...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kalathur Santhanam	1.5	0	Chemistry	101	4	1	1	1	826804	1/31/08	horrible teacher, easy A. Half the time you can't understand what he's trying to say, and the other half is directly out of the text book. Will not admit when he makes a mistake. Says the book isn't really needed, but then has entire classes on just questions in the book. Just don't go to class, and you'll ace it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kalathur Santhanam	1.5	1	Chemistry	271	4	3	2	2	826804	11/16/06	hard to understand, hes not a bad teacher, tests are basily class examples so kinda easy if you pay attention
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kalathur Santhanam	1.5	0	Chemistry		2	1	1	2	826804	10/21/07	bad prof. learn nothing except reading the text. he is bassically running through 2 slides per second throught the whole quater.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	0	Fine Arts	101	3	2	2	2	353884	7/23/08	she didn't help very much she would just stand behind you and look over your shoulder for 2 minutes then walk away with out giving you any comments. she thought we were completely stupid and had no idea how to use color [it was a pre-college portfolio prep class]. it was a great class, really gives you a head start for AP art, highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	0	Fine Arts		4	1	1	1	353884	8/24/05	i thought that she completely ruled against any creativity of the individual and i personally disliked all of her teaching stratagies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	353884	1/23/05	She has awful taste in art. She doesn't like work that isn't "controversial." Her critiques aren't helpful, they are just long and repetitive. Her instructions aren't clear. She doesn't like to let you have freedom on projects. She would rather you be all the same, than think outside the box.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	2	Fine Arts		5	5	4	5	353884	10/16/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	4	353884	7/7/05	I would not reccomend this teacher. She is unclear and does not like to give freedom on projects. She is invested in her own work more than helping students learn. AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Sardisco	2.3	1	Fine Arts		4	3	2	NULL	353884	2/16/04	Loves to talk and crit, very easy the first quarter, gets tougher and less clear as you get into color in the second quarter. Average teacher, average assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	1	Physics		5	2	3	2	1756042	4/12/13	Wasn't particularly exciting, and I wasn't too keen on taking Physics for the third year in a row (two times in high school, both AP courses). However, the course became much more interesting when I realized she was from Texas and sounded like Sandy Cheeks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	1	Physics		3	3	3	1	1756042	2/25/13	Professor Sassin wasn't a bad professor by any means, she just wasn't particularly engaging. The fact that I dislike math and science probably didn't help in this matter, but even so, the class was rather dull all around. That said, she does seem to have a vested interest in your learning the material, and wants you to do well. Overall, she's fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	2	Physics	211	3	4	3	3	1756042	11/15/12	Pretty sure this was her first time ever teaching, and that was apparent, but she is a very fair teacher and will work with anyone who puts in effort and wants to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	0	Physics	212	4	2	2	2	1756042	10/28/12	Class is easy when you do the pre lab and post lab quizzes. Don't mess up on them, tests are rather difficult, I suggest reading through the book even though she wont tell you to. Overall I did well in this class. Labs are disorganized and don't expect any help with them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	2	Physics		3	3	5	1	1756042	3/4/13	Explains concepts very well compared to Physics teachers I've had in the past. She is sometimes difficult to contact outside of class, but when you are able to reach her, she can be really helpful. Tests are pretty easy, but the pre/post-lab quizzes can deceptively tricky sometimes. I would recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	2	Physics	211	4	4	3	1	1756042	2/16/13	Fun teacher, really quite good. She assumes you're pretty strong with math/algebra, and goes pretty fast. Very fair and helpful. If you must take physics, take it with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kelly  Sassin	3.1	2	Physics		4	4	3	3	1756042	11/12/12	I think this was the first class she's taught but overall she did a decent job. The lectures and labs aren't mandatory but I highly recommend going. She is usually there after the lab to help you out if you need it. Her class might be boring sometimes but now I know a lot more about physics than I did in the beginning of the quarter.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Scales	3.9	2	History		3	5	4	3	1666461	3/8/12	Very good teacher. Classes are lectures. Graded on attendance and exam grades. There is no textbook reading required. But there are handouts to read and short novels/ stories.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Scales	3.9	2	History		2	5	5	4	1666461	2/9/12	great teacher. very knowledgable. she will help u if you need it pay attention and come to class and the reading u can get from spark notes. it's an easy b a harder a.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Scales	3.9	0	History		1	1	1	1	1666461	2/1/12	Bad teacher, expects too much from students. Save yourself the W and don't take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Scales	3.9	2	History	101	5	5	5	2	1666461	2/13/12	You're graded on attendance and written exams. No homework and some extra credit opportunities. If you're good with a lecture style class, I would highly recommend. She's not the most interesting teacher, but the workload is very small, if you're good at memorization during a lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Scales	3.9	2	History		5	3	5	4	1666461	2/2/12	Her lectures can get boring, but overall her class is very easy. She counts attendance, so make sure you come to class. Your only grades are from 3 tests, but they are very reasonable and easy. The materials are from class discussions. Take her if you want an easy A!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		4	4	4	3	14223	1/25/06	Bill Scarbrough is the only man who ever challenged Chuck Norris and won. I still have no idea what we did in his class, but it didn't matter because he grades really easy. Don't mess with him or you'll get a 4 jawed chuck to the face. Many references to funnels and his wife make for interesting classes. Bill Scarbrough, God among men. Alllriight.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	14223	11/2/05	*thumbs up* Great teacher. I enjoyed his teaching style thoroughly. You learn a lot and the class is quick paced, but he is very approachable if you need help. Clearly enjoys his job and is extremely knowledgeable due to a long time spent in the industry. Very funny guy. Glad to have had him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		2	4	4	2	14223	1/11/05	Awesome guy, knows his****, and is funny...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	14223	3/15/07	Bill Scarborough...really funny guy, makes people laugh a lot during class. Not sure what we learned, but the whole class got an A so it's all good. He'll entertain you with stories about the Delphi days.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	14223	3/8/06	He is an amazing teacher. His class was the most fun, most interesting, and by far the most enjoyable class I have ever taken. If you ever need any help with anything not only the class he is teaching he is more than willin to help you. ABSOLUTLY take him if you have the choice. He makes jokes all the time so his classes are very layed back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Scarbrough	4.5	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	14223	11/17/05	My favorite class of the week. If you can take a class with him do it you will be much better off than with any other professor. This class was the best.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jacob Schanker	5.0	2	Electrical Engineering		4	5	5	3	824338	3/26/06	Great professor! Has industry experience and shares with the students. Assigns but doesn't grade homework, treats students as responsible adults. Tests were very fair and was very helpful in labs.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	447	4	5	4	5	1113117	11/16/12	Great professor for ab. psych. 4 exams with one drop including cumulative final if you choose not to take it. One paper but it's easy and opinion based. Lectures are fun and there are TONS of great videos. extra credit adds 4 points to your average! Take a course with her if you can!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	212	3	3	5	5	1113117	11/29/11	Abnormal Psy -- great class with Dr. Schenkel. She makes all of the lectures very interesting and combines them with movies. Excellent Professor!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology		1	5	4	4	1113117	8/17/11	Good class. Tests can be hard. Study the lectures and class notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	1	Psychology		3	2	4	5	1113117	4/25/11	She's pretty knowledgeable and gives you good, solid information. She doesnt take the time to even learn your names and doesn't care if you show up to class. Tests are straight from the powerpoints and videos.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	447	1	5	5	3	1113117	9/4/10	Good Prof. Tests are clear and straight from lecture. Study from the slides and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	1	Psychology	447	4	2	4	2	1113117	6/18/10	This ended up being one of my favorite classes for the quarter. You're only graded on 3 exams and an essay so you have to be careful and do lots of extra credit. My only complaint was that we wasted 10-20 minutes a day while she figured out how to get a DVD to work. Lectures were interesting and full of videos and examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	220	3	5	5	5	1113117	9/19/09	Dr. Schenkel is absolutely awsome!! She is the BEST!! Her presentations are succint to the relevent material and yet she can make the material come ALIVE. Psych is not my major, but because of her teaching, level of caring for the student, and exteme helpfulness, I would LOVE to take another class of hers. I would HIGHLY reccommend her to all!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	1	Psychology	220	2	2	3	3	1113117	4/29/09	Not the best professor. She plays a dumb blonde a lot of the time. Her voice and facial expressions were really annoying. The textbook was so boring I never opened it. Her lectures didn't help for the tests. I wouldn't recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	1113117	10/16/08	She is one of my favorite professors that I've had thus far. The tests are from the textbook and the powerpoints, which are posted online. The book is very technical and boring, but she makes it interesting when she presents it to the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology		3	4	5	5	1113117	4/28/08	Awesome prof.Good lectures, take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology		3	5	5	5	1113117	6/2/12	Had her for psychological testing. Interesting class. Some fun assignments but a good amount of work .. A lot due at the end. She is really good.. Knows what she is talking about. I would take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	447	4	3	5	5	1113117	11/17/11	Great teacher, certainly not timely with grading though. All you gotta do is show up and know the lectures and videos.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology		4	3	5	5	1113117	6/6/11	very interesting information, very nice professor. she uses videos a lot which keep it interesting, but goes through power points really fast. tests get harder as the quarter goes, but if you know the book, you will get an A. also, lots of extra credit opportunity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	549	1	5	5	5	1113117	10/31/10	I love this class. A lot of good information. One of my favorite professors at RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	441	2	5	5	4	1113117	9/1/10	Had her for abnormaol. Great Class. Lectures were interesting. A lot of good information and good videos. She kept it very interesting and went off topic to talk about cases. Four exams, she takes the top 3. Study from the powerpoints. I would take her again, plus she is pretty cute!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	0	Psychology	229	1	1	2	2	1113117	10/30/09	She is very discriminatory against foreign students. Boring lectures...all she does is read from PPT..isn't helpful at all...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	121	3	5	5	5	1113117	9/19/09	Dr. Schenkel has been the absolute BEST!! She is extremely helpful and insightful, and I have learned so much from her in just the 1 class. Her presentations are succint,material is up to date and relevant to what is tested, plus she makes it very interesting and really holds the attention of the class. I would not hesitate to reccommend her at all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	0	Psychology		4	2	2	3	1113117	3/15/09	She has had the same powerpoints for the past few years. She just reads them to you while you fill in the blanks in your handouts. She gave out 4 point of extra credit on your average and the final is optional. 3 Tests, 1 final - she will take the best 3 grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lindsay Schenkel	4.1	2	Psychology	210	2	5	5	4	1113117	5/2/08	One of the best teachers I have had at RIT, and psychology isn't even my major! Extremely kind and easy to get along with. Tests are multiple choice, and come straight from powerpoint lectures. Lots of information, but she makes it interesting. I would love to take another one of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Jay Schillaci	3.2	0	Physics		2	2	2	4	1265350	5/17/10	He seems like a nice guy, but concentrates way too much on math that is not really used in the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Jay Schillaci	3.2	2	Physics	311	3	3	5	4	1265350	1/25/10	We got this guy 3 weeks into the quarter. My main problem with him is all the mistakes he makes on the board. It's my first time learning most of this but it just makes so little sense that I can still pick out the mistakes. Class is pretty much pointless. I sleep through most of it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Jay Schillaci	3.2	2	Physics		4	4	3	4	1265350	4/24/10	I was also in the section that got him 3 weeks into the quarter. Overall, he's pretty good. He uses power point to lecture, but sometimes lectures for far too long. But the PPTs make it very clear, at least. As stated before, he definitely makes a lot of mistakes on the board and generally seems to lack confidence while lecturing. I recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Corinna Schlombs	4.5	2	History		5	5	5	4	1487942	11/30/11	A very interesting and cultured woman, a few in the class were upset when they learned they couldn't skate away by not paying attention. Do not expect to show up and text your sorority sisters the entire time and expect a good grade. She takes her job seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Corinna Schlombs	4.5	2	History		5	4	4	1	1487942	10/27/10	She talks A LOT.. She gets interesting when the topic gets interesting, but for Modern European History, MOST of the topics are interesting so you're good there. Her work is not unbearable, one page analysis every other week and she is not a harsh grader. Not a bad teacher at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans Schmitthenner	4.3	2	Chemistry	266	3	5	3	5	1648481	7/23/12	I had him for my gen chem lab and both quant labs. He is an amazing professor. Sooo helpful! He even came in on a Saturday to help me with quant lecture material. He is a very fair grader and gives you plenty of time to complete assignments. If you have the chance, choose him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans Schmitthenner	4.3	2	Chemistry	266	5	5	3	4	1648481	5/10/12	Dr. Hans is a very nice lab professor. He is extremely helpful and has a very generous late work policy. He may seem a bit confused at time, but he will do whatever he has to in order to ensure you understand what your doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans Schmitthenner	4.3	2	Chemistry	255	5	4	4	4	1648481	11/18/11	amazing lab professor. explains everything however many times you need to understand. easy grading system. accepts late work no matter how late. very sympathetic to personal problems & stress. goes out of his way to make female students welcome. overall great guy. i wish he taught all intro chem courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans Schmitthenner	4.3	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	1	1648481	5/17/12	Spectacular professor for lab. easily accessible outside of class. will look at drafts of reports and give you feedback. not very strict about due dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hans Schmitthenner	4.3	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	1648481	1/17/12	Dr.Hans is a wonderful teacher t have. He is very lax in class and in his grading and is very understanding on multiple situations. He is always willing to listen and I've gone to him multiple times about other classes and he is always wiling to help. Take a class with him if you have the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts	505	5	5	5	2	1631305	12/1/12	Awesome teacher! If you need to get a liberal arts credit, look no further than this guy. He even alludes to memes occasionally and is an extremely funny professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts		5	4	4	3	1631305	5/24/12	Very easy class. A few projects and assignments here and there. Participation is a big part of the overall grade and so just say a bunch of random thoughts in class. Easy A for a lib art class. Prof is funny and makes random awkward remarks, grades easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts	101	5	5	5	2	1631305	11/3/11	Great teacher, understanding and tries to make his classes fun for everyone, even if you dont want to take it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	1	1631305	11/14/12	One of the best, if not the best professor you would ever ask for a LA course. Very easy going, friendly, funny, and extremely helpful. He likes what he's doing, that's why you would probably like it, too. Project +Assignments, attendance, and participation - get it done and you have your A; all of which are not crazy hard at all. TAKE HIM!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts	213	5	5	5	5	1631305	11/8/11	This guy is freaking hilarious! I have never had a class at RIT that was as interesting, fun, and easy as his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Schnapp	4.8	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	1	1631305	11/2/11	He is an awesome teacher. Very friendly and easy to talk to. Has no exams in any of his classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	3	1028831	2/25/12	He's a great teacher that is very engaging. He doesn't give out homework since everything is done in class. Pay attention and take good notes you'll get an A. Everything is open books and notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	1028831	7/21/11	Awesome professor for juvenile justice. Great notes and sense of humor. Great field trip to industry school. Highly reccomend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	4	5	4	4	1028831	1/27/10	Great Professor, knows his stuff and he's funny
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	4	4	3	1028831	11/15/08	This teacher is a great professor, he uses humor and well thought out examples to make you understand topics. The exams are a bit rough, they focus on small areas in the power points and can make them a bit difficult. Class is based on 3 exams and one big research paper which isn't bad at all. Great teacher, but demands some extra work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	440	4	5	5	5	1028831	7/23/11	Professor Schreck is a great Professor. For 10 am he is very engaging. I enjoyed the lectures and field trip.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	5	1028831	2/16/10	Great class, teaches great, every one in criminal justice should take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	3	1028831	2/17/09	Research methods II is all math compared to the first course, but Schreck makes the class extremely simple. His powerpoints and method of teaching are clear and easy to understand. The four tests get easier as you go and the class goes by quickly. Definitely recommend taking this class with Schreck, it won't be as hard as people make it out to be
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Schreck	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	4	5	5	4	1028831	9/12/07	You know those sappy movies about a teacher that is so good that he motivates and changes an impossible group of students? I'd always figured that was an impossible cliche until I took classes with Dr. Schreck. I was no picnic in undergrad. In fact I was lazy, ignorant and immature. To inspire my 20 yr old self was quite a feat, but he managed to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Schrlau	3.0	1	Engineering		4	3	3	3	1650306	11/21/11	Brand new prof. Nice guy. Knows what he's talking about but sometimes gets flustered and makes mistakes. Takes a long time deriving equations. Goes very slowly compared to other professors. Very helpful and nice when going to see him out of class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	4	298698	3/7/11	I have no idea why anyone let this guy teach. He doesn't actually DO anything. He basically sends the class off on a treasure hunt with promises of discovery and capitalistic adventure. Then he turns around, slaps a final exam on you and takes credit for your work. WORST TEACHER EVER!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science	555	3	1	1	1	298698	1/7/10	Pompous professor who has a a ridiculous infatuation for bicycles.. His idea of "innovation" and "invention" is to pretty much make students work on his biking projects. Pretty useless class, take Schull ONLY if the course is absolutely required.. otherwise find something else or another professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science	426	1	2	1	2	298698	11/20/07	Very confusing class - I didn't know what was going on until the 3rd week of class. Tons of outside-class work in groups is very hard to coordinate schedules with. Knows his stuff and sometimes helpful if you go to him, but he sometimes is too concerned with his own projects. Class is really disorganized and grading is often unclear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science		3	2	1	2	298698	11/19/06	Jon is a nice guy but he is very unorganized. Case in point, I still have no idea what i have in his class and all of the other professors have put their grades on SIS. He has wild cockamanee schemes including manta rays and lights. He is all over the place. One day, we sat and played with knex all class. The class was also a waste of time/joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	1	298698	2/23/05	Oh, my, GOD. Most disorganized teacher I've ever had - final presentation of projects covered three classes, three rooms, and we had to review all 15 projects in TWO HOURS, all the while manning our own project. Does NOT tell you what he expects of you so far as projects go - disorganized++++.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science		3	3	1	NULL	298698	11/25/03	did not follow syllabus, students dont' have a clue as to how they are doing in the class!! grading scheme is horrible! very unorginized!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science	555	2	1	1	4	298698	4/26/10	John Schull = Daniel Plainview in both appearance and behavior. His class consists of setting a group of smart students off in some direction, then taking all the credit for anything they come up with. If you watch the end of "There will be Blood", just substitute "I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!" with "I STEAL YOUR WORK!".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science	555	4	1	1	1	298698	5/15/08	Most frustrating professor I have ever had. Knocks down any idea you have, and doesn't let you make the 'innovation and invention' class productive. Tells you what direction to go, and is in love with his ideas, and hates anyone elses. Wasted my time, and made me throw away so much work he had originally told me was great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	1	Computer Science		5	3	3	1	298698	4/1/07	He's a pretty nice guy who has this thing with his flying mantaray. Honestly, I did not see the point of Freshman Seminar but I still had to go. There were several times I didn't do my work but he still gave me an A. I think it was because I kept apologizing for not doing the work and attended all the classes anyway. :/
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jon Schull	1.4	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	2	298698	6/19/05	very disorganized, expects way too much from the students, especially out of class assignments, extremely indecisive on grading and what is going on in the class

Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Schwartz	4.3	2	Science	501	4	4	5	4	814775	11/12/11	Paul is very laid back and easy going. He cares about what your doing, but lets you go at your own pace and work when you want. Can get a little talkative about some subject, but he always means well. Great guy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Schwartz	4.3	2	Science	206	5	5	5	1	814775	3/3/10	Very nice guy, easy grader. He is happy to answer questions about lab procedures. As long as you show up and do your lab, you're guaranteed an 80+. I showed up to lab late many times, still willing to help me. He might not have known what was going on all the time because this was his first quarter leading a lab at RIT. I highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Schwartz	4.3	2	Science		3	4	4	2	814775	6/9/08	Really nice guy and fair teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Schwartz	4.3	2	Science	206	4	4	4	4	814775	1/30/11	He is honestly a really nice guy and tries to be interactive with his students. He always tried to explain the experiment beyond what we just went in and did and explained how it could relate in a real world setting. This was helpful and overall his grading was extremely fair too. I would strongly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Schwartz	4.3	2	Science		5	3	5	5	814775	2/27/10	He's a nice enough guy... it was suppose to be a 8am lab and he's like... yeah were gonna go ahead and make this a 9am. The only things was the he kinda didn't know what was going on, probably because he's not suppose to be doing this!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Schell	4.3	2	Music		3	5	5	4	1101127	3/16/13	He is an extremely helpful professor. His lectures are well organized and consists of many examples worked on by the entire class. He makes sure that you know the material very well. Be prepared for homework assignments every class. If you do not sing and/or play piano, be prepared to spend a lot of time practicing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Schell	4.3	2	Music	449	3	5	4	5	1101127	2/26/12	If you want an A, you better have a lot of free time and/or a strong background in music. Expect frequent homework and plenty of class participation. He's a great professor and will make sure that you learn, you just have to put in the effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Schell	4.3	2	Music	449	3	5	4	5	1101127	4/21/11	Good teacher, nice guy. He cares about his students and cares if you learn. He gives alot of homework which you MUST take seriously if you want to pass the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Schell	4.3	2	Music	449	2	5	5	4	1101127	3/1/12	Good professor. Knows music and keeps the class moving. Has a good sense of humor and is down-to-earth. The exams can be a little challenging, especially with no musical background. Attend all classes and read the text if you want to receive an A or a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Schell	4.3	1	Music		2	3	3	4	1101127	4/24/11	horrible professor... rushes through the material and doesn't provide examples, just expects you to know it... not very helpful outside of class either

Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics	305	2	2	2	2	67417	4/30/11	Ask him about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at the University of Chicago
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics	319	2	1	2	1	67417	11/10/08	If you can't teach yourself material, do not take this class. He reads straight from the text book, which makes more sense often times than his lectures. I attended every single class and still ended up learning more from reading the text book. Do not expect to get an A in this course. He is only lenient on medical issues when I missed 1 week
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	4	67417	10/20/08	You will teach yourself the material, count on it. Tests and quizzes are OK, he is a very harsh grader. Does not seem to enjoy teaching, aside from making undergrads miserable. Avoid if you cannot learn the material from a textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	1	67417	4/27/08	KEEP IN MIND THAT I ONLY WENT TO 1 CLASS. I immediately dropped DA I exclusively because of the teacher. I was a notetaker for his class and he kept asking me questions and then making jokes about how I couldn't answer them when I was on a 5 second lag from trying to write down what he had last said. Dislikes athletes and COLA students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics	101	2	2	1	4	67417	10/12/06	Very soft spoken and can be hard to understand. Makes bad jokes that only he thinks are funny, which tend to be a bit on the **** side. Stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	4	67417	11/20/05	You guys are all babies. This is quite possibly the easiest math/stat professor there is. Not to mention Data Analysis and Engineering Statistics are elementary courses

Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	67417	2/27/05	Horrible teacher. I read the commends on this review and decided to take him, worst mistake I've ever made. I can't belive how many times I studied for a quiz, only to find out that NOTHING he taught for the past week was on it and stuff from 2 weeks previously was the topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	4	67417	10/14/04	He is not PC, which is refreshing. very funny, and is willing to help the students. He may seem mean, but just throw the insults back at him. Great Guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	NULL	67417	3/9/03	Incredible professor, if you can get over his sense of humor. If you just throw it all back at him, you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	67417	3/6/09	Very poor teacher. expects you to use mini-tab but does not teach you how. follows the book but doesn't explain anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics	328	4	2	2	4	67417	11/10/08	Old guy, talks pretty much to himself, so sit in the front. His humor is funny if you're open-minded.Easy course overall. DON'T ASK HIM QUESTIONS in class. he will redo the whole probelm for 1/2hour (zzzz). Id recommend him if you a little independent and easygoing. I dint even try for this class and go a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	2	67417	9/29/08	I have one word for this class: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I have had more sleep in this class then i have had in my bed. We should record his voice and sell it to insomniacs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	4	67417	5/4/07	Plays favorites in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67417	9/26/06	This professor was the reason I decided to drop the course. Picked on long-haired male about his looks during class (derogatorily, not jokingly). Know-it-all & closed-minded. Uses overhead projector that is very dark on at least 2 sides, and he doesn't write clearly at ALL, so good luck with note taking. You'll regret taking courses with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67417	10/17/05	I pretty much can't stand going to this class. I dislike his sense of humor and I dislike how he grades even more. He could care less about you as a student. Your grade is based on quizzes and tests so the homework you do doesn't count and even if you do it, his tests are so hard that it doesn't matter!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harry Schey	2.3	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	67417	5/2/05	Talks very quietly, sit in front or you won't be able to hear him. Decent teacher, wierd sense of humor. Easy tests, but his quizzes suck. He isn't the best at explaining concepts, and isn't very helpful after class, but does a good job presenting material the first time. Avoid if not independent.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	563918	7/12/06	Great Professor makes you work a lot but you will see results. Very understanding as well if you need extra time just dont feed him a line of crap and you be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	3	4	563918	2/9/06	nice guy, helps you whenever you need it. May not be so clear in class, but out of class he's great. Easy but no easy class. There is a lot of work, then there isn't. It really depends on what week it is. Overall, take him and do your work and you'll get a A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		3	1	1	3	563918	9/2/05	very very nice guy. very very bad teacher. I really didnt learn much from him and i never knew what was going on or what was expected. very inconsistant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	1	1	563918	1/31/05	Hes a good teacher but he doesnt stay on the point, or explain what we need to know and let us focus on the lab. He lectures way too much and confuses us all the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	563918	2/12/06	cool teacher.. helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	2	Graphic Arts		4	5	4	3	563918	10/2/05	Great teacher, not always 100% clear, but always willing to help. Also a funny guy and very energetic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	1	Graphic Arts		4	4	1	5	563918	3/3/05	Let's get to the point... his disorganization will be the death of him - and you. He's a great guy and it good at helping students individually, but in class lectures are confusing and irrelevant. The class isn't hard - you just need to ask him to clarify most of his assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Millard Schisler	3.2	1	Graphic Arts		3	4	2	4	563918	1/31/05	He's a nice guy, but very repetitive on information he teaches us. He's very unclear with directions he gives for labs, but if you ask him to elaborate he'll gladly help you more
Rochester Institute of Technology	Monique Schmidt	4.5	2	English		4	5	4	3	738829	10/27/05	Very nice person and the class isn't too bad if you don't mind writing and reading a little bit. Definately not the most painful english course i've ever taken. I would definately recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathryn Schmitz	5.0	2	English	883	5	5	5	5	640832	7/11/09	i love this teacher, her class was very easy and she helped me to improve how to write a good structured essays. You definitely need someone like this all over the RIT u will learn a lot and laugh too !
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathryn Schmitz	5.0	2	English		4	5	5	4	640832	7/17/05	She is quite strict teacher but she also can be cool too!! She have a good communication skills. She can improve anyone's grammar so well.. You will love her activity. If you prefer to do homework via computer, then this teacher is right for you. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathryn Schmitz	5.0	2	English	111	4	5	5	5	640832	5/13/08	She is an magnificent teacher who made us laugh and taught us how to write better. A good teacher who gave us advices and a good grader. I recommend you take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ryan Schneider	5.0	2	Engineering	361	4	5	5	5	1487825	1/24/11	he's a pretty cool guy... doesnt afraid of anything. SE361 is a lot of work period and the exams are fairly textbook heavy regardless of professor. Dedicate and spend an ample amount of time on the project and go to the SSE reviews and you'll be fine. He is very understanding if you talk to him and is a fair grader, lots of partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel Schreiner	4.5	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	1377783	11/22/11	He's the God in Computer Science. Extremely difficult. Weekly HWs are equivalent to any intense project. If you're taking him, don't take any other course. BUT, you will learn a lot. He teaches things that you won't learn elsewhere. I guess it's comparable to a Navy Seal training - you'll go through hell, but at the end of it, you'll get tough!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel Schreiner	4.5	2	Computer Science		1	4	4	5	1377783	5/26/10	You will not be able to take his class without having interest in the material; there is only 1 exam (final) and it is HARD. Expects you to do ALOT of work (weekly project-sized homeworks). Take his classes if you want to learn something and/or if you have easy classes besides his. C#.NET/DesignPatterns
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	0	Philosophy		2	3	1	4	737313	5/19/12	I had him for contemporary philosophy, and he teaches the course entirely from the continental perspective. He knows his stuff, but he isn't the best at presenting it to people who don't already know everything he's talking about already. If you are not an expert in continental philosophy, you'll have a hard time following him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	0	Philosophy		2	1	2	4	737313	4/6/10	Very arrogant. Doesn't like those who disagree. Thinks he's the only one who can think. Rambles on and on. My recommendation is to avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy	450	2	5	4	5	737313	9/18/09	A wonderful professor who is genuinely passionate about teaching; he is always available for additional support outside of class. He has a great depth of knowledge and enjoys class discussions & student participation. He grades fairly and expects students to work hard. Each class is intense in lecture & information. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	4	737313	1/9/07	He is an absolutely awesome and inspiring profesor. I've had lots of philosophy courses and Schroeder's are always the most interesting and challenging. He is definitely demanding so don't take him if you are looking for an easy class but if you want a class that will regularly blow your mind then take him. He's also very cool and grades fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	4	3	1	737313	4/23/06	talked at class too much, not interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	1	Philosophy		3	2	4	5	737313	2/7/06	Not too easy. Knows his stuff. Just attend the classes and you will understand most of the stuff. Tests are tough and the assignment submission has to be on time. Moderately recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		2	3	4	1	737313	10/26/05	He's really hard! Yeah he eplains but it gets so boring all you do is sleep! And he gets mad if you sleep and his tests are mad hard!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	5	737313	4/24/05	He's a good teacher. He tends to ramble a bit during his lectures, but he has a good knowledge of Eastern Phil. He's also very interested in helping people outside of class and that is not just limited to class related work. He's lead sevearl meditation sittings as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	1	Philosophy	460	2	3	3	3	737313	11/14/10	Teaches an interesting subject and is passionate. Loves to hear himself talk. Promotes class interaction, but rarely gives the students time to drive it. Acts hoitey toitey about things. Replies to questions for clarification with addresses to the class, obviously talking down to people but not singling them out, disguised as being Buddhist.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		3	5	2	5	737313	3/5/10	Very passionate; Explanations sometimes unclear though, and he tends to ramble sometimes. He definitely knows what he's doing though, and if you do the work you'll get the grade you deserve. Tests can be a bit tricky.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	0	Philosophy	449	2	1	1	3	737313	1/30/09	He likes to hear himself talk. Nothing will let him end a class early or even give a simple answer. He will not give you a definition, yet he will ask for definitions on tests "You should be able to figure it out yourself." All in all, he is boring as watching paint dry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	737313	11/20/06	Fairly easy class. Do homework(mostly essays) and study a little before tests and unless you have learning problems or something similar you can easily have an A. Also hes a nice guy, hell be helpful most of times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		2	4	4	2	737313	2/16/06	Hard teacher, if you are not into the subject I don't really suggest it. I had a little interest in the class due to the Matrix movies and that helped alot. He's an awesome guy to teach the subject and I will completly say to take him if you are interested and need the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Schroeder	3.6	2	Philosophy		2	4	5	5	737313	8/30/05	Best teacher I've had. Pastor/Historian/Philosopher combination made his lectures deep and informative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John(tod) Schueckler	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering		3	4	4	4	1692465	5/1/12	Somewhat confusing during lecture but very understanding and helpful. Labs are great balance of work and experience, but not entirely helpful with in class assignments. Overall good teacher, just requires a bit of extra work on student's part to keep up with fast paced class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John(tod) Schueckler	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	216	3	4	3	5	1692465	2/7/12	He's very nice and easy going. Doesn't mind pushing homework to the next week as long as you just ask. Makes a lot of mistakes on the whiteboard. Will be confusing if you don't pay attention otherwise you can easily correct him. Not a bad professor. exams are a little difficult, just have to study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	222	1	5	4	1	1043051	2/28/12	Schwartz is my favorite professor bar-none. He is very challenging, but he rewards hard work and makes you want to succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	1	Information Technology	417	1	3	2	4	1043051	5/13/11	Schwartz tends to cover material very quickly. He often moves onto advanced topics before the class has mastered the basics, resulting in students getting lost along the way. I would recommend not taking him. There are better programming teachers out there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	201	4	5	3	5	1043051	10/21/10	Had Professor Schwartz for Freshman Seminar for Game Design. Very involved with the industry and posts a lot of co-op info. You can tell he loves what he does. Didn't always stick to the curriculum, but Freshman Seminars let you skip around. Gave a lot of college and studying tips. Definitely a little off the wall, but you get used to it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology		2	5	2	4	1043051	1/26/10	The weakest professor I've had so far at RIT. While he clearly knows the curriculum, the entire course was so poorly organized that I had trouble keeping up. He graded practically nothing until week 7. However, to his credit, he was available outside of class and was both helpful and kind. I just wish his lectures were more focused and relevant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology		2	5	4	5	1043051	10/2/09	Amazing professor. Extremely funny. He moves really quick, so be prepared and be smart. Extremely fun in class, goes far beyond the required material. Has great game industry connections. Take his class now!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	330	3	5	4	5	1043051	3/2/08	His nerdy exuberance behooves me to attend lectures. One of the few morning classes I actually looked forward to. The tests are fairly easy, but he's certainly a tough grader on projects. Always willing to help, and a good professor overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	222	2	5	5	5	1043051	2/23/12	Amazing teacher. Very hard, but you will learn a lot, especially if you stick with it. Especially when taking classes with him earlier in your career, even if you end up withdrawing from the class, he will let you continue to attend, do it! Take Schwartz if you want to learn a lot and if you want a challenge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	5	1043051	4/13/11	While Schwartz is a kind person, he is an absolutely atrocious professor. His lectures have little to no focus. He goes on long winded tangents about his days at Cornell, instead of actually teaching. To be fair, however, he is helpful outside of class and is concerned with student success.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology		2	4	3	3	1043051	3/1/10	Really knows his stuff. Slightly insane and has a tendency to go off on tagents, but will help you out if you ask. Tests are much harder than any of the other homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	221	2	5	4	5	1043051	12/9/09	He's incredibly helpful, and goes out of his way to make sure students have a thorough understanding of the topic (including touching on some stuff outside the curriculum). If you're a strong student, he'll challenge you :) If you just want an easy A, find a different professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	1043051	7/9/08	Had him for 217/218 and 330. He's extremely friendly and likes to get to know his students if he can. ALWAYS available for help outside of class. He's very eccentric, you would have to have him to understand :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Schwartz	4.0	2	Information Technology	217	4	5	4	4	1043051	10/24/07	Scwartz is the man. He is a great professor. he is incredibly excited about teaching and makes every class interesting. Occasionally goes off on tangents or out of order but covers the material. He is willing to work with student at any time his office hours are great and its recommended that you attend them if you are confused. Terrific professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Scott	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1054316	1/24/12	Very sweet lady. Always willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Scott	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1054316	2/14/11	Easy professor, very understanding. If you have issues with your pathways project, she makes a lot of helpful suggestions and can basically GIVE you your project if all else fails. Fair grader. Makes pathways semi-not-boring, which is an achievement in and of itself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Scott	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	3	5	2	1054316	11/13/07	The nature of the FYE class itself is that of a third-grade environment, so I'm not surprised that Scott herself treats it as thus. She's a really nice lady, though, so when it comes to FYE, she's good. When it comes to the class, the class sucks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Scott	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1054316	5/20/11	Basically, the first commenter sums it all up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Debbie Scott	4.6	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	3	5	2	1054316	12/4/10	Super easy class, do the short assignments and you get an A. Scott is nice and gives bonus points if you earn them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	1	Information Technology		5	3	3	4	972291	3/16/13	He is easy but I sure did not learn much from him which I did not enjoy. He's too laid back. Consider your education when you select him. Easy A but will you learn anything? I learned solely by myself doing research online. Recommend him if you don't care. Find another prof if you're serious in human computer interactions...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	426	5	5	5	3	972291	2/17/12	This professor is great. He says the most off the wall funny things and keeps the class interested. Every assignment is easy and he is relaxed with deadlines. He is also a really nice guy, if you ever need help, he will go out of his way to make sure you succeed. Great professor, highly recommend taking him for HCI 1 and 2!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	2	972291	2/2/11	This professor is the best hands down. HCI was boring until he taught it. You will learn alot and have fun doing it. If you take HCI 1, HCI 2, or needs assement take this guy. You will not regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	972291	3/1/10	Professor Scott is the greatest professor on earth. He is very helpful in and outside of class, and understands the stress of student life more than any other professor I've had at RIT. If you have the opportunity to take a class with him, do it you will not be disappointed
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	460	5	5	5	1	972291	2/8/10	As requested... This professor is like super HOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	972291	9/14/09	Funny, laid back professor. Would highly recommend since he's really personable with students and realizes you probably don't care too much about HCI.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	425	5	5	5	5	972291	12/3/07	He's awesome! I didn't have to attend class all of the time! But I did my homework and ace'd! Take HIM!!!! He's cool, funny, and AWESOME!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	425	5	5	5	4	972291	4/27/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	1	Information Technology	425	5	5	1	1	972291	4/3/07	Great professor. Can get off track sometimes, but the class is very fun and he tries his best to make it interesting. (Given it's a really dry and boring subject to start with) Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you want an A show up. Very low stress, low workload class. If you can, take a class with him. Just don't abuse his generosity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	972291	11/14/12	Very laid back professor. Fair, very fair grader on assignments. Makes you present multiple times throughout the quarter and take tedious time consuming researching look up info quizzes every week. Fun professor. Recommended for HCI1.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	425	5	5	5	5	972291	9/6/11	He's an awesome teacher. He makes his classes fun and interactive. There is a real relax atmosphere in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	5	972291	7/5/10	Ethics in IT, awesome class, piece of cake, but you learn it. One of the best classes I have ever taken at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	460	5	5	5	5	972291	2/16/10	he is personable and really take the time to help students and offer great ideas on how to improve on projects. Grading is fair if you come to class and do the work. Not to mention he is super HOT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	972291	1/20/10	People that were in my class will understand these 2 words: Doomsday TACO.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	425	5	5	5	1	972291	10/31/08	One of a kind, laided back and takes alot of pressure off of his students. Nothing is every late. He is a very fair grader. If you show up and do the work you should expect to get an A no problem. Rick makes the material interesting. If you need an Easy A take this class..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	1	972291	10/18/07	Take this teacher if you need this class. He makes it the easiest class in the world for you while still caring about his students. Material is boring and dry, but he makes it fun. Very fair grader and very down to earth.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Scott	4.7	2	Information Technology	425	5	5	4	2	972291	4/12/07	I love this professor! He's so laid back, I never feel stressed coming to class. He makes the dry material seem more interesting, and the tangents in class always make things fun. Take him if you can, you won't regret it. Plus, he's a big electronica fan, big plus for me. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	1	Fine Arts		4	3	2	2	353888	10/4/12	While a nice man and decent teacher, I personally couldn't keep up due to lack of explanation. His assignments aren't clear, I don't think he knows what he's asking for until a lucky student accidentally stumbles upon it. This problem with this class is a clarity issue. As a person, he is funny and super nice, willing to talk, he does his best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts		3	1	3	3	353888	11/15/11	To simply put it, he's an idiot. Nice, sometimes, but overall an idiot. Just avoid his class if you can. I usually never write reviews because I don't find them necessary, there's no reason to explain myself because it'll take too long. The fact of the matter is that some will like him and some won't. If you're someone with amazing crafting technique you're going to waste your time no matter what. Find someone who's more challenging for you. Read a book & forget about Form class altogether.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts		3	5	4	4	353888	4/19/11	Great teacher. If you are cut out for design you will understand his assignments clearly. If you are lazy then don't take his class because you wont appreciate him like the people do who want to learn and progress. I have learned tons from his in the two quarters that I had him. Teaches design like it should be taught. Great 3D teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	1	Fine Arts		1	3	2	3	353888	6/30/10	not an easy grader. wants perfection. wants things to be completely off the deep end. unclear. has favorites. enjoyable guy. projects very structured- don't give much leeway. you don't do what he wants you dont get a good grade. Craft important- u paint everything you make. take carson or bell. u'll learn more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	3	353888	10/25/09	Scully is an enthusiastic professor who is dedicated to his class. Tends to pick some favorites, but generally fair to all. By the end, you will be sick of trash and mechanical fasteners.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts	101	2	3	4	2	353888	7/16/08	Scully is tough and at first, as a freshman, he will drive you nuts. But hang on, he gets better with time, and if you go to class consistently (and I mean always) and try hard, he warms up and he's one of the best 3D profs. *get him in convos about green conservation or older punk cartoons- he was a wild teenager once!*
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts		4	5	5	5	353888	4/20/08	Best professor any 1st yr will have, ever. Well in 3D any way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts	101	3	5	5	3	353888	10/17/07	Great guy. His lack of clarity is meant to provide room for creativity. There are no clear cut answers in art, I can't believe that other students didn't appriciate that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts		3	2	2	2	353888	5/1/06	scully is a nice guy but doesnt explain what he wants. i dont think his criteques are fair. he gets better as the class goes on. but he is a little biased when grading. unfair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts		5	3	1	NULL	353888	7/2/04	Nice guy, however he can't explain anything that he wants. The critiques are a joke in that class because you don't get any useful information fedback to you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	1	Fine Arts		2	3	2	3	353888	11/17/11	People who hate him don't get design form & are bitter because,unlike most teachers he will give out Cs and Ds to those who deserve them.You can resubmit after crit.People think the class is a waste but the basics being taught are useful. People that think they are already too good for him & the class in their 2nd year need to get over themselves.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	4	353888	10/11/11	Amos has issues with students if they can't and don't read his mind. What he finds attractive in form is not what everyone likes but if it isn't his way then you won't get a good grade. Very limited teacher, he is best to AVOID AT ALL COSTS. He shouldn't be working at RIT. He gives teachers there a bad name with his lazy attitude.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	353888	2/10/11	Excellent tacher. I have learned more from him in 2 quarters than I thought imaginable. He really gets to the heart of design. He is a great professor. I would recommend to anybody who loves design and actually wants to learn. Not too much homework. A well balanced foundation course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	1	Fine Arts		3	2	3	3	353888	12/1/09	He is a really fun, nice teacher. Sometimes he gives very difficult assignments with not enough time to do them, but he is pretty lenient about redoing projects, and he is an easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts		1	2	1	1	353888	11/20/08	He's a nice guy just not too great of a teacher. He is too vague with his assignments and although he may try to explain it to you it just doesn't ever come across clearly as to what he wants. He's an unfair grader and will judge you the entire semester on how he perceives you after the 1st project. If you have an option don't take him as a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	0	Fine Arts	101	5	1	2	1	353888	4/22/08	I didn't like Scully. His assignments were vague and I had difficulty first knowing what he expected, and second providing it. He was an alright guy, just... if you don't know how to make a line have feelings, DON'T take his class. That's what did me in. I was unaware lines had emotions. :/ He was kinda skeletal, BTW, Hot if you like dysplasia.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts	101	5	5	5	5	353888	10/17/07	Great. Great. Great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	1	Fine Arts	101	2	3	3	3	353888	4/27/07	awesome professor! wants you to do well while pursuing topics that interest you. his class requires a lot of effort and it gets easier to understand what he wants as time goes by.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Amos Scully	3.0	2	Fine Arts		1	5	2	NULL	353888	2/16/04	Scully is an awesome guy, but the class is insanely hard to figure out. You rarely know what you're doing, and even though he's willing to help you, he's so abstract, it almost doesn't matter :P
Rochester Institute of Technology	J.Matt Searls	1.0	0	Literature		2	1	1	3	1687956	4/5/13	If you are up to do abstracts every week, be my guest! He doesn't give out fair grades as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	1	480307	11/27/12	Good sense of humor. Willing to work with students. Very helpful. Easy quizzes. No textbook- everything is posted online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	480307	11/27/11	Excellent professor, great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	480307	10/19/11	Incredibly helpful and knowledgeable on topics. Constructs a class which is meant to broaden your horizons and introduces you to new perspectives. An incredible teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	480307	11/11/10	Amazing prof. One of the best at RIT. Explains things well without adding his own opinion. Wants you to do well. Easy A. Weekly quizzes are only on what he talked about in the previous class. Reading is not needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	325	4	5	5	3	480307	2/25/09	Real cool, down to earth guy- always gets you thinking. I actually enjoyed his lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	325	4	5	5	2	480307	11/26/08	Professor Selinger is amazing. He took some dense articles on the philosophy of design and made them crystal clear. If I have a chance to take another one of his classes, I would do it in an instant.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	480307	3/12/08	Selinger is an amazing teacher! His class is the best I've taken so far at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	5	5	5	4	480307	6/16/07	By far, the best professor I've ever had at RIT. He explains everything very clearly, and pauses often to make sure that the class is following. He offers numerous opportunities for extra credit, and his tests are fairly easy if you attend the lectures. He's inspired me to take a minor in Philosophy. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	4	480307	2/2/07	Awesome teacher. If you have to take a Philosophy class, take it with him. Selinger has great stories, explains everything very clearly, takes the time to answer every question thoroughly no matter how stupid it is, and is extremely patient. He really seems to care about every student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	5	5	5	3	480307	9/2/06	Though he comes off as semi-stuck up, he's really very approachable. Had an 8am class and I was able to stay awake for each one. Wish I could have him again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	3	480307	11/21/12	While I was dragging myself out of bed for other classes, I looked forward to Selinger's lectures because they were so interesting and he taught with such enthusiasm. I was hoping to take his Philosophy of Technology class but it was full. Very good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	480307	10/24/11	Best professor at RIT. Hands down!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	4	480307	5/30/11	Selinger is one of the best prof at RIT. Period. He is helpful, smart, and genuinely wants his students to do well. You really have to try to get a bad grade, if you do, well then maybe you shouldn't be in college. TAKE HIM!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	1	480307	5/14/09	Great professor, easily my favorite so far. Extremely clear in lecture, and he clearly loves what he does. Also, the quizzes and tests are extremely easy, as is the 1 paper required. Take this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	449	2	5	4	4	480307	2/18/09	Incredible lectures. Teaching skills are amazing - never bored whilst he's speaking. Always makes time to help with any topic; definitely cares that students learn and understand material. Awesome guy in general- has great personal anecdotes to keep lectures interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	480307	3/19/08	This guy is the man. I'm not very fond of professors but he's just good at what he does.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	480307	2/21/08	Best professor/teacher I've ever had. Amazing at explaining concepts and getting you interested. Funny guy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	480307	5/31/07	Great teacher! Take any class he offers as he really knows his stuff and explains it very clearly. I can't ask how many times he honestly asked "Does everyone understand?" Great teacher. A+++++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy	472	4	5	4	5	480307	1/30/07	Evan is a good Professor, he encourages students to participate and debates actively with students in a non-threatening way. He is a fair-to-easy grader, and is very approachable. A pleasure to take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	3	5	3	480307	5/12/06	Very organized class. Is a fair grader, and has interesting lectures. A great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	3	480307	5/3/06	Very good professor. Interesting lectures, easy quizes, fair grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	5	5	480307	10/19/05	Pretty good teacher and very interesting class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	1	480307	4/28/05	Good teacher, interesting to listen to. Expects his students to do the work and know their information though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	480307	3/20/05	Absolutely phenomenal. The class was tad easy, but Selinger kept it interesting. Extremely articulate without being condescending. We had fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	480307	11/5/04	Amazing teacher, I actually looked forward to his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	4	4	3	480307	12/14/05	AMAZING! I loved his class so much. He was very easy to understand and as long as you read you did well in the class. He is a fair grader and very interesting. There is never a boring moment in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	3	480307	10/11/05	Interesting lectures. Grade composed of three tests with questions directly out of the notes, and two papers, one based on the reading and one based on a guest lecture. Both papers were graded on the basis of effort. Very easy class, interesting lectures. Energetic, knowledgable, and reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	4	3	480307	4/6/05	Good teacher, I just could not get into the abstraction he was shooting for. He says his class is real easy, but make sure you can write well or you will suffer. He is always open to questions and answers them swiftly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Evan Selinger	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	480307	12/15/04	Articulite enough to make engineers understand philosophy esaly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ethan Senecal	5.0	2	Physical Education	101	5	5	5	3	1534841	1/26/11	Had him for Beginners Volleyball. Great guy, great "professor" (coach). Not only was his class so much fun and a highlight of my week, but you also learned a lot, and saw great improvement in the first few weeks of class. Had a blast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	1	Physics	212	2	2	3	4	1409633	9/7/10	Sever is terrible. Students knew more than him. He lectures the book exactly. gives bad explanations. Not helpful in lab. Often makes mistakes and doesn't explain how he solves problems. Makes jokes about drinking alcohol. Find another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	2	Physics	212	1	4	3	2	1409633	5/11/10	I had him for Physics 2. The lecture is boring.I usually leave. The labs are mandatory though. SOme of them are fun. He's a very hard test grader. But he's also very helpful. I see that most people on here are not a fan of his,but I liked him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1409633	4/19/10	Horrible professor. Makes bad jokes, not helpful at all, reads notes word for word. Can't explain his own mistakes. Does not help in lab, and lectures are boring and everybody falls asleep. try to avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	1	3	1409633	3/5/10	Terrible teacher. It was his first quarter teaching, and it showed. He followed the same curriculum and gave the same tests as the other physics professor, but gave different notes. So we were not prepared for the tests as he didn't even know what was on the tests. The lab TA and the physics tutors helped me get through the class. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	1	5	1409633	2/24/10	Yeah. Straight to the point: he sucks. He doesn't do anything in the lab. Not helpful whatsoever. Tries to makes jokes in class and fail. Not generous. Any other bad qualities: u name it, he got it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	2	3	1409633	7/11/10	Class was lectured entirely from the book, word for word, example for example. Tests were made by another prof in the dept. who did not use the book and therefore was not testing on our material. Not a bad person, just a bad teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics	212	3	1	2	3	1409633	4/28/10	All notes given are photocopies from the textbook, and all exple problems are from the book. Rarely are these actually helpful with the MP and WS assignments, nor is it helpful with exams. The class isn't difficult if you already have some understanding of the material otherwise it's quite difficult. (class average: week 9: 60%)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1409633	4/14/10	Awful teacher. Makes jokes in lecture that no one laughs at. Can't relay information in a meaningful manner. Class average on the first test was a 60. That alone should speak for itself about how well he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Byron Sever	1.6	0	Physics		1	1	2	2	1409633	2/25/10	Worst professor I've had. This was his first quarter teaching and it was terrible. He didn't actually "teach," his lectures came straight from the textbook, often word-for-word (60+ pages of notes...) I learned more from the TA in lab than from him because he stayed up front and drank coffee. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Shackelford	4.0	1	Literature		4	3	3	2	1187328	5/22/09	Nice person but lectures are dull. She does too much group work. Medium-grader. Not an easy A, but obtainable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Shackelford	4.0	2	Literature		4	5	4	3	1187328	10/27/08	She's really super nice and the class is fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Shackelford	4.0	2	Literature		3	4	4	2	1187328	2/25/09	Friendly, clear, and helpful- a good all-around professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Shackelford	4.0	2	Literature	482	3	4	5	4	1187328	10/16/08	An inviting and enjoyable professor. The class is fun and interesting, assuming you do the reading. She makes use of the library's resource sharing, so be prepared to print 80% of the reading assignments (or go to the printing place on campus). Be prepared to discuss the reading in class. 3 shorter Essays, and 1 long one at the end of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67418	2/19/13	Honestly hands-down the best math professor I've had. He gives quizzes every week but they're really easy. Although he has the reputation of giving a lot of homework, its worth it. His notes are clear and exams are straight forward. And he gives fruit to the people who score highest on the exam! I love this guy!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	67418	10/29/12	The material itself is relatively easy though there is a lot of hw. All of the homework, however, relates to the quizzes and tests. Can move quickly but will slow down to accommodate. As a teacher he is passionate and well learned. He does a phenomenal job conveying his knowledge onto students. One of the best teachers on campus.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics	768	3	5	5	4	67418	11/10/11	HE IS AMAZING ! Does give a lot of HW but is useful ! Def would take another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	3	67418	5/3/11	Hardest Prof. Moves way too fast, and actively tries to give bad grades. Class did well on a test? Next one needs to be 10x harder. This guy is psychotic. Stay away if you value your GPA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	4	67418	1/28/10	Homework load was a little on the crazy side with material covered Tuesday due Thursday. Definitely worth doing though. The tests/quizzes were simple if you kept up with the homework. Very methodical lectures. I'd definitely recommend him for a math class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics	325	2	5	4	4	67418	11/7/09	Shahmohamad is a great professor, he is quite intimidating at first though. He assigns a lot of long and hard homework, but it's necessary to understand the material. There is a quiz every week, two exams, and a final exam. They are all SIMPLE! Take Dr. Shahmohamad, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	67418	3/9/08	Great guy, always willing to help, very hard class but he does a lot of examples. lots of hw, but really helps. only problem was he was never in his office. but definitely take him if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67418	3/11/07	Great professor!!! Homework due every thurs... takes about two hours so if you space it out its not bad.... Tests are very easy if you do homework.. Mostly problems that he has talked about or from homework with different numbers... Great guy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67418	3/2/07	Great teacher. He is very clear when lecturing and problems on tests and quizzes are straight forward and very similar to homework problems. If you keep up with the homework you will do well in the class. Probably the best teacher I have had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67418	2/6/07	Greatest calc teacher ever. somehow made the lectures interesting and understandable. there is a lot of hw each week but he does some of it in class with you and it's never too hard. just keep up on the work and you'll get an A. also tests aren't too bad just tricky
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	67418	11/27/12	One of the better math teachers at RIT. Homework WILL help when it comes to quizzes. Do the hw before the quiz. Tests are hard but easier with lots of practice. Don't miss class because he occasionally will do problems very close to test questions. Very slight accent but nothing to be worried about.Overall very good teacher. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67418	2/14/12	A fantastic professor. His lectures are very easy to understand, and his sense of humor makes them more than bearable. Watch out for a lot of homework, but if you do it all, the weekly quizzes are a piece of cake
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	67418	10/24/11	He does not ask trick questions. He explains complicated things through very enlightening analogies. He assigns a lot of homework, but if you do it, you will understand the material. He wants you to understand Discrete Math, and, what's more, he wants you to pass his course. This guy knows what he's doing, and it shows.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics	366	4	5	5	4	67418	5/24/10	Easily one of the best professors/teachers I have ever had, if not the best. He is extremely reasonable and understanding. He gives a lot of homework, but it is worth doing it all. Quizzes and exams are straight forward if you do the homework and he never pulls any surprises. Overall, he is very inspiring and I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	2	67418	1/26/10	Good teacher. The subject is very difficult, but he does a good job. His class was a little homework heavy, but manageable. He does seem intimidating at first, but he's actually kind of cool and willing to talk to you about tests/homework if you have questions. Sometimes he went a bit too fast for me and I got confused during example problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics	366	4	5	5	3	67418	8/26/09	Best professor I have ever had. I learned an enormous amount of material in a short amount of time. Class consists of weekly homeworks, weekly quizzes, and three exams. Lots of work but it's necessary to fully understand the subjects. I wish Shahmohamad taught more classes I need to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	2	67418	2/22/08	Awesome!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67418	3/6/07	Best Professor at RIT. Lots of homework, but actually worth it. If you ever have a chance to take him, do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	67418	3/1/07	shahmohamad is the absolute best. he's a WONDERFUL teacher. you'll understand everything he teaches you, and if you dont, he's always willing to help you out one-on-one. and he's just a funny, cool guy. i recommend him to everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	1	Mathematics	366	2	3	2	1	67418	12/18/06	Don't ever take this professor. The homework load is unbelievable! For example, Week #6: Sec 9.3: #4,5,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,34-44; Sec 9.4: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,14,15,29,30,31; Sec 9.5: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,30,313,32-36; Sec 9.6: 2,3,4 (And most of these questions have sub questions a,b,c,d,e,f,... HAVE FUN!)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	67418	3/4/06	Great Prof learned an incredible amount without getting lost in the process, Lots of homework due every week and quizzes every week, but study and do your work and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	67418	12/5/05	An amazing professor. He makes Mathematics exciting. Be warned, you may want to change to a Math major after having Shahmohamad. The homework is very routine and organized, and don't listen to people complaining about the amount it's very doable with just a few hours set aside a week, even when you are taking 16-18 credits.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	2	67418	6/20/05	Very good teacher. Made difficult material seem easy as he approached sample problems as if he was a student seeing it for the first time. He has an accent but is easily understandable. Will give lots of homework but will "help" by doing some in class. Doing the homework pays off come test time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	5	67418	2/2/05	Excellent teacher all-around. Extremely intelligent, humorous, professional. HIGHLY reccommended. Tests are homework problems with different numbers, sometimes homework problems exactly. Class is highly structured and you always know where you stand. Strong, but understandable Iranian Accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	67418	10/21/04	Awesome teacher. He gives lots of homework, but it pays off doing it when you get to the tests. No suprises. Highly recomended.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	67418	11/17/05	Very proffesional teacher. Top notch. You're not guaranteed an "A", but his classes are very straight-forward and as interesting as math classes get.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	5	67418	9/4/05	Great Teacher.. he made it easy to understand. A TON of routine homework problems, but nothing too difficult for a math student, just tedious.. But forces you to learn. If you do the work you should have no problem recieving a great grade!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		1	3	4	3	67418	6/29/05	Good teacher or not, the homework load is crushing. Unless you're taking less than 12 credits or happen to like doing 75+ problems every week on top of your other course load, give him a miss. So he's a nice guy? So what. The massive overload gets old fast. To make it worse, his homework is weighted same as his tests, which aren't easy either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	3	67418	2/17/05	Okay teacher. He knows what he's teaching but is very hard on homework and tests as a result. Doesn't explain concepts very well though and his accent only makes it worse. Bonus helpfulness for letting me retake a test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hossein Shahmohamad	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	67418	10/22/04	Great teacher, he explains everything in class. A lot of work, but it pays off on the tests and quizes.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1187379	3/16/12	Almost impossible not to get an A. I did almost nothing and managed an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1187379	2/12/11	Pathways Service: Easy in-class projects. No homework, quizzes, or exams. Meet with her once to talk about life, and go to class = 100%. She is very very kind and caring, and she tries to make class fun. She is a very genuine person. Best professor for the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1187379	2/4/10	Amazingly helpful and super nice. Super nice with side of nice....oh...and google her...she's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	1187379	7/22/09	What a great person! Her class was the highlight of my week--I wished it was more often than 1 hour/week. She really cares about making your time at RIT what you want it to be. She connected me to a community service group and sends out personal emails to check up on you if you seem to need it. I'll be staying in contact with her for a long time!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1187379	2/17/09	She is such a nice and helpful person - I don't think I could have asked for a better FYE instructor. She just wants to help you with whatever you need and to make FYE as fun as possible. When you meet her, you immediately start to like her. If you have a choice for which FYE teacher you want, pick this one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	4	1187379	10/16/08	She is extremely nice and helpful. Once you first meet her, you feel very comfortable around her. If you ever need to talk to someone, she's the one - she wants to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1187379	5/10/11	Great person. Just attend her sessions, do the work get an A at the end. Fun & enjoyable

Rochester Institute of Technology	Colette Shaw	5.0	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	1187379	11/25/08	She is one of the greatest professors you can take at Rit! She is fun to work with, sweet, and she assigns hw to you that are easy to complete and also fun to do in the meanwhile!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	923217	9/27/11	Just a bad teacher in general. Not helpful and condescending.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	0	Engineering	342	4	1	1	2	923217	2/11/09	Has the teaching capacity of an untrained monkey. Does not go over the material AT ALL all he does is give VERY UNclear directions and say DO. If at all possible avoid him at all costs. You have been Warned.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	2	Engineering	336	4	5	5	5	923217	11/21/06	Great professor. Keeps you awake, teaches well and explains everything. Easy to ask questions, and overall if you do your homework carefully, tests arent that hard overall. A lot of homework so dont put it off till last night, you will be doing it till morning.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	0	Engineering	342	1	1	2	2	923217	2/24/09	this class was a nightmare. i have heard that he is good at higher level classes, but made Problem Solving with Computers one of the worst classes of my entire life. does not explain, does not effectively answer questions, really a very crappy teacher if i've ever had one. i hope i never have him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	2	Engineering	347	4	4	5	5	923217	2/27/08	Very good teacher. His teaching method is very effective. He makes the students solve problems very similar to those problems you will see on HW and tests. Of course, he explains the material and the formulas beforehand. Overall great teacher and person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Sciremammano	3.3	2	Engineering	336	5	5	5	5	923217	11/27/06	This dude knows his stuff and knows how to teach. I reccomend coming to class, where he WILL make you participate. He is the best Mechanical Engineering Prof here at RIT that I have had yet, and I will be in every class that he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	405	4	5	5	4	978216	2/27/13	Such a wonderful professor. Each class with him gets better and better. There is a lot of reading for his classes, so you will want to keep up with the assignments to understand the lecture material. He is always clear about what he wants and how he grades. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	4	978216	2/27/12	For Criminology: Incredibly good teacher. Easily conveys material, very helpful and easy to approach if you have questions. The pace of the class is just about right (not too much work, but enough to reinforce the lectures), and the exams aren't terribly difficult. Definitely take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	5	978216	11/2/11	Makes class very interesting even though he mostly lectures. You have to read the articles or you won't do as well on tests. However, highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	5	978216	3/9/11	Great professor, great sense of humor, and very understanding. Definitely take him if you can, highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	400	3	5	5	5	978216	3/5/10	Had a great time in Criminology. Only 4 grades for the course, so keep up and study for the exams. Highly reccomended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	4	3	978216	5/12/08	He is a very friendly and open teacher, with fairly straight forward assignments. The class is based off slides which can be very dry at times, but the videos are very entertaining. He gives you help for the midterm/final which are not too difficult, mostly short answers. Lastly a research paper with the topic of your choosing. Good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	4	978216	6/22/07	The class requires work, but its not extremely hard. If you put time and effort into the class, you're almost garuanteed an A. Prof. Scott is pretty chill too-pretty young and understanding when it comes to missing a class or 2. He let class out early when it was nice out! He's very knowledgable no his subjects<very appreciated.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	400	5	4	4	3	978216	3/13/12	I took Scoot for criminology, and he was great. Tells you straight up what he expects. Test are extremely fair as long as you do the readings which aren't that bad. Attendance is not mandatory, and I regret missing so many classes. I still got an A, but I would go to more classes if I started over. He's quite interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	4	4	2	978216	11/12/11	Very thorough and great information. I've never had a professor who got such good class discussion participation. Engages students and easily conveys content. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	443	3	5	5	5	978216	8/21/11	I have had Professor Scott for Criminology and Law Enforcement in Society. Both classes he has been great, I've learned so much. Highly recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	101	2	5	5	5	978216	11/29/10	VEry interesting professor. I really liked Intro to Criminology and recommend this professor to anyone who wishes to learn about it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	5	978216	12/18/09	Professor Scott is a really nice professor. He makes the class interesting and grades fairly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Scott	4.8	2	Criminal Justice	443	3	5	5	3	978216	4/9/08	Had Prof. Scott for several classes. He's very organized/no surprises and quickly responds to e-mail. Tests come mostly from lecture. If you do the work this is at least an easy B. Very fair and down to earth person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business		2	2	3	4	363069	8/16/12	Its clear even he is not interested in his own material... Skip the course unless you like busywork that yields and A + a few headaches
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		3	2	2	3	363069	11/17/11	ends class lecture early, every time. then you are supposed to work with your group on a project due week 10.im not the only one who thinks he is just being lazy. gave me a C although i never got anything below a B in the class because of attendance and peer evaluations. Even know his class is useless to go to in the first place,and i mean useless
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business	507	3	3	3	2	363069	5/17/11	Alright professor, requires attendance to class, but powerpoints that he covers have nothing to do with the content on exams. If you are not an out of the class room learner do not take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business	104	3	3	3	4	363069	11/17/10	Cool Guy, Funny, Endslecture early for group work which is cool. Read the text and Study and its not to bad, the class at MCC is alot easier than RIT, grades fairly easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business		3	5	3	1	363069	2/1/10	You either like the guy or you hate him. I like him. His lectures are extremely light and only glances over some key things. You NEED to know the vocabulary because thats the test. Gives PLENTY of time to work on group project. Excellent at responding to emails, extremely helpful. Class is alot of work but very manageable. Would recommend
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		2	1	2	2	363069	5/12/09	Acts like the class is easy but gives A LOT of work. Calls full class exams "quizzes". Very tough grader. Doesn't teach the material. Uses Wiki articles instead of textbooks. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business	104	4	4	4	2	363069	12/4/08	I took a section of his at MCC and he seems genuine. However, I felt he could be doing more for those of us who actually tried. I am an honors student and came here primarily for financial reasons and he talks to everyone like they're 2. Says hes willing to help but did nothing for me. Learned nothing except that working in groups is the worst.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		4	1	2	1	363069	1/28/08	Abuses power and very lazy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business	438	2	3	3	2	363069	1/13/08	Took business wthics with him. He's really strict and not the best professor in the world. When it comes to attendance, he can be a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business	102	3	5	4	4	363069	10/19/07	He isn't all that bad, yes attendance is mandatory. If you happen to miss a class and email him letting him know why, he's very understanding. I missed a quiz one day he didn't count me absent and I got to retake the quiz. He's a tough teacher but if you do what he askes its not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business		4	3	3	4	363069	3/9/12	Not a bad professor, weighs a lot on his tests vs projects. He reads directly from the slides and then tries to put a little spin on it when he can, sometimes he will tell you the subjects for the test in advance which is nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		2	3	1	4	363069	6/6/11	attendance is required. turn the mini paper and your team paper in early like he says, he will hold it against you if you don't. If he makes a mistake, he will not admit it which sucks when it comes to grades. he is a stickler for citations more so than content. tests have extremely specific content from the book, power points are worthless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business	104	3	3	3	4	363069	11/17/10	Cool Guy, Funny, Ends lecture early for group work which is cool. Read the text and Study and its not to bad, the class at MCC is alot easier than RIT, grades fairly easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business		3	3	3	1	363069	8/27/10	He's very good at responding to emails and posting grades but his tests have 2 parts, essay sect which are automatic points(he tells you the questions beforehand) and a multiple choice sect which can be very hard since many of the questions are from small details. He lecture for 30mins and dismisses everyone which can be good/bad depending on pref.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business	101	2	5	4	5	363069	7/3/09	Excellent teacher. You will need to study and do your homework, but he is a fun teacher and grades fairly. You will need to read the text book in order to pass his course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business		3	4	3	2	363069	1/12/09	VERY effortful professor. He teaches off the topic a lot though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business		5	5	4	5	363069	2/2/08	Great guy, always willing to help. Go to class,read the text, ask for help and there's your A; no sweat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		3	1	1	1	363069	1/14/08	A very lazy professor. Acted to be very ethical and strict but didn't teach anything at all. Taught class for only 30 minutes and asked to meet in groups.Bad professor and also a jerk. Swore in class and threatened to kill students who didn't do their homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	2	Business	507	3	5	4	4	363069	10/19/07	As long as you read the book and study the powerpoints you will do fine. He gives you his essay questions ahead of time and he takes the tests from the writers of the book. When writing papers, if you show it to him early enough he will help you so that you can get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business	507	2	2	4	3	363069	3/3/07	Attendance is mandatory. There is a quiz every week, read the book before and you should be fine. He makes the questions harder as the quarter goes. A lot of material to study for the tests. Study homework questions long before the test. One group paper, but it was easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	0	Business		2	2	1	5	363069	5/23/06	Unclear about academia. Changes a lot of things. Sets lower bounds 4 attendance, does't set upper bounds. Professor abuses powers given to him. Does not care how good you are in academia as long as you attend class. Makes u leave class only to Waste your time by making you come to class when he cannot provide computers for you to use.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business		3	3	3	2	363069	5/23/06	Strict teacher and is an ass about attendance. I had perfect attendance too and he was still bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Scrivens	3.0	1	Business		4	3	3	2	363069	10/13/04	Easy teacher!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		4	4	3	4	163575	4/28/09	I had him for Organizational Behavior. The grade was comprised of three essays, and 5 tests. The tests were difficult, but were doable if you studied beforehand- the study guides are good. He grades the essays very conservatively, rarely giving a grade over a 90%. However, I learned a lot from him, and since thats really the goal, he was good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		3	4	4	4	163575	10/22/07	He is a fun teacher and is very interactive with the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		4	5	5	5	163575	11/11/06	Very knowledgable in his field. Very motivating. Great lessons. Youll do well in the class as long as you work with your group members and study. Overall a very enjoyable teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		4	4	4	4	163575	10/21/06	Gives out notes, study those and you'll be fine. good teacher.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	0	Business	325	3	2	2	2	163575	11/25/08	Worst teacher I've ever had. Extremely rude, offensive, and controversial. Openly admitted to being a **** pig several times. The material was not hard but he did not take much time to teach it to you. Mostly told personal stories that obviously you aren't going to be tested on. Book he used was very interesting though. Willing to help at least.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	1	Business	250	5	1	5	1	163575	11/21/06	He is funny and keeps it interesting, however he is a jerk. Hard to talk to or ask questions. He is VERY rude and thinks his class is super tough when its easiest Ive ever taken. Gives out stupid extra credit points for like lamest things... whatever... if u like the subject of business ull enjoy it, i figured it wasnt for me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		4	5	5	5	163575	10/29/06	Very funny guy, he seems like a great guy.. the great thing about him too is that you will have a hard time sleeping in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business	767	2	4	4	5	163575	9/27/06	bloody joker!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	2	Business		2	3	5	5	163575	8/30/05	Awesome professor. Made fun of me and the fellow printers in the class everday. Made the class enjoyable. You have to be able to take a joke.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Scully	3.8	1	Business	101	4	3	3	NULL	163575	10/29/03	Good choice for an easy class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Matt Searls	1.0	0	Literature	101	1	1	1	1	1687957	1/23/12	Any deaf studies course under him, he is the worst professor. I couldn't able understand him at all. Entire of the course, he repeatedly showing off his PHD degree in deaf studies.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Semeraro	2.7	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	389264	9/21/05	Highly reccomended - his tests may be difficult, but he scales the grades. One of the better CE professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Semeraro	2.7	1	Engineering		2	3	3	NULL	389264	4/19/04	His exams are rough but he is very helpful if you ask the "right" questions. He is nice and his lectures are pretty good. He's an ok guy. And no project for Comp Org :) Don't email him cuz he's useless with email.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Semeraro	2.7	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	389264	8/12/05	Worst professor I've ever had. He assumed everyone knew half the material in the beginning of class; those who didn't had no clue what he was building on. He never explained anything well enough, and if you tried to ask questions you usually got laughed at or some sarcastic comment directed toward you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		3	4	3	4	146938	11/7/12	Lots of reading assignments that are very long. Takes quiz and test questions from class discussion so very important to attend class. You will definitely walk away from his class having learned something...but this guy is very "psychedelic" and sometimes you may have no idea what tangent he is on. Very insightful and funny at times. No textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	1	Sociology	101	3	3	2	1	146938	4/27/11	Not sure if it was the 4 hour class, the subject, the teacher or the combination of both but I absolutely hated this class. It was 4 hours of extremely boring lecture/discussion. Very little work in the class, 2 quizzes and 2 tests. Assigned readings weekly which were then discussed in class. I'd stay away if possible, very very boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	0	Sociology	101	4	2	2	1	146938	10/21/10	So boring. Lecture is useless, goes off on tangents often. Tests based on readings. Textbook and library reserves. Easy to pass if you do the readings, which are fairly easy to understand. Prof thinks sociology is the answer to life, disregards other opinions as completely irrational.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	0	Sociology	210	2	1	2	2	146938	2/2/09	The worst teacher I have ever seen. He hates life, hates the class, tries to push everyone to go to Croatia. This guy is creepy. I absolutely hate sociology more than anything because of his class. Worst experience here at RIT. He would come in to class and complain about life, then give a boring lecture that had no deep insight at all. Awful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		3	3	4	1	146938	11/12/08	Good Professor, not excellent though. He requires a substantial amount of effort for a liberal arts course, and requires (and draws from) many "reserved" articles which can only be found (unfortunately) in the library. my advice to anyone taking this prof. is to DO THE READINGS, you probably won't get above a C if you don't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		4	5	5	3	146938	10/16/08	Class was good so long as people were willing to participate in class, if not then class got a bit boring. It was a great class, I was prepared for a dry lecture class but was pleasently surprised. If you have to take the class make sure that you take it with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	1	Sociology		5	3	2	3	146938	7/26/07	Plus side...no text book. Downside, class is entirely based upon discussion, even the lecture is spawned by it, so if the class itself is terrible and unresponsive, they class is going to be tedious. However, one on one Prof is pretty good and he does know his stuff
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		5	5	5	4	146938	1/7/07	I loved his class of Sociology he makes everything so interesting and fun. Its a pretty easy class, all you have to do is read and give your opinion in class. Quizes are pretty easy also
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	0	Sociology		4	3	1	1	146938	5/21/06	Talks about himself to great length in all lectures. Take him if you want to learn about the sociology of professors becoming professors from lower class families.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		3	5	5	5	146938	9/29/05	One of my top three favorite professors of my college career.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	1	Sociology	101	4	2	4	3	146938	10/25/11	A good liberal arts class to take if you need to fill a requirement, can be boring but if you go to class and do the readings (30 pages at most) you'll get at least a B. Tests are mostly from the reading and knowing the vocab is important. E-mail him within the first few weeks of class b/c he is not very open in person, but likes E-mail
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology	210	3	4	4	2	146938	11/18/10	May tangent in lectures, but often the tangents are quite fun. Has been exceedingly helpful and willing to help outside of class. Very nice to interact with one on one and understands if you have had a stressful day in class. I fell asleep because I had made up a test just before his class and he just let me sleep. He likes you if you show interest
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		2	4	4	2	146938	3/22/10	I have had this professor for 3 quarters now and I would not have been able to survive that much sociology if I did not have him as a teacher. Is enthusiastic about the class and can stimulate a conversation/debate out of people who normally wouldn't participate. Awesome professor, I have one more class with him to finish my concentration :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology	101	4	3	4	3	146938	11/18/08	Decent teacher. He can make class pretty interesting, but I had a difficult time focusing after the first hour. Anyways, the tests are easy as are the few quizzes.It is required that you do the readings for this course though...he draws a lot from them and they're all on the library reserve system online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		2	4	4	3	146938	11/3/08	Quirky, smart, and entertaining even if the material is dry and blah. Significant effort is required, but if you keep up you'll be fine. Class requires lots of reading, both from the text ($100) and from library-reserved articles. Keep that in mind if you're not library-prone. Definitely a good professor - highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		3	5	4	4	146938	10/19/07	awesome professor!i failed a test, found out why and aced the final. super helpful and is willing to sit down and explain concepts as well as assignments in great detail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		3	5	4	4	146938	4/11/07	Vincent's test questions can be a little tricky (and highly frustrating because of it), but if you go to his lectures (which are unendingly interesting) and show some interest in the topic (ask questions!), you should come out with a great grade and a better understanding of our world through sociology.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		4	5	5	5	146938	11/1/06	Great professor. No attendance. Easy quizzes. Plenty of readings but most are pretty interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		4	5	4	4	146938	2/20/06	Lectures are pretty boring but he goes over interesting material, and repeats a lot of material from one class to the next so if you take him once, do it again, you'll have an easy A the next time. Bonus: No textbook! a lot of reading but free reading because he uses articles from the library reserves. Not bad over all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		4	5	5	5	146938	4/4/05	Excellent professor-- I took him for three classes and enjoyed them all. Easy going, helpful, interesting and engaging. Vincent sparked my interest in Sociology in the Intro course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		5	4	5	3	146938	12/15/04	really good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology	101	3	3	4	NULL	146938	2/20/04	about 95% lecture...really boring unless you're interested in that type of stuff (sociology)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vincent Serravallo	3.8	2	Sociology		4	5	5	3	146938	10/18/04	Easy going teacher. Nice guy. Monotone, so kind of boring, but you get to see some movie clips now and then, and a story now and then. No surprises on tests. He doesn't take attendance, which is a good thing!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Muhammad Shaaban	3.2	1	Engineering	551	3	2	3	2	580421	2/25/13	Shaaban's main problem is that he spent a great deal of time explaining simple concepts that could have been covered in 10% of the time. However, his lack of clarity pushed him to explain some concepts too many times. Quizzes and exams are perfectly fine and fair, but the results will be surprisingly low.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Muhammad Shaaban	3.2	2	Engineering		3	4	4	3	580421	1/26/10	Good professor. Gives weekly quizzes on material presented in class and in the notes. The notes are very detailed and easy to understand. If you pay attention, you will do well. Exams are open-book, open-laptop, however quizzes are not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Shagam	2.9	1	Biology		2	3	2	3	1552487	1/25/13	Josh is okay. He's nice, and has a sense of humor. However, he talks himself into circles half the time. Sometimes I have flashbacks to M&P. The tests are also hard, and are too heavily weighted in comparison to projects. This is, after all, a photography class. I want my grade to reflect my projects, not exam grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Shagam	2.9	0	Biology		2	2	2	5	1552487	11/23/11	you should probably just leave now, ask Michael questions you may have
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Shagam	2.9	1	Biology		4	3	3	5	1552487	3/24/11	Things to note: Sideshow Bob, everyday is his birthday, he is his own microscope slide. -- On a more serious note, he's not too shabby as a professor. Unclear on certain things but if you ask him, he will usually clarify. Grading seems to be inconsistant but assignments can always be redone for a higher grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Shagam	2.9	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	1552487	1/23/13	Josh is a good teacher who has been improving! He learns probably faster than any single one of the higher paid professors ... Which translates into guiding his students towards what is really relevant today ... Not in 1980!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joshua Shagam	2.9	0	Biology		2	2	2	4	1552487	10/24/11	Not a great test maker, tough grader, talks too much
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	1535384	3/16/13	She is the best teacher I have ever had in my life. before taking her class calc was a problem and I was scared of it, but she made it so simple and easy to understand and she is very helpful and she makes her class interesting. I took with her Calc 1&2 for ET and I got an A in both of them.I wish she teaches Dif EQ . Thank you prof shannon
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics	231	5	5	5	4	1535384	2/6/13	An absolutely amazing professor, her class was one of the best classes I have had here so far. Very understandable, concise, and always wants you to do well. Would highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics	230	4	5	5	5	1535384	10/22/12	Honestly, the best math teacher I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1535384	1/24/12	Absolute best math teacher you could ever ask for. Had her for Calc I and got an 'A'. Currently have her now for Calc II, she just makes it in terms for students to understand which makes it easier. NO SURPRISES ON QUIZES OR TEST. Weekly hw assignments aren't that much (could be alot worse).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1535384	11/20/11	Great professor, very clear, very simple class. There were no surprises on her tests, just do the HW and study for the easy A. I would take all my math classes with her if I could.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	1535384	11/6/11	extremely good professor! keeps everything simple that everyone can follow along, explanations of things are crystal clear. Sweet and funny lady. Recommend her for anyone taking any math class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics	228	4	5	5	3	1535384	3/7/11	One of my favorite professors. She keeps the class simple: do your homework and study, and you will ace the class. She really commits herself to your success and she is always willing to help. Go to class, do homework and study. The material isn't hard and she makes everything even easier! Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1535384	2/8/13	She is the best math teacher I've ever had for sure. She presents her material very clearly and shows helpful examples for each new topic. Shes nice and easy going as well. All examinations are reasonable, if you take notes you'll be fine. I highly recommend this professor, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	1535384	1/26/13	AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. i strongly recommend everyone to take math with her. She knows how to present the material so everyone understands. the best math professor i have ever had!

Genuinely kind and funny woman. Makes math enjoyable. Knows what she is talking about. Does not give "busy work". Do the home work and the quizes and tests will be easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1535384	11/8/11	Definitely a great teacher to have for such an important class. She makes Calculus seem easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	1535384	10/25/11	She is a nice professor, makes class easy and even fun sometimes, which is hard to say for calculus. Definately reccommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Connie Shannon	5.0	2	Mathematics	228	4	5	5	4	1535384	1/27/11	Very good professor who wants her students to understand the material. Always available and willing to help if you are struggling. Crystal clear and organized classes. I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	0	Science	101	1	1	1	4	67459	3/10/12	Did not update grades on a timely basis. Delivery of material is BORING!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	1	Science		1	3	2	2	67459	2/13/12	Lectures are boring and hard to keep up with. Quizzes are hard. Text has nothing to do with lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	1	Science	508	2	3	3	4	67459	11/17/06	This guy is a "so-so" professor. Lecture are really boring. The weekly readings can be time-consuming. He's very picky when it comes to grading--the quizzes, exams, assignments, and lab reports. Fortunately, the only thing I enjoyed most about this class were conducting outdoor experiments and going on field trips.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	2	Science		2	5	5	NULL	67459	7/9/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	1	Science	101	3	3	3	4	67459	2/22/12	Knows a lot of cool things, but presents them in a very boring way. He posts all of his slides, but they are only an outline for what he talks about in class, so you can't study from them. Quizzes can be tough if you didn't catch the smallest facts in the reading, and tests are rough because they are based on the lecture. Overall an okay class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	1	Science	101	3	2	3	1	67459	10/22/08	He is a nice guy but the class discussions are boring and don't relate to material your tested on. His powerpoint slides are also useless to try and study from. Its an easy course if you read the textbook word for word and memorize definitions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Shearman	3.0	2	Science		3	3	5	1	67459	2/8/06	Class is not bad. He is a funny/interesting guy. Easy reading quiz every week which can be BS'ed for a 8/10. Two exams, no attendance required. Normal liberal arts stuff. A oral report / powerpoint is REQUIRED but he will let you just submit the powerpoint with a 1 page description if you don't want to give an oral report.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History	395	2	5	5	2	663762	12/28/11	Chip is really passionate about art which translates so well in how he delivers his lectures. I had very little interest in Contemporary Art, but after his class walked away with such an appreciation and new found respect for the subject. Highly, highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		3	5	4	2	663762	5/10/11	Chip brought us donuts and made sure we understood everything. He never condescended, and was pleasant to be around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		2	5	4	3	663762	10/22/09	Took him for 20th Century Art 1900-1950. Chip is a great guy & definitely knows his stuff. He is passionate about what he teaches and loves to answer questions & help students. Two 1-page papers are the only assignments but the tests can are kind of hard if youre bad with dates and names. He has a slight but charming southern accent & loves Norway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History	401	3	5	4	5	663762	11/18/08	Extremely dedicated to his job and the information he teaches. Plus, he buys the class coffee and doughnuts sometimes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		3	4	4	4	663762	10/19/07	awesome. knows his stuff. wears a hilarious looking bowtie and calls everyone mr. or miss. has a iphone which is a little bizarre.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	0	Art History		2	2	1	4	663762	7/30/06	He really likes the sound of his own voice. He jumps all over the place and loves to repeat himself. Absent minded and doesn't seem very interested in the student, you can approach him and he will talk about himself, but will never ask or become interested in the student themself. He is a nice guy, but not my choice for a professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	1	Art History		4	3	3	1	663762	2/7/06	I dreaded going to this class.I have never been so bored in a lecture class in my life.I found his accent hard to listen to, and I missed words b/c of it.If you enjoy slide after slide, this is the class for you. Papers were extremely easy, and the tests were mainly memorization with a few essays that he allowed you to prepare for ahead of time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		2	5	5	5	663762	9/16/05	best teacher i've ever had at RIT. take one of his classes, he has so much insight into art history and contemporary art. he really makes you think and keeps you interested in the subject!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		4	5	5	4	663762	11/25/11	Chip is AWESOME. What a boss. So passionate about what he teaches and really willing to help if you need it. Definitely my favorite prof so far at RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History	435	2	5	5	4	663762	5/24/10	Chip is enlightening, invigorating, and extraordinary! Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		1	5	5	4	663762	10/21/09	Hardworking passionate professor. Makes sure to but detailed comments when returning all essays. Friendly, kind, and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	2	Art History		2	5	5	5	663762	6/15/08	Sheffield really steps up his classes to a whole new level Ive never experienced. He really gave me a drive to want to succeed in his class, even though it was really challenging and time consuming. Thumbs up!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chip Sheffield	4.3	1	Art History		3	4	1	4	663762	7/30/06	Definitely knows his stuff, but often can't convey the material in a clear and interesting way. Lectures are extremely dry and repetitive. Tests on material not covered in class. Approachable, though has a tendency to condescend and is somewhat pretentious. Yes, you will learn in his class, but it is often excruciatingly slow and painful

Rochester Institute of Technology	Luvon Sheppard	2.0	0	Fine Arts		5	2	2	5	1448309	11/20/12	Super laid back and funny guy, I really liked him as a person but as a professor he was not very helpful. If you take his class you better come in very motivated to work on your own because he will not give you much incentive to try hard. That being said it was a pretty easy class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Sherman	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1370569	9/4/12	Great teacher, fun class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Edward Sherman	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1370569	8/4/10	Had him for Dodgeball and Team Handball, wicked cool guy

Rochester Institute of Technology	Pengcheng Shi	5.0	2	Computer Science	811	3	5	5	4	1710131	4/15/12	Useful course for PhD research. Great teacher, very different from other professors at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John  Shoemaker	2.5	1	Philosophy	210	2	2	3	1	1772499	11/28/12	Boring and useless about sums him up. He extracted arguments which were his own opinion from an outdated textbook, and then tested on nonsense that you will NEVER use in ANY career field. It was disappointing to hear from colleagues who took a very practical philosophy class. He would also teach for two hours straight with no break. Do not take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		2	4	4	3	251453	3/19/09	He is tough... but if you want to learn his the way to go. He is very helpful outside of the classroom also. One of two best professors I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	251453	10/14/05	Tough professor, asks a lot of you. He really cares how you do in his courses. Willing to help out a struggling student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	251453	4/27/05	the best faculty I ever came across.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	5	251453	11/17/06	he really IS a walking encyclopedia...he knows so d*mn much about programming and design patterns and of course his compiler stuff. His grading can give you a heart attack, expect the worst, or expect the not-expected, and prepare to be surprised when you do check your grade in the end..! His material is hardcore, be serious and do the work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	251453	8/31/05	One of thee best teachers. If you are a slacker ha! You are ****ed! You will be taking the class agian. Take the time to humble yourself, and go to his office hours if you need to. He is one smart teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Axel-Tobias Shreiner	4.7	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	NULL	251453	9/19/03	Excellent professor. He's a walking encyclopedia!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean  Sims Follow SeanRIT	4.0	2	Information Technology	320	4	4	4	4	1767653	11/28/12	Wonderful Professor. He is helpful during in-class exercises and office hours if you need help with projects and other exercises. The exams should be easy. Very fair graders on projects. I recommend to take this professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean  Sims Follow SeanRIT	4.0	2	Information Technology	320	4	4	4	5	1767653	11/26/12	Great professor. Teaches off the slides for the lectures, but is very helpful during in-class exercises. Good guy, interesting class. Always felt prepared for the exams. The exam practicals are easy, but you should study the slides for the multiple choice. Fair grader on tests and projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil Shaw	4.8	2	Writing	101	3	5	4	1	1628718	11/12/12	Good teacher, fair grader, funny, hasmproved my writing

Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil Shaw	4.8	2	Writing	227	3	5	4	2	1628718	10/25/11	Very good teacher, makes a dull subject interesting with an element of humor. The class uses an effective textbook, which lays out writing in an understandable set of 5 sections. Very down-to-earth, and is quite personable. I recommend people to take his classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil Shaw	4.8	2	Writing		4	5	5	4	1628718	10/24/11	He's funny and entertaining. Makes the boring material interesting. Fair grading. Helpful. Definitely recommended!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology	545	1	1	1	5	579263	2/16/13	Doesn't really understand networking, except for some protocols which she knows well. Zero hands-on experience. Put a router in front of her and she's totally lost. Hard to understand. No laptops in class, which makes taking notes hard. AVOID.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology	582	1	1	2	5	579263	11/1/09	Like the commenter below, I also took the exact same class. She does not understand the content she is teaching and is very hard to understand. Talks down to undergrads and does not allow laptops in class. Avoid like the plague. She made be physically depressed when listening to her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology		2	2	1	4	579263	2/28/06	Even though i sat up on the front row, it was very tough to understand her. Heavy indian accent and often misused english word. Use transparancy instead powerpoint presentation in class. She does not know what a "NAT Port Forwarding" but is part of IEEE Communcation Group. What the....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology		3	2	2	5	579263	2/2/06	Does not understand or explain questions effectivley. Relies heavily on powerpoint. Also misses many classes and has replacement profs due to frequent travel. Very slow to get graded work returned, which she does not grade herself. Her overall knowledge doesn't seem to be that great; I expected more from RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology		3	1	1	5	579263	5/7/05	Indian Teacher- had difficulty with the english language and explaining things clearly. Answered questions ineffectively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	5	579263	1/20/13	She is not responsible and even humiliating students. In 2 hours class usually teach 45 minutes - just quickly read through the powerpoint. Reading PPT is the only thing she does for this class. And the voice is low and the English is hard to understand. And she has an attitude about everything although she is not knowledgeable about networking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology	582	2	1	2	3	579263	10/14/09	Doesn't teach so much as read off powerpoint slides. The first day she told us "This class will require you to heavily code in NesC. I don't know much about it so you're on your own." Told us we had an hour for our midterm (online), gave us 45minutes, 40 questions multiple choice, 5 short answer. Avoid her like the plague.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology	342	2	2	1	1	579263	2/26/06	Doesn't seem to care if u learn or not. She has trouble with english, if your good in networking your probably ok other wise avoide her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology	515	3	1	1	5	579263	10/25/05	If she can get a PHD then i should have no problem
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nirmala Shenoy	1.3	0	Information Technology		1	1	1	1	579263	3/11/05	She is most stupid person I came accros
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	4	124897	12/3/06	Fantastic teacher. quizzes every week but not that difficult if u read the long but interesting textbook. lectures are a littel long...but she is an honestly dedicated teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History	301	5	5	4	3	124897	11/7/06	The class is taught in a very nice manner where the final is just an essay and weekly quizzes (where you dont need to remember information past that quiz for the class, which is amazing) However she does have strong liberal values and she tries to spread them during her class, which I do not think should be done; let people decide their own opinion
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History		5	5	5	NULL	124897	2/4/04	Sheridan is an awesome professor. Her class very interesting and you really learn a lot.The quizzes are really easy as long as you pay attention and do the reading. There's no midterm or final exam, only a final paper which is actually really interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History		4	5	5	NULL	124897	3/17/03	Great professor! One of the best at RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History		4	3	4	2	124897	11/11/06	Classes were kinda boring if you dont like history. Quizes were easy as long as you read the 20 boring pages in the book and pay attention to the one hour documentary she makes you sit through once a week. Class wasnt difficult just boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History	101	4	5	5	4	124897	5/15/05	very knowledgable, teaches in a simple manner. likes interacting with students, talking about interesting things, easy to understand. would take her again any time!
Rochester Institute of Technology	 Sheradin	4.7	2	History		5	5	5	NULL	124897	11/11/03	great teacher. Very realistic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Sherman	4.5	2	Design	101	2	4	4	5	928032	1/26/10	I have had Kim for Form I, Form II, Solidworks intro, Equipment Design, and Advanced Product Design. Expect to work hard, but when making a portfolio piece it should be top notch work. Great teacher, if you don't think so then you probably didn't take his class seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Sherman	4.5	2	Design		2	5	4	1	928032	12/4/06	He really wants people to learn, and is always willing to give individual help. If you don't keep pace with him in class, you will probably fall behind. Kim is very helpful, and is equally as nice. He wants to see perfection in your final work, and gets very excited over a great execution of it. A professor worth taking!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kim Sherman	4.5	2	Design		4	5	5	5	928032	2/4/07	Kim is an excellent professor for learning the basics of Solidworks. He is always willing to answer questions. There was reasonable time given for projects and most of the work is done in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rebecca Shick	1.5	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	2	1	974673	4/9/07	Not clear, and does NOT have office hours. She never replies to e-mails if asking for help or clarification on homework. Exams are always too long and too much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Shipman	3.0	0	Science		2	2	2	4	416123	10/4/11	Great guy, very unorganized. Super nice and wants to help, he just doesn't organize very well, exams are pretty much all memorization.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Shipman	3.0	2	Science		3	5	5	5	416123	10/31/06	great parner to conversating at Java's, always intouthiastic about everything, a person of insparation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Shipman	3.0	2	Science		4	4	4	3	416123	1/27/05	One of the better intro bio professors ive ever had. Is very charismatic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Shipman	3.0	0	Science	302	4	1	1	4	416123	11/19/10	This guy is terrible. Following the final exam, I felt like I wasted 10 weeks of my life. His lectures are not well organized, he didn't get us a grade 'till week 6, and he is just not a very intelligent person. He copied pages out of another professors book, made them into slides, and read them to us. AVOID AT ALL COSTS

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Shore	3.0	0	Physics		2	2	2	3	1541449	3/3/13	Intends well but does not make good use of class time or prepare students well for exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Shore	3.0	2	Physics		3	5	5	2	1541449	12/2/11	I liked Dr. Shore. He's a great teacher and is easy to get along with, plus he's helpful during labs. I'd recommend him to others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Shore	3.0	1	Physics		2	3	2	5	1541449	1/27/12	Dr. Shore has good intentions, but his ability to teach is lacking and I can't recommend him to anyone who actually needs to LEARN physics. He reads off slides for lectures and assigns problems out of a packet for workshop. These problems do little to prepare you for the tests (which, btw, are a huge part of your grade). Avoid if possible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Shore	3.0	1	Physics	201	3	2	3	3	1541449	3/8/11	Took him for PHY 2, not a bad guy. Very smart but the lecutures were quite boring. Fair grader and always helped with a curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	501	4	5	5	5	977391	1/31/13	Siena is great, although he had to leave during the middle of the quarter the time we did have with him was very enjoyable. Most entertaining 6-10p class I've taken. He teaches with stories from his experience. Very funny and helpful professor. He is awesome... and not bad on the eyes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	400	5	5	5	3	977391	3/14/12	If he marked you as incorrect for a test question but you provided a good argument such as citing one of his previous lectures or the textbook, he would award you full credit for the answer.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	977391	9/2/07	Awesome guy, he tells a multitude of stories that relate to the topic on hand... most are very humorous. His tests are fair, just read the main topics of the book and you'll be set. Probably the best teacher I've had so far, very enjoyable and I looked forward to it every morning at 8am so that's saying something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	4	977391	12/2/12	This is my second course with sps and I highly recommend him as a professor. His teaching style and methods always spark my interest..he also isn't bad on the eyes. I would strongly suggest taking a course with this instructor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	101	3	5	5	4	977391	10/16/07	Great class!! He teaches from experience and with a lot of great stories! Made the class fun and the material memorable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Siena	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	443	4	5	5	5	977391	4/30/07	One of the best professors around, gets us to THINK!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	1	Mathematics		1	2	3	3	729944	3/4/13	The quizzes and homeworks are basically pointless because, 80% of your grade is the Final Exam. Homeworks are very difficult and he does not give them back. Quizzes are extremely hard for no reason, because they are "easy points".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	282	2	5	5	5	729944	5/24/12	Best math teacher i have had. Everything is explained clearly. Notes are fill in the blank power-point slides which, so you won't have to worry about rushing to take notes. He's really laid back and hes pretty funny (for a teacher) Homeworks are the horrendous, but help is available. I would definitely take one of his classes again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	2	729944	2/27/12	Awesome guy, reminds me of the high school teachers I always miss. Organized with handouts and powerpoints. Horribly strict grading and the homework makes you want to jump off a cliff. Weekly quizzes are easy. Allows you to retake one exam. Wish I did better in the course but the content was really tough. He has a Mexican accent you'll get used to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	305	3	5	5	4	729944	1/24/12	Awesome Teacher! He Knows what he's talking about, makes everything easy to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	1	Mathematics		1	3	3	3	729944	11/17/11	Horrible at provinding immediate feedback, and when asked for help will try to send you to the math center. Not the teacher if you hate powerpoint, none the less using power point slides for notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	313	3	5	5	5	729944	2/8/11	I had him for Proj Based Calc I, II, III and Multi-V. He is hands down the most amazing professor I've had. Period. He genuinely cares if we're learning/understanding the material, is hilarious, and will help you outside the classroom, too. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	4	729944	11/22/10	Very nice guy. Gives very clear examples in class for every topic covered, and if you study just those examples, you'll understand everything well enough to get an A without ever opening the book. Gives very hard homeworks and comparatively easy tests, so as long as you do the HW you'll be well prepared. Grades the course very fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	5	729944	10/24/10	if you already know the concepts of multivariable, he will have fun testing you, if you dont, you will spend a lot of outside time studying for this class but if you enjoy calculus (like i do) you will highly enjoy this professor. If you dont have an interest in calc, this professor is not for you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	281	2	5	5	4	729944	6/14/10	I had Simon Romero for Calc 1, 2, and 3 as a part of a learning community and he is a great teacher. He wants you to succeed if you show effort and he is extremely helpful in office hours. If you want to learn Calculus, he will give you a challenge but you will learn so much!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	729944	2/20/09	Awesome professor!!! A must take if you can get him. He's great at explaining the material. Very funny and helpful, wants you to succeed. His accent is a little rough at first but you get used to it fast unlike some other professors. Overall if you do all the work your suppose to and understand it then its an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		1	4	5	5	729944	11/14/12	His grading is harsh but fair. The workload for the class is insane. He is a good professor very clear and helpful. Jokes around a bit too much. Not the professor you want to take if your other classes have a big workload already, but definitely take him if you want to improve your math skills. You will have to work extremely hard just to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	571	2	5	4	5	729944	5/17/12	The ONLY issue I have with him is that he tends to take a long time to hand things back. Otherwise, he's an EXTREMELY helpful professor who tends to have no problem pushing back assignments if you need more time (provided you visit his office). Homework's evil, but the exams are mostly definitions and easy homework proofs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	729944	2/1/12	Very hard. Grades very hard. gives very little partial credit and homeworks take hours. But he is the best calc teacher I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	729944	11/27/11	Absolutely one of the best professors for math. He knows everything you ask him, and makes it clear that he wants you to know everything too. If you can get past the accent and the heavy homework load, you'll have absolutely nothing to worry about in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		1	4	5	2	729944	11/9/11	Hard grader but a great teacher. Dont expect your quiz grades back until finals week. Very funny and loves to plank in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	1	Mathematics	411	4	2	4	3	729944	1/21/11	He is really difficult, but he explains very well. A lot of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	4	729944	11/6/10	Fun professor, but exams are hard, homeworks are hard and if you want a decent grade you have to spend time working on calc outside of class at a minimum of four hours. He grades tough even if you make a math error but have the concept correct he takes off a lot of points. if you want an easy teacher don't take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	729944	8/3/10	Really great teacher who really loves Math and cares about his students learning. Hard tests that take a little while to get used to, but very fair. Really pushes his students with hard tests, workshops, and project but its definitely possible to get an A if you work hard. Only complaint is he spends too much time goofing around and joking
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	729944	11/11/09	He was a great teacher, accent was heard in the beginning but now I have no problem with it. He's funny and very helpful. I enjoyed going to class and the tests and quizzes where not hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	729944	2/4/09	HE is a very helpful, funny and laid-back man. He has a russian accent but it isn't thick. He's a really good drawer too. He makes funny little heads outta the guys in the first row. His grading policies aren't terrible, but he is strict with dishing out partial credit. Just make sure you write down all the formulas you used. Overall, a great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	305	4	5	5	5	729944	8/20/07	He makes it really fun and interesting. He does drawings on the board during lectures and gives really great notes. He explains everything really well and he will explain it to you further if need be. His quizzes are one every week but if you do the homework you ace them. The questions are copied off the homework. The tests are pretty easy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	729944	2/7/07	Great teacher, gives excellent notes and explains very well. Cracks jokes and is very laid back. Tests/grading is reasonable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	729944	2/12/06	Oh, I totally love him! he is so much fun with the accent, jokes, cartoons and so much more! Would reccomend him for any class. Having him next quarter too! YAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	729944	1/25/06	Aside from his thick accent he is a great teacher. His explanations are clear, and he is one of the most helpful and friendly teachers I've ever had. Homework and tests are not easy, but they are fair. Would highly recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics	281	3	5	5	3	729944	10/19/05	Good teacher, adds some humor, uses people from the class as examples. Definitely gets the material across and is always willing to help out the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	4	729944	5/1/07	Had him for Real Variables I and II. He is amazing, funny, and challenging. One of the most helpful professors I have ever met. Take him now.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	3	729944	2/1/07	Good teacher but grades very unfairly. Due to an error by his grader, I was unaware of a mistake I was making on one type of problem. I lost 15% off of my grade from one problem on the second test. When show that I was given full credit for my method on the quiz but not the test, he tried to take points off my quiz.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	3	729944	2/6/06	Fun guy, great sense of humor. The accent isn't too bad. He has problems explaining things sometimes though, and I HATE his homework style. It kills practicing the material (no immediate incentive) and thus leads to lower grades. He's good for some people and very bad for others, including me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Likin Simon-Romero	4.2	1	Mathematics	282	3	5	1	3	729944	11/22/05	Nice guy, a little trouble understanding his accent at first but you get used to it. Has an odd way of explaining things that may be confusing if you've had calculus before with someone else. Helpful though, and quite funny at times. Overall: a great guy, but a sometimes little confusing. You'll should be fine if you just "make like a graph".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alan Singer	2.2	0	Fine Arts		2	2	2	2	1410394	11/23/12	He was not clear on some of the projects he had us complete
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Siple	3.6	0	Languages	203	1	1	3	1	139882	10/16/08	Linda plays favorites and is very condescending to students she does not prefer. If you are on her good side, how lovely for you I'm sure your world is just fine. However if you are on her bad side... she is evil. I believe she derives great pleasure from making students cry and degrading them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Siple	3.6	2	Languages		4	5	4	4	139882	10/23/06	She is concerned for her students, and is very easy to talk to. Manages class time well, and has interesting homework assignments. Can be a little overzealous about feelings but overall it was a good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Siple	3.6	1	Languages	211	4	2	4	3	139882	11/13/06	Can be helpful, but at the same time talks down to students like they are children. can also be obnoxious and an unfair grader on papers. wonderful with quizes, sucky with papers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Linda Siple	3.6	2	Languages		2	5	5	NULL	139882	2/19/03	Pushes you to be your best! Generally concerned for her students welfare.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	366606	3/24/11	Awesome Professor, really helpful in class and life in general. Grades VERY VERY VERY HARD! She will help if you ask, but she is an extremely tough grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	1	366606	2/13/10	She is really nice but HARD. She doesn't really relate to any real-world situations. Many people have decided to leave Biomed Photo because she pretty much killed the motivation. Good luck if you have to take her for 3 quarters.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	0	Fine Arts		1	2	2	4	366606	1/13/09	Makes you buy expensive textbooks that you barely use. Gives pop quizzes yet makes no mention of this in the syllabus. Like other people have said, she is an extremely tough grader. Tests you on things she never taught. But she is nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	4	366606	12/3/07	She's a really nice person, but her grading is hard! Make sure you know your stuff. She's very helpful and always willing to answer questions. Slow to respond to e-mails though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	5	366606	12/1/05	Just do the work. She's a pretty cool lady and wants to see her students do well. Quizzes are expected and fair. I didn't fall asleep in her class like I have in others here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	0	Fine Arts		1	1	2	2	366606	8/31/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	366606	8/25/10	Very hard grader, but offers you the option of redoing any assignment, which will ALWAYS bump your grade by a letter or so. Tests are very hard, but only if you have no idea what you are doing. If you DO the assigned reading and learn the concepts, the tests are much easier. DON'T BE LAZY! READ THE DIRECTIONS ON ASSIGNMENTS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	5	366606	2/3/10	Taking Biomed Photo 1 with her currently. It's near the end of the second quarter. Her tests are HARD, but not unfairly so. They require you to have an understanding of the material, not routine memorization like everyone is used to. She is very personable and easy to talk to. As for assignments, add 10% to convert it to a normal profs. grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	3	4	5	366606	10/15/08	EXTREMELY hard grader. The reason my GPA is low. Very nice, but ... VERY hard grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	4	366606	1/30/06	She is really a great teacher, but she wont let you off easy! Make sure you study your notes all along becuase her tests are hard! She will allways help if you need it so just ask!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	366606	10/26/05	Fair amount of work load. Quizzes are common sense. She's easy going.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christye Sisson	3.6	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	366606	3/15/04	Great prof, down to earth and fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sally Skyer	5.0	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1625721	1/19/12	AMAZING counselor ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Slay	4.5	2	Business		3	4	4	4	767066	2/15/07	Not too bad of a class. Pretty interesting material. She is a tough teacher, but very nice and easy going. She wants you to learn, and she can teach it to you. She knows her stuff. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Slay	4.5	2	Business		2	5	5	2	767066	11/29/05	Class: Organizational Behavior. Somewhat difficult, but professor was great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Holly Slay	4.5	2	Business		3	4	5	2	767066	11/29/06	Great teacher. She knows her stuff. Keeps the class interested. The group project is semi-difficult, if your group sucks. The class is not too hard if you study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	2	1054765	12/5/12	He was very obvious about what he required you to know. He continually emphasized key vocabulary. Classes were entertaining because he likes to joke around. There was ample time for projects (although he does not help you the week before the projects are due because knows you have procrastinated.) He also makes a lot of references to applications.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		2	1	2	1	1054765	11/25/11	Well if you want to hear the word "industry" repeated 500 times, this is the guy you want to take. Really annoying prof. Flies through notes, and doesn't explain thoroughly. His quizzes online are obnoxiously long and he tries to play tricks on his questions. If you can avoid having him as a prof. I would.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	2	Engineering	220	2	5	5	3	1054765	10/29/10	MP1: Great teacher; very difficult assessments, but fair in the end. I learned alot in his class, and learning was easy. Grades were demoralizing at first but you should focus more on what he has to say than grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	1054765	5/30/10	I had him for MP1 and MP2 and he is by far the worst professor ever. Don't listen to people saying he is preparing for the real world because he isn't; he continues to make a mockery out of you and looks down upon you and never guides you to success. He is extremely rude and do not hesistate to complain to the MET department about his rudeness!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		2	1	1	3	1054765	11/3/09	Awesome guy, but the worst teacher I have ever had. Loads you with work at the end of the quarter. He has a hard time answering any questions, can't ever talk, terrible at presenting any material, and does not stick to the syllabus. He has a lot of experience in industry, but it doesn't show at all. Try to avoid him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	1	Engineering		3	2	3	3	1054765	11/18/08	doesnt give out much work until the end of the quarter, and then he loads you down with essays and other hw. he is very bad at making tests. if you take his class plan on spending 30 hours a week between studying and hw.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	2	Engineering		2	4	5	4	1054765	11/13/07	Lost of homework and tests loaded towards end of quarter. Do the homework and study a little, and you are guaranteed an A or B, depending on your ability to retain the text
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		2	1	3	3	1054765	11/28/11	Did not stick to schedule of course and neglected to inform students of this. Long online quizes which had nothing to do with information discussed in class. Occasionally rude to students. Class made me want to fall asleep 80% of the time. Three lengthy projects were given at one time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	1	Engineering		2	2	3	3	1054765	1/30/11	mediocre teacher. seems quite disorganized. constantly changing schedule around which gets annoying when a teachers organization affects yours so greatly. WAY too much busy work for such a simple class.Less B.S.ing in class would make less busy work possible. stop with the jokes and get to the point. Hes a Great guy & cares for his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		2	2	1	2	1054765	10/24/10	I took him for MP1 and 2 by far the coolest teacher ever. You can tell he has a lot of experience in the engineering industry but teaching is definitely not his forte. He is a terrible teacher and he jokes around a lot. His exams are insanely hard and the class average was a 50 with no curves. Prepare to study the txtbk if you want to score well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering		1	1	2	1	1054765	11/19/09	He is a very cool guy, but terrible at teaching. He likes to give out ridiculous quizzes that everyone fails and the class average is a 60. He doesn't give any curves, which is ridiculous consider how bad people are doing in the class. He piles up 3 quizzes and 3 essays 1 week before finals week. I recommend not having him at all!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	2	Engineering	220	4	5	5	4	1054765	11/18/08	He is straight froward. tells you exactly whats on the tests and quizzes. He is pretty cool wil give breaks during class and will joke around. He has lots of experience in the field of manufacturing so trying to get some connection out of him is a good plan too. overall a good rounded teacher (lol)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Slifka	2.6	0	Engineering	617	3	1	1	4	1054765	5/21/08	The guy is a horrible professor and in my opinion is stealing money from the students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adrianne Smith	4.0	2	Literature		3	4	4	2	1502456	5/21/11	She is an effective teacher and does not give a lot of work but is a hard grader. Only 1 pop quiz so reading isn't really that important. Seems concerned about how her students are doing in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Smith	3.2	1	Economics		3	2	3	2	1404236	3/7/13	I thought he was a bad teacher. He went off a tangents and what he says in class isnt on the test but read the book and you will do fine. I missed 2 weeks and i got a B. Make sure you do the myecon lab also.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Smith	3.2	2	Economics		4	4	4	3	1404236	3/1/10	Class tests are taken right out of the textbook. If you do the Myeconlab HW and quizzes and understand them, you will ace the tests. Not widely available outside of class, but helpful in telling you what chapters to study. READ THE BOOK AND YOU WILL DO FINE
Rochester Institute of Technology	Craig Smith	3.2	1	Economics		5	3	3	1	1404236	11/18/11	Very easy teacher. Went to about half the classes and got an A. Just do the online homework (which is actually very helpful) and you will do fine on the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Darren  Smith	5.0	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	4	1756722	2/17/13	Tough grader but explains things really well. Will always make things more clear if you go to office hours or ask a question. Probably the best lab instructor I've had to date.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elizabeth Smith	4.5	2	Political Science		3	4	5	4	723014	10/11/05	she is a fun teacher to have. she has a funny voice, but its easy to learn and get what you need out of the class. really good choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	2	Engineering		5	5	5	3	1333331	6/14/12	Great teacher that walks you through how to do everything step by step in class. Definitely will ensure you learn it. You have class exercises that he will help you with and tell you what mistakes you made. Class exercises are almost identical to the home work and exams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	2	Engineering		3	4	5	4	1333331	10/25/11	Nice guy, knows what he is doing, likes to joke around. Really cool accent that makes class a little fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	2	Engineering		4	5	3	5	1333331	11/30/09	Great Professor. Knows his stuff extremely well. Very interesting and helpful. Willing to explain things multiple times if needed. Makes a 3 hour class feel like a 1 hour. Great experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	2	Engineering		4	5	3	4	1333331	10/28/11	Great professor. Very helpful. Love his accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	1	Engineering	211	4	4	1	4	1333331	10/22/10	Very thick accent. Besides that a pretty good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rizk Sinada	4.0	2	Engineering		3	5	3	3	1333331	11/7/09	Great Professor, very helpful, and is an amazing teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Murli Sinha	4.0	2	Sociology		4	4	3	3	807051	5/1/08	He's awesome. Tells some good stories and there isn't a lot of work involved in the class. Interesting stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Murli Sinha	4.0	2	Sociology		4	5	5	5	807051	6/15/06	By far the best sociology professor I've had (and Im a soc. major so I've had a lot) Tells a lot of good stories that really help you understand. Very interesting and committed to helping you learn. Highly recommended by me!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Murli Sinha	4.0	2	Sociology		3	5	4	3	807051	10/19/06	A great class to take if you have any interest in global politics or international problems. He takes his own personal experiences and allows you to relate to the topics at hand. Very helpful when it comes to writing your final paper.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Arnie Sirlin	2.0	2	Film		1	3	5	4	267914	12/19/04	Arnie is without a doubt the hardest film prof. His teaching style seems to be, "do it right the first time, or you're gonna get yelled at and belittled." He definitely knows his stuff, though, and you definitely will learn something.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arnie Sirlin	2.0	2	Film		1	4	3	NULL	267914	5/4/04	experienced, high expectations, friendly, shell shocked from being in LA for a prolonged period of time... you're kidding yourself if you don't take at least one of his special topics classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arnie Sirlin	2.0	0	Film		1	1	1	3	267914	10/26/05	Very unclear teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Arnie Sirlin	2.0	0	Film		1	2	2	4	267914	8/30/05	He knows what he is talking about but can not teach it for**** to people who know nothing of the subject. If you have some knowledge of a subject and want to learn more he would be VERY good, just not a freshman class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Arnie Sirlin	2.0	0	Film		3	2	2	NULL	267914	4/17/04	He's awful. He tends to ramble. He did eight westerns, and "Bud the Chud".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Skuse	4.0	2	Biotechnology		5	5	4	3	1103147	10/26/10	Skuse is a great teacher! Really chill, funny and wants you to understand whats going on in lab. Always willing to help till you understand the material. Labs are generally pretty easy, and you can leave class as soon as you finish. Best yet, no tests, quizzes or homework. Would recommend in a second!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Skuse	4.0	2	Biotechnology		5	5	3	3	1103147	2/14/08	Excellent teacher! Really talks a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gary Skuse	4.0	2	Biotechnology	260	5	4	3	4	1103147	10/26/09	Awesome teacher. No for for Intro. to Bioinformatics. Funny and always plays rock solos are beginning of class. 3 tests, amazingly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Slack	2.5	0	Electrical Engineering	240	1	1	1	5	1030049	4/10/10	This guy is the worst professor at RIT. He doesn't have a PHD yet he is teaching classes! He is useless both in and outside the classroom. He doesn't care whether you learn the material or not. Read the textbook that's the only way you are going to pass the class. I swear this guy should be straight up fired.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Slack	2.5	0	Electrical Engineering	240	3	1	1	1	1030049	4/30/08	He is bad
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Slack	2.5	2	Electrical Engineering		3	5	4	1	1030049	9/17/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Slack	2.5	2	Electrical Engineering	205	5	4	3	4	1030049	11/9/09	He's a good guy and the class didn't require much teaching, but he relied heavily on his teaching assistant and all we really did was come in, sit down, read the lab, do the lab, and leave.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Slack	2.5	1	Electrical Engineering	340	3	3	2	2	1030049	4/30/08	He a nice guy, but his analogies and teaching method leaves you confused a lot on what he is talking about. He he famous for the saying "It's really easy." When slack says this most of the time people in the class were lost on what was actually happening
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Sleeman	5.0	2	Physical Ed		5	5	5	5	620897	10/16/07	This guy is pretty psyched about archery. He really made you WANT to do better, takes a very active part in the class and helps students on an individual level. This was a really fun class, and he wasn't taking the class way too seriously like the guy who teaches Ultimate Frisbee..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Sleeman	5.0	2	Physical Ed		5	5	5	5	620897	5/16/05	This guy's awesome. His archery class is very enjoyable and he's knowledgeable in this field. He encourages you to practice and sometimes gives chocolates after the class! I think I'll take archery as a lifelong recreational activity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Alexander Sleeman	5.0	2	Physical Ed		5	5	5	3	620897	10/23/06	Wellness for Life. Boring class, but he's a very nice man. The class can't help itself but be boring, but deal with it. No hmwk, quizzes, tests, etc. Just show up and you get your uni credit A. Don't skip more than 2 classes otherwise you could potentially fail. Just go and deal with it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		2	5	4	4	567259	4/28/12	Adam is by far my favorite professor after 3 years of being at RIT. He is passionate, extremely inspiring and helpful as long as you ask for help when needed. He may come off as a bit harsh sometimes but he is honestly interested in the students and their success. A must take high caliber professor for design students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		3	5	5	5	567259	11/29/11	Is very tough on your designs but will always offer constructive criticism and works hard for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	3	4	4	567259	1/5/11	Adam is nuts. He's amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	5	5	5	567259	1/27/10	Adam is awesome, I'm proud to have him as a teacher. He's one of the hardest professors I've ever had in that he only expects excellence and I think everyone who's had him has benefited from it. He has all my respect and thanks for making me into a better and more driven NMDesigner.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	5	5	5	567259	9/10/09	Adam is the best teacher I've ever had. He really knows what he's talking about and he loves what he does. He comes off as a jerk but he will do anything to get you a job or help you as long as you're willing to put in the effort. He pushed me to create projects I didnt even know I was capable of and I learned so much. I think this man is a genius.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	5	4	5	567259	10/19/07	I actually wonder if there is something about new media that he doesn't know. a great teacher and a mentor, very hard tho.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		2	4	5	4	567259	9/6/05	Adam is a good proff no matter what anyone says. He pushes you hard and makes you think about what you are doing. Sometimes I felt I could never get an A....oh wait I never did with him. Way to ruin my GPA by deans list every quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	0	Design		2	1	1	1	567259	2/7/05	Adam Smith has a problem that you cannot fix. Beware.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	4	4	4	567259	1/24/12	Adam is simply a genius. He may come off as an pain in the butt, but all in all, he really knows his stuff when it comes to New Media. Aside from our other NMD professor, he's the hardest one of all and yet he really knows how to make you improve. I've only been with him for a year and I've made hurdles in my designs already. Just work hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design	101	1	4	5	4	567259	5/26/11	Nice guy. He does seem brash, but he is more than willing to help if you approach him. A bit dramatic sometimes, but overall he ended up grading everyone higher than they expected, so he truly does appreciate your effort in the end, if you apply it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	1	Design	413	2	2	3	4	567259	3/7/10	Intolerably dramatic. He is capable of being helpful, but, most of the time, he is too brash to approach. He acts holy and assumes you desperately want him as your mentor. He constantly puts your work down and gets satisfaction from having you crawl back to him for feedback. The fact that he can be helpful is nullified by his own self absorption.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		1	5	5	5	567259	10/21/09	This man is the best teacher in the world. True, he will frusterate you and push you to your breaking point, but he is only doing it because he wants you to succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		2	5	5	5	567259	12/2/08	best teacher I've ever had, after 4 years. hands down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		2	5	5	5	567259	9/18/05	I had Adam as a professor in many classes. He was always helpful and knowledgeable in many of classes he taught - unlike a lot of other professors  I have had. He has a lot of ideas as well as resources - a good professor to have on your side. After graduating - I find there are still things that he has said in class that pertain to future projects. He isnt an easy professor, but he is a good one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Adam Smith	4.2	2	Design		2	5	4	2	567259	6/16/05	fun, but really hard. adam is always willing to help, especially if he sees you trying hard and putting in the effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Smith	5.0	2	Engineering	221	2	5	5	4	343139	4/27/08	He didnt dumb down a lot of the material, just because it was an intro level course, so the scores on the test looked bad a lot, but you only need like an 18 / 100 to pass with the scale he used. This may sound bad, but I actually learned more in this class than any other class Ive taken. Hands down one of the best teachers there is!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Smith	5.0	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	343139	9/2/05	one of the best teachers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Smith	5.0	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	343139	10/18/05	The class is not hard if you pay attention. Don't miss any because there's no book and you have to rely on hand outs. Just read and do the homework more than 5 minutes before class and you're more than set for the test. The tests are often direct rips from the homwork.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	1	Sociology	210	2	4	2	2	613339	8/30/11	Went off topic a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology		5	3	4	4	613339	11/25/10	She was a really nice person but not a great teacher. She seemed lost a lot of time and couldn't really get a hand on the class in terms of participation. Overall, it was an easy class though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology		1	2	2	4	613339	11/8/10	I was interested in the subject before she began talking. She talks about irrelevant subject matter. She requires 4 essays and a 6 page research paper with an oral presentation. She criticizes individuals in class. The tests are hard and they do not relate to anything she talks about in class. Heavy reading of the text is required. Bad teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology		3	1	2	4	613339	2/4/09	She was not helpful at all and her lectures never made any sense. She did not always follow the syllabus which made it hard to know when assignments were do. She assigned groups the first class to work on projects with but the whole group kind of failed. If you can take another professor she sucks!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	1	Sociology		4	4	2	1	613339	5/22/08	Smith is a nice lady but she is a bit flighty, and is sometimes inappropriate in the way she jokes around with students. Nonetheless, I recommend her if you are not a sociology major. She is very helpful if you see her outside of class and the class is an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology		2	4	4	2	613339	10/24/07	Very engaging, knows material, lots of experiments - highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	1	Sociology		5	3	3	4	613339	3/29/06	She is a bit on the dumb side You take field trips and watch movies so shes not bad if you dont mind her being flighty For our fieldtrip to a mall I said how the color me beautiful stand is offensive and she wrote back how much she likes the makeup. Not about how they imply you have to use their make up to be beautiful, but how much she liked it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology		3	1	2	1	613339	3/2/06	she is very here and there...she jokes around with students too much and sometimes rambles. if she isnt clear about something or said the wrong info she insists the entire class jus wasn't listening. her gradeing system doesnt really make too much sense.I wouldnt take this class again. (and sometimes her accent is hard to understand)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology		4	3	1	3	613339	11/18/05	Danielle is very nice-and the class is fairly easy. She's passionate about what she does as well. However, for our final research paper HALF of the class misunderstood that we needed to create our own surveys/forms of research. She insisted that she was VERY clear and would not budge-she killed our averages and took more than half credit off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	1	Sociology		5	2	3	1	613339	8/18/11	took intro to sociology online. was ridiculously easy. meet every guiline set down and you get a hundred. reference the reading. meet word requirement etc... take this online for an easy a
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology	210	3	2	2	2	613339	11/10/10	One word. "HORRIBLE" Do not take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology	449	5	4	3	4	613339	2/8/09	Truth is the class is EASY to get an A. Come to class and participate in the discussion. Then go home and read the book and take notes. Midterm and Final are OPEN BOOK! 1 homework per week, 2 short presentations. EASY STUFF FOLKS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology	101	5	1	3	4	613339	8/11/08	I couldn't stand her...honestly she was ridiculous, rude and flighty..find another professor,and if you have to have her class, don't take it in the AM, cause you won't stay awake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	0	Sociology		3	2	2	4	613339	2/1/08	i don't recommend this professor. She knows absolutely nothing about sociology, she's all over the place, and biased. the work isn't hard but the class is dull because she's so dumb.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology	201	3	4	3	2	613339	4/25/07	Professor is very friendly and upbeat. Class is not as simple as some students want to make it sound, exams were not difficult but classes were very interactive. Not much to say about this professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology		4	4	4	5	613339	3/8/06	For the above statements made. She was the best professor, she was easy and if you paid any attention in class you would have understood what to do. If you LISTEN in class you will easily get an A in that class. I highly recommend her as a teacher. If you talk and participate in class she will love you for ever. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Danielle Smith	2.8	2	Sociology		5	5	5	1	613339	2/8/06	she is the best i ever had. her classes are very interesting and she relates the topics to practical issues. her directions are straight to the point and she requires only 2 papers

Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	720	3	4	5	5	1136967	1/22/13	Great prof, really cool project ($10 Business Challenge), and very good at getting the best from his students. However, he grades inconsistently. Several peers and I made the same mistake on a project, only I lost points for it. Evidently he 'expected more from me.' Besides that, he's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	230	4	5	5	2	1136967	1/18/12	I loved him as a professor. He really encourages group discussion and jokes around alot. He really wants you to understand the material. You can argue back points on online quizzes. I thought his tests were pretty easy, but alot of people had trouble with it. He uses real life examples that make it easier to grasp the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	2	5	5	5	1136967	3/14/11	If your attending college to learn, and better yourself take this teacher his are difficult but he pushes you, and one of the few teachers that actually care that you learn and understand his subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	3	4	4	3	1136967	10/21/10	One of the best professors I've ever had. This course would be bland if it were taught by someone else. Class discussions are exciting, even for 8 AM, and the topics are relatable to every day life. Exams are NOT easy, so it's advisable to attend class. He will tell you that statistically students don't do well on the first exam. It's TRUE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business		1	1	3	3	1136967	4/22/10	I was not impressed with his class teaching. I didn't understand what exactly he expected on his essay-format exams. I asked him for help outside the classroom but he didn't help me at all. I was quite disappointed in him. He doesn't seem to care about his students as much as he does about his own business.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	101	3	4	5	5	1136967	3/11/10	GREAT professor! Ties in his real-world activities/experiences with lecture material. Interesting to listen to and speak with. GREAT take-aways! Attendance is optional, but you should go if you want to do well on exams. No required textbook. Very practical and fair. RIT could use more professors like Dr. Smith!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	101	3	5	5	5	1136967	3/1/10	Class isn't mandatory but if you want any chance of doing well in class you must go. Tests are esay format and you and you must be able to apply the information you learn in class. If you pay attention he makes hits about the information that will be on the test so you'll know what to study. The test format ensures you actually know the information
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	2	4	4	4	1136967	2/12/10	Makes the class interesting and enjoyable. Projects/games in class are kinda fun and you get bonus points for coming out on top. Only uses the text for weekly quizzes, which are straight from the book, word-for-word. Not the easiest exams unless you really study, but you'll get a lot from the lectures regardless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	400	1	5	5	4	1136967	11/3/09	Knows his stuff. Not interested n coddling "You pay close to $40,000 to be here so I better give you something". Constantly looks for ways to bring the dry material to life. Down to earth approach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business		5	5	4	2	1136967	7/8/09	I had him for both organizational behavior and leadership in orgs and he is great. Just study exactly what he tells you to and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	1	Business	230	2	3	2	5	1136967	3/4/12	Great individual, with a good sense of humor. Not very knowledgable, can be unclear at times and contradict himself in class. Will negotiate quiz questions that the class gets wrong. Exams are very difficult, study hard and pay attention in class-he gives hints. Very strict and demands respect which is annoying. Overall, ok
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business		2	4	4	4	1136967	3/16/11	I never officially had him in a class, however he has stepped in on my highschool class. and i found he is very helpful. he is tough however he took the time to explain about his business and how we can better ourselves to make a successful business venture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business		2	3	4	2	1136967	11/17/10	He make you learn his stuff real good, or you wont pass the class. Usually 85% of students fail the first test, because students don't know what to expect on those essay exams, which are often confusing and tricky. I am usually an A student, but in his class I would be happy to get a C. I am so glad this quarter is over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	101	5	5	4	5	1136967	8/27/10	Just read the slides and focus on what he emphasizes on them and you should do well on his essay style exams which have like 8 questions and you get to choose like 6. He also grades real easily on projects, quizzes are open book, open partner online, and there's lots of extra credit so its pretty easy to get an A if you play your cards right.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business	320	2	1	3	1	1136967	4/20/10	Needs to realize that not everybody is as obsessed with the subject as he is. Doesn't always come off as genuine in lectures. Sets very high standards considering the course material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	101	3	4	5	2	1136967	3/1/10	Great teachers, a four hour night class flys by. He hints at test questions, you don't have to go to class but should if you want an A. Everyone does well on projects, and he is really nice, fuunny and super cute!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	4	5	5	5	1136967	2/19/10	If you do everything he tells you to, expect to get a A. He gives essay questions, but as long as you study what he specifically tells you to study on the slides, you shouldnt have a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business	320	1	1	2	1	1136967	1/14/10	He's horrible instructor be away from his courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	4	4	5	3	1136967	10/21/09	Great teacher. I have him at 8am and he manages to keep me awake and interested. He knows his material and presents it well. I recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	350	2	5	4	1	1136967	6/5/09	We loved Professor Smith but we like to call him Dell. He was amazing. He was our world. He allowed us to grow not only academically but also individually. We are ever greatful to him. Thank You so much Professor Smith. And not to mention, I never had difficulty paying attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	2	5	5	4	1136967	5/29/09	I don't care what anyone else said! He's a great professor. Yes, the tests are hard, but I really learned a lot because I had to study so much for them. He gives out a looottt of bonus points, so participate and you will do well. Don't miss class, and take good notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business		5	5	5	1	1136967	4/21/09	Despite the reviews, D. Smith is a great professor. A lot of students in the class did have trouble with the tests...but he GAVE the test questions for each test. At the end of the quarter I had about 107. He gives LOTS of bonus points. I got 100 on 3/4 tests and got a 93 on the third. Go to class, take notes, and you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	2	5	4	3	1136967	11/25/08	Great teacher. Really cared that students learn the subject. Very encouraging of discussion and opinions. Tests are very hard though...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business	320	1	1	1	2	1136967	9/21/08	Horrible teacher. Worst exam I have ever taken. Exams consist of nine essay questions. Grades extremely harsh. Class average is currently a 66%. I have been an A student for the last 3 years, until I had this guy. Constantly brags about students complaining about him and shows disrespect for RIT. WORST TEACHER I have ever had! Avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business	320	1	1	1	1	1136967	6/1/08	horrible teacher who doesn't know how to teach at all. He grades his tests extremely unfair, and never listen to students' complains. "I am the expert right here you know."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	1	Business		2	2	4	4	1136967	5/11/09	Exams are all essay, but they only relate to small portions of what he talks about in class or what's in the book. He won't tell you much before an exam and then expects you to know so much about EVERY CONCEPT that you could write an essay on it. He grades extremely unfairly!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	0	Business	460	1	1	1	1	1136967	2/2/09	The grades on his exams are not about what you know but how your word it. Not a fair assessment and very objective. I am an A student but am lucky to get a C in his class. Seems like a nice guy in class but very unapproachable outside of class. Makes you feel like you're rushing him and he doesn't seem interested in what you have to say. Avoid him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	2	Business	320	5	5	5	4	1136967	10/21/08	Class had the mandatory boring parts, but Dr Smith tried to make it less so with activities. Tests were easy, but I usually study for a couple of hours. It also helps to have good exam skills: ANSWER WHAT THE QUESTION IS ASKING FOR. To try it out, I flat out didn't study for the final, and got a 50% (needed 36% for an A).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	1	Business	320	2	2	3	3	1136967	8/6/08	This is a class where the teacher grades an exam base on what he is looking for. If you are not good with written exams, then don't take the class. The teacher claim that this was the easiest class to take, but when if u take the class online, u would have a better chance of passing the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Delmonize Smith	3.7	1	Business	320	3	3	3	3	1136967	5/14/08	He tries his best to be fair and he takes constructive criticism well. It seems like he still has to learn how to teach and be consistent.,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shannon Smith	4.4	2	Psychology	101	4	5	5	3	1437821	1/30/13	Shannon was a terrific instructor and I would totally recommend her. I wish all psychology professors were this clear and friendly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shannon Smith	4.4	2	Psychology		4	4	4	1	1437821	1/17/11	Talks too much. Her voice is a tad annoying, but she is an easy teacher with only 3 assignments and 3 test.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shannon Smith	4.4	2	Psychology		3	4	4	4	1437821	11/9/11	Shannon was great. She was quirky and obviously excited about what she was teaching. She made me really enjoy the class, and now it is my concentration. If you're interested in Psych and you can take her, do it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shannon Smith	4.4	2	Psychology	210	4	4	5	1	1437821	10/10/10	Show up, Pay attention, Take notes, You'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Smith	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	5	5	1574488	5/15/12	Good professor, power points with fill in the blanks. Funny guy, keeps you interested. If you follow his study guides and do discussions you will do well. Would take anything with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Smith	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	5	1574488	5/18/11	great teacher ever i had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Smith	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	3	1574488	7/23/11	Tony is a great professor. He has quite a lot of experience teaching in the field, and he knows how to deliver well. He grades fairly and really helps students to succeed. He's got an interesting sense of humor and often tries to make the class laugh -- it doesn't always work, but I found him very amusing. Reading is required, but not unreasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tony Smith	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	5	4	1574488	5/5/11	Amazing teacher, lots of fun. Keeps class interesting and explains material very well. Always open to help you if you need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	2	Writing		3	4	4	5	737609	11/22/06	We read out of our assigned books and discussed them in class. He does talk about the world and politics a little bit, its actually kind of fun to discuss that in class. Overall good teacher, two or three papers and thats your whole grade. We got oout of class early most of the time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	1	Writing		4	3	3	1	737609	11/17/05	Hippie artist painter guy. He hates technology and the entire world. I found him interesting only because I went to class high all the time. You decide.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	0	Writing	227	3	2	1	4	737609	10/26/05	All I wanted was a class that taught me to be a better writer. Seriously. Instead this guy stands up at the front of the class pushing his own agenda. Really, all he does is talk about what's wrong with our country, the rest of the world, and technology. Every day. Avoid his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	0	Writing		3	1	1	3	737609	11/17/05	Simply the worst professor I've EVER had. All he did was rant about how terrible his life was and taught me absolutly nothing. DO NOT TAKE HIM! You'll regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	2	Writing		5	5	5	2	737609	11/9/05	One of my favorite writing teachers. He is fun, interesting, actually makes me want to go to writing class. He also is pretty easy. Only had a couple papers, and I actually did well on them even though I have never been the best writer. Fun teacher all around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tim Snyder	2.6	0	Writing		3	1	1	4	737609	10/26/05	Easily the worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Spends the whole class ranting on what he thinks is wrong with the world. You don't learn anything about writing whatsoever, just how much he dislikes technology and hates the world. If at all possible get out of his course, trust me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	504	5	4	5	5	216173	3/4/13	The main point to be stressed regarding this professor is that you have to have an interest in the course material to have any success in the class. This is not a course to be taken as a random place filler, and is meant for those who enjoy reading and discussing literature. As long as you voice your OWN opinion, you'll do fine. Class is great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	1	English		2	3	2	2	216173	12/5/12	Had her for AE. There was...an overwhelming amount of reading that had to be done. This week, she assigned 50 pages to be done on Thursday (assignment given Tuesday). She can be incredibly rude if there's something you're doing she doesn't like. Regardless of intention or not. I wouldn't recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	1	English	319	3	3	3	3	216173	5/25/12	Great class, however it is a lot of reading and work. She allows you to resubmit essays for a better grade if you did not do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	282	1	3	4	5	216173	3/13/12	her classes are heavily discussion based with only a couple major assignments. do your readings! don't even try to pretend you did them because she will scan your soul & KNOW. she seems harsh but she's actually really kind & forgiving if you let her know what's going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	325	4	5	3	5	216173	2/1/12	Very interesting! Class is completely discussion based. Very thought provoking material. Don't take this class if you only read books with happy endings.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	400	3	5	5	5	216173	10/26/11	Dr. Sommers is incredibly kind and knowledgeable and her classes are engaging, interesting and rewarding. I've taken several and enjoyed each of them. The texts she teaches are always interesting and thought-provoking. She is extremely helpful and always offers the option to re-write essays for an improved grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	4	5	1	216173	11/5/10	Good writing seminar teacher. She starts off seeming like a hard teacher but she turns out pretty like-able and entertaining. She grades the first essay easy and then gets tougher from there, but she allows a complete grade replacement with revision.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		2	3	4	3	216173	4/22/10	Awesome teacher, grades pretty decent but you have to work for your grade. She isn't afraid to tell you if you are wrong. I would recommend her to anyone willing to put effort into a class. Shes very intelligent and worth taking
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	101	2	5	5	4	216173	5/20/09	Dr. Sommers is reliable, understanding, and knows a lot about what she teaches. It's a college course, so naturally there is a bit of work involved. Reading is required, but the stories she assigns are always enjoyable and the discussions in class are helpful, inspiring, and insightful. I've taken multiple courses with her, all worthwhile..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		2	4	5	4	216173	3/12/08	Great Professor. Have taken every single class she offers. If you want to be truly enlightened, take one of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	201	1	3	4	3	216173	1/18/13	Extremely strict but if you do your work then she is very nice and the class is very educating. I've really enjoyed reading books and the discussions in the classroom. Just show respect and do your work then you will do just fine in her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English	400	1	3	5	5	216173	11/15/12	Great teacher, really knows her stuff! hard class and hard grading, be ready to be involved and actually do the work. she hates slackers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	1	English	319	1	3	3	4	216173	4/30/12	She's a great professor! But her AE is a HEAVY-reading course which means you have to read five books! Also you HAVE to read them before she questions you! If you don't, she'll give you a quiz! She can be tough if you don't read!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		3	3	5	5	216173	2/29/12	Hard work is required, you must read, and actually think. She expects you to have your homework done, and be ready for class. She's tough around the edges, but do what you're told and use a lot of quotes in your essays and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		3	5	5	4	216173	10/29/11	Great engaging professor. She expects quite a bit of work and is a stickler if you don't do it, but the assignments are usually worthwhile and interesting. She grades fairly and gives good feedback. Definitely take a class with her if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		1	3	4	1	216173	11/24/10	Had her for writing seminar last quarter and was quite easy. She expects a lot and requires a lot of work but rewards you for it with the easiness of her grading. She is a great teacher to take if you are willing to work for a grade, but does not tolerate slackers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	0	English		1	1	2	3	216173	11/4/10	She has a disdain for freshman, she is not at all communicative. She gets mad when you ask a question so clarification rarely happens. Would not take a class with here again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		2	5	5	2	216173	11/29/09	awesome professor. Simply the best! she is very strict but makes you enjoy her class (event writing seminar)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	4	5	2	216173	11/16/08	Honors Arts of Expression: Censorship Experience was my favorite class fall quarter. Dr. Sommers encourages discussion, but doesn't force anyone to participate if they don't want to. The course involves reading two novels and writing a 5 page paper on each. She's very willing to help you with your essay if you want help. Take this course!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		2	4	4	4	216173	4/30/07	Fantastic teacher. Had her for AE: Censorship, and taking her again for Dangerous Texts. Grades pretty fairly, allows rewrites, and there were no tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		3	4	4	4	216173	11/28/06	Okay. so expect to do...mountainloads of reading. that said she is extremely intelligent in her field and also very moody. Elena also does sometimes pick favorites... lucky for me she was fond of me. expect to learn alot and do alot of work. shes tough. but her class is ultimately rewarding, despite staying up some nights just to catch up on readin
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	0	English		3	1	1	5	216173	5/29/06	STAY AWAY! One of the worst teachers on campus. Grades papers very unfairly and picks final grades out of her ass. Picks favorites through the quarter. Extremely moody. I suggests never taking this woman for any class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		5	5	5	3	216173	10/18/05	Awesome teacher, best writing teacher around as far as I know, get her if you can, just don't abuse her kind nature.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		3	5	5	3	216173	2/17/05	Absolutely fantastic. Enjoyed every minute of the class. She certainly knows her Nabokov.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	5	5	2	216173	10/24/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		2	4	5	3	216173	10/22/06	I had her for Honors Lit: Dangerous Texts. Learned more about communism than I ever cared to know in my life--and enjoyed it! She's very sweet and understanding, but you have to be willing to try hard. She doesn't accept laziness. Allows re-writes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	5	5	3	216173	1/24/06	Great teacher. Helpful and nice. Very easy time here. You do have to read alot though. If you suck at reading, as in you are illiterate, maybe not the best but if you can atleast read maybe 10-20 pages a day you will sail through this class. No tests, few quizes and essays are hard to mess up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	5	5	4	216173	5/17/05	no tests, but there are a couple of quizzes. there are two papers and the first one she lets you re-submit it for a higher grade and the second paper is a persuasive class. he lectures are very informative and you learn alot, but be prepared to do a lot of reading. she's very nice and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		3	4	3	4	216173	2/9/05	alot of homework, will let you do rewrites, interesting lectures,
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elena Sommers	4.0	2	English		4	4	4	NULL	216173	5/26/03	Organized. Helpful .Expects everyone to come to class on time ALWAYS. Easy grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	409	5	1	3	5	494830	2/3/13	One of the worst professors I have had here. Although he is a very intelligent person, he did not teach a single in the class. Php, javascript, jquery, ajax all the good stuff we were supposed to learn were basically outlined and he expects you to teach yourself how to do it. Would avoid if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	409	3	1	2	4	494830	1/21/12	He does not teach! Tells you what to use to make something happen but does not teach you how to do it. Requires a lot of reading and you have to teach yourself javascript ajax and anything else besides html. If not you will come out not having learned anything but a few tips. Class is 4 assignments. two are group projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	590	2	2	1	3	494830	11/9/11	Took a "Mobile Design" class with him. Expectations were not clearly set in the beginning of the quarter. He assumes that entire class is full of high level programmers though the only pre-req to the class is IMM. Not a terrible guy, very friendly, but the classwork was unrealistic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	409	4	1	2	5	494830	12/20/10	I took a website design and implementation class with this guy and it turns out he doesn't know what he is doing. His course syllabus was basically a set of links that he clicked through and read maybe the first few sentences of each. He is also supposed to teach about site usability, and his own site is terrible. No teach by example here!GoodLuck!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	320	2	1	2	4	494830	2/18/10	His classes are very easy and are 100% outlined at the beginning of the quarter but he is pretty bad at answering questions. Nice guy, smart, not so good at teaching. Also too much of a smart ass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	320	4	1	2	3	494830	2/5/09	He is a very *expletive deleted* bad professor. He is more concerned with his twitter page and these web conferences than the students work, so nothing gets graded until the end of the quarter. Makes a difference excuse everyday as to why there are no grades yet. You'll have to teach yourself most of the stuff for this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science	320	5	2	3	4	494830	3/12/08	IMM is incredibly easy so that wasn't an issue, but didn't really learn much from him. He is more interested in the handheld web and his days of the west coast. He's a pretty good time in class, but expect to teach yourself just about everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	409	4	1	2	5	494830	10/22/07	Jeff does not know what he's talking about. He knows a lot about the web, but he doesn't know how industry standards. It's annoying because he'll pretend he knows what he's talking about. He'll look up things he doesn't know on google, and then read straight from them. His projects are so dumb.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	2	Computer Science		4	3	4	4	494830	11/28/05	If you're good with this kind of stuff or good at figuring stuff out you'll do fine. Just do the 3 projects, midterm and final and you'll have at least a B. He doesn't teach all the details-- a lot of the stuff you figure out on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science		5	3	3	5	494830	1/11/05	I'm glad I'm not the only one who gets the pirate vibe... Although the class is ridiculously easy, he goes on too long about the same stuff. If it wasn't such an easy GPA boost, I would have tested out long ago...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	409	2	1	3	4	494830	3/1/12	Does not respond to emails. Did not learn HOW to do anything. Just looked at snippets of code and learned how to critique a website. Expects you to read outdated websites and I guess teach yourself javascript, php, ajax, jquery and such because he does not show you how.I'd avoid at all costs in the future.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	2	Computer Science	409	5	4	4	5	494830	12/4/11	The course has a steadily climbing workload, so don't leave everything till the last second just because you can. He focuses on usability in lecture and on the projects, but will expect you to learn a basic level of javascript and php during the course. He placed a lot of focus on why you should do something in a certain way instead of how to do it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science		5	3	3	4	494830	9/12/11	I got an A in this class it was so easy. He is a very intelligent teacher but not very helpful outside of class. I had a friend that knew alot about web so it made it easier. The Midterm and Final are pretty much the same. You can get an A if you pay attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	3	2	494830	10/25/10	Prof honestly does not concern himself with students. Does not want to see them save for his personal enjoyment (told this to freshmen). Grades on the side of the student is always wrong and does not admit fault when he is. Students will have to teach themselves HTML because he never goes over it in class (expects students to know it w/o telling).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	1	494830	2/16/10	He is the worst teacher ever and such a hypocrite because he'll say that its fine if you don't understand, because thats why you're taking the class... to learn. Then he gets mad when you don't understand what to do. Not flexible at all and refuses to help... always tries to tell you to just get the labbie to help you or the TA
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science	409	4	3	2	1	494830	11/5/08	Looks like a disgruntled mall store santa. Funny guy, nice guy, poor professor. I um...haven't learned a thing. Whee!He gives you a lot of mandatory readings and then wants you to ask him questions about what you didn't understand. That's about it. He had a grad student teach for a week and we learned more from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	320	4	2	2	4	494830	2/20/08	I'll put it this way: i took IMM and really liked him - he's a fun guy, and it was an easy A. So I took him for 409 and realized something (when asked by a friend); I didn't really learn anything in his class. I mean sure, I learned a little bit, but most of what i learned was from online tutorials. (just see his outline for proof)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science	320	5	1	1	5	494830	12/5/06	This class is incredibly easy. However, this professor is very uncompromising. I was absent for several class periods since I'm on an athletic team, but he would not let me make up the projects. Instead of getting an A as I deserved from my 98.8% on the final, I ended up retaking the class since I got a D. (I got an 87% on the midterm.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	4	494830	11/7/05	Although I get the good grade but it only because I know what I'm doing on the exercise that he assigned. However, the stuff that I expected to learn, such as photoshop, animation. I never learned it bcuz he never teach that to us. I was disappointed. Well, he easy if you know what you doing, if not, you need to spend time to read the text book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	2	494830	12/26/04	he's helpful to those who know what theyre doing but to those who dont, avoid him at all costs. he simply tells you what he wants you to do then expects you to do it with very little of his help. we didn't even learn half as much as every other IMM class did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	4	494830	11/28/04	Jeff knows EVERYTHING about the computer development over the years because he lived through it all. IMM is an easy class, and if you have trouble passing it, you're a moron. Jeff also has the most maniacal laugh ever, you've got to hear it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Sonstein	2.2	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	3	494830	11/11/04	He reminds me of a pirate. Sometimes I expect him to walk in with a parrot on his shoulder and eyepatch over his eye and be all like "ARRRRRRR, mateys". Anyway, I personally didn't really like him all that much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	2	Social Science		5	4	4	3	1142687	3/8/12	I had this professor for Intro to Environmental Studies. He does have a bit of a monotone and goes into random tangents about certain topics, but he's a genuinely nice guy. The online weekly quizzes are easy if you pay attention in class and have the book with you. His papers are kind of a pain but he grades fairly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	0	Social Science	305	4	2	2	1	1142687	10/11/11	Intro to Enviro Studies. Easy Class, material and method of teaching is kind of boring, online quizzes every week are easy, the four decent sized papers(3 to 5 pages) are probably the most annoying? Not per say difficult though. He tends to go off on tangents, and those tend to be more interesting than the actual class material, an Easy A/B class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	0	Social Science	211	5	1	2	3	1142687	10/30/09	one of the most boring profs I've ever had. He's nearly monotone and basically babbles on about values for the entire class. He gave a lot of assignments but if you do them every week they arnt too bad. Sci and Tech Values is a pretty easy class though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	1	Social Science		4	3	3	1	1142687	11/11/11	Decent teacher. You can play on your laptop, just do the papers, quizzes, and reviews before the tests and you should get an easy A (or A+ depending on the grading schema).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	2	Social Science		3	4	4	2	1142687	3/8/11	Very monotone and boring will help you though if you appear to be trying. Do the quizzes...theyll save your grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Spacher	2.8	1	Social Science	211	4	2	3	1	1142687	10/30/08	Most boring teacher ever. Dull class with no exciting topics ever. Not too bad on grading though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Malcolm Spaull	2.0	1	Film		3	3	3	2	1146812	9/6/08	Pretty straightforward in what he expected and as long as you show up and try you'll do OK.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Malcolm Spaull	2.0	0	Film	101	5	1	1	2	1146812	7/10/08	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Sposato	5.0	2	History	469	5	5	5	4	1697172	3/1/12	Awesome professor. Made sure everyone understood materials. Showed a Knight's Tale and Kingdom of Heaven and A Lion in Winter. Super passionate about what he teaches and he's good looking. Not a lot of work at all. Midterm and final are open notes and the only other requirement is a book discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack/john Spula	3.7	2	Writing		4	4	4	4	810153	7/13/10	Essay topics were not boring; they were related to current and important events ex. Haiti earthquake, President Obama's speech about Afghanistan. I enjoyed the class because it was low-maintenance class and interesting topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack/john Spula	3.7	1	Writing		5	3	2	1	810153	3/9/09	Class is incredibly boring. He doesn't seem to care much about class he just takes his time talking about w/e he feels is relevant. Doesn't really teach you anything you don't already know. Grades easy, assignments aren't very difficult either. If you don't care about learning anything take him, if you want to improve your skills look elsewhere.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack/john Spula	3.7	2	Writing		4	4	4	3	810153	2/11/06	this guy is a hippie.class is boring, bring a laptop.he takes attendance, but the syllabus says nothing about attendance.u get a 10-15 min. break halfway through, if u dont return, he ususally doesnt notice.4 essays total, approx700 wrds each.the topics are pretty easy an EASY occasional in-class essay.u get out early a lot.very nice man.easy grade
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack/john Spula	3.7	2	Writing	227	5	4	4	3	810153	5/12/10	EASYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! Easiest class I have ever taken... you basically write 3 essay plus a "final in class essay" about 400 words (less than a page). No HW, only weekly reports about any topic you like in the news and email it to him (about 300 words)... If you just want an easy A or B take him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jack/john Spula	3.7	2	Writing		5	4	4	3	810153	5/16/06	VERY VERY EASY CLASS! 4 essays and then the final week you need to submit one by email. Class is real boring but just show up and throw in a comment here and there and you'll be set. He grades very easy so if you go to class and at least hand in your work on time you will set for this class. Easy Easy Easy!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marshall Smith	1.5	0	Social Science		5	1	2	5	15796	11/17/05	I felt like I was in therapy or some weird support group. He kept trying to get people to reveal their innermost thoughts and their was lots of crying. Never Again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marshall Smith	1.5	0	Social Science		1	1	1	NULL	15796	10/2/01	You will DIE in his class

Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	2	Chemistry		4	4	3	3	1020682	11/12/12	Class was relatively easy, he provides old exams, of which half the questions are copied word for word. Haven't learned anything, but not too hard to earn my A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry	213	1	1	1	1	1020682	11/1/11	You would be better off teaching yourself. He gives 5 bonus points for going to class but lectures are useless. His tests have nothing to do with what he teaches.And the essay questions are ridiculous. grading is inconsistent. it seems easy at first but tests are 90% of the grade and they are very difficult. but 75=B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry	232	1	1	2	1	1020682	1/26/10	He really is evil. This class is horrible bc Smith doesn't know how to teach. He is always 5 minutes late to class, and never answers question students ask in a straight manner. He called me stupid once, when I went to his office hours. NEVER again. I had a freaking 4.0 until I had to take his class!! Read the text. His lectures are useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry	231	2	1	1	3	1020682	11/12/09	Attendance isn't mandatory but might as well be due to extra credit. Never administers tests on time, usually 10 to 15 minutes late and wonders why students don't complete exams. Lectures are difficult to follow and never follow the syllabus. The only way to learn anything in this class is to talk to the TA's and to read text independently.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry	232	2	3	1	3	1020682	2/9/09	Organic is hard enough...dont take him. Nice guy but horribly hard to follow when he is teaching. Had to curve tests by 30 points and willing to give a D to students with 30%.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	1	Chemistry		2	2	3	3	1020682	1/26/09	I went to every class, I went to office hours, I had a private tutor, My dad is a chemist and gave me supplemental reading material, I did all homework assignments, I read the book cover-to-cover, I asked questions and reviewed every test and quiz with Dr. Smith, AND I had study partners... and you wanna know the result? A C+! WHAT?!?!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry	232	1	1	1	2	1020682	8/22/07	Worst teacher I have ever had at RIT. Might know a lot about the subject but definitely does not portray it to the class. Can NOT teach. Stick with Turner if you are thinking of dropping, he is much worse!!! Each test is formatted differently so in addition to memorizing the book/material/hw you have a different test each time. :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	2	Chemistry		3	4	4	4	1020682	10/24/12	The class isn't easy, but he is a really nice guy. He is really intelligent and sometimes has a hard time explaining things clearly, but not a bad teacher. The class wasn't too boring and getting an A was possible if you worked for it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	1	1020682	3/19/10	Worst professor I've had so far at RIT. Can't teach, makes the subject impossible to learn. After 2 quarters with him, all I've done was lower my GPA by getting 2 B's in his classes. DO NOT take him. If he's the only one teaching organic, WAIT for someone else!! You will be thankful. His lectures consist of him drawing random reactions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	0	Chemistry		1	1	2	2	1020682	11/16/09	CAN NOT TEACH. What he covers in lecture seems simple, but the test questions are WAY more difficult. Often takes the first 10 minutes of a 50 min lecture to set up, or 20 minutes to pass out a test, and wonders why people don't complete it. Assigns homework to topics that will be covered in future lectures. Incredibly frustrating. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	2	Chemistry	203	3	4	3	5	1020682	5/25/09	Dr. Thomas is a great guy, with that said organic is hard and his teaching style is so so, but there is so much to the subject that he did the best he could. Ive seen grades for other classes and he seems to get an avg of a B for his , The book is very helpful and is used constantly he may not get to everything he puts on a test,which is a problem
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	1	Chemistry		1	2	3	4	1020682	2/8/09	He is never on schedule with the syllabus but he expects you to read the chapters on you own time and he tests you on them even though he didn't lecture on them! Seems like he is totally clueless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Smith	2.3	2	Chemistry	701	3	5	5	3	1020682	10/21/07	Great Professor if you really want to learn stuff. easy accessible, and very knowledgeble, if you just want to earn the course credits, you might have a hard time. it is really a good course for some body who is interested
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice		2	4	5	3	1002290	7/17/09	While the material is all based on articles and court cases. This class requires quite a bit of reading. However, learned alot and there were no suprises. You knew what to expect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	507	5	4	5	5	1002290	8/31/08	Was warned numerous times this professor was extremely hard & should be avoided. My experience was the opposite. The class was Computer Crime, & I had no trouble. No textbook; only 2 papers & a presentation. As long as you can think critically & write at an actual college level, you should be fine. Doesn't post slides, but you shouldn't need them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	0	Criminal Justice	501	1	1	2	1	1002290	4/15/08	This woman should record her lectures and market them as the cure for insomnia...they are that dry and uninteresting. Entire grade based on 2 writing assignments, which she will rip apart and compare to the writings of a 6th grader. Rude and unapproachable, glad I'm not a criminal justice major!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	0	Criminal Justice	507	1	1	1	3	1002290	3/18/08	Very dry and hard to engage in her lectures. She chews people apart for writing assignments. Stay away. Not helpful if you don't do well. Refuses to answer questions after assignments are handed out!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice		2	5	4	5	1002290	3/4/08	Professor Smyth, is an excellent professor. There is alot to be learned from this professor. Willing to help students and loves to get you "thinking". If willing and work hard, you will exceed with any course taught by this professor.I highly recommend taking classes with ths professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice		4	5	4	4	1002290	2/21/08	Excellent. Learned a lot. Great power point slides. Very nice and willing to work with students.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	222	5	4	4	5	1002290	5/28/09	One of the best professors I have had and I've only been here one year. Her lectures are intresting and make me want to go to class and I asked tons of questions because they were intriquing. But she has a strict no papers in email policy, and be carful. she bases her whole grade on the three papers you write.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	405	4	4	4	3	1002290	4/30/08	So many people told me to stay away from her classes, but Crime & Drugs was great! She's not extremely exciting, but we watched a lot of shocking videos, and she is extremely intelligent. She is not a difficult grader either if you know how to write a college level paper. No final exam, either. Do not be afraid!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	405	2	5	4	5	1002290	3/4/08	Awesome jprofessor.Professor does present alot of informtion, however all of it is of interest and you will LEARN a tn of information. She is very willing to help students understand the material, will help with writing techniques and has interesting information t share. A must take classes from Professor, highly recommend you will be successful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	2	Criminal Justice	405	3	3	4	3	1002290	2/29/08	A little dry at times, but very straightforward. The class could have benefited from more lecture and less class discussion I thought. Minimal assignments outside of class: 2 large papers, 2 short papers, and reading a bunch of articles. Overall, I enjoyed the course and become more interested in the material as a result. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sara Smyth	3.2	0	Criminal Justice		2	2	2	2	1002290	2/11/08	sooooo boring, only states things from the book,very critical in essays, talks for 2 hours straight, the only thing she did that was nice was give me an extension on the final due to a family emergency, but other than, boring and threatened to fail me on something that had nothing to do with me.....avoid her classes
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Snyder	3.2	1	Photojournalism		1	3	3	4	1490186	1/24/13	Extremely knowledgeable; dry humored; strict; expects professional quality work; some think he's mean, he's just REALISTIC
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Snyder	3.2	2	Photojournalism		1	3	4	4	1490186	11/1/10	Pretty a good professor...he's pretty tough on his students though. He pushes his students to get out of their shell. If you don't get out of your shell, you will get a low grade. He has his own strong opinions. Just keep in mind that he is a good professor but very difficult to satisfy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Frank Solome	3.5	2	Athletics		5	3	4	5	963354	3/6/07	Current coach for the Varsity teams. not as good as the previous coach Nealon tho. very encouraging and insightful as to what your weaknesses are, but doesn't really forcefully help you change them. Nealon would position your body the right way and go through the motion with you, but Frank mostly only points out what you did wrong... Good guy tho.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Qian Song	2.5	2	Accounting	101	3	4	4	3	1690682	2/22/12	She is pretty good teacher considering the fact she just started teaching a while ago. She can really help you get an A if you just pay attention all the time. She is definitely fair grader. the more you pay attention, the more help you'll receive.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Qian Song	2.5	0	Accounting	302	2	1	1	2	1690682	2/16/12	VERY dfficult to understand. Terrible handwriting and organization when showing problems. Does not post ppt. slides ahead of time and uses them for class. Uses connect for homework which is irrelevant to her mult. chc. and problem based tests. Ambiguous, in-class problems covering multiple concepts before mastering key concept. STAY AWAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	1	Information Technology		3	3	3	4	1113577	3/13/13	Nice guy, addicted to his cat which is sweet but believes in readying students for the corporate world in the sense he says he has no trouble with students taking complete projects off the web and submitting them as their own.So if you like to google search and don't want to learn..he's your guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	0	Information Technology	101	4	1	2	1	1113577	1/28/10	This guy doesn't know what he's talking about- be it C++ or anything. He's an elitist and is terrible at teaching, and ignorant. Worst of all, he brings his conservative politics into the classroom! That said, the class is really easy. It's a freshman level class with some basic arithmetic which he goes over very slowly. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	0	Information Technology		3	1	1	3	1113577	2/2/09	Boring teacher, their was no point in going to class, lectures were long and boring, and you are much better off going to tutors to learn the material than going to class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	1	Information Technology		4	2	4	3	1113577	5/10/08	Terrible at teaching C++. TA was much better at helping in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	2	Information Technology	208	3	5	4	5	1113577	2/9/10	I like the guy. he is always in a good mood. he has to deal with a lot of cocky students with previous experience. I never had any programming experience before this class, so I found his help invaluable. he never had trouble answering questions in class or assisting me in lab. I highly recommend him. The text book was great too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	1	Information Technology	101	4	3	3	4	1113577	2/25/09	The class was pretty easy and he did an alright job teaching it, but I wouldn't take an upper-level class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel Sorrentino	2.6	0	Information Technology		3	2	2	1	1113577	1/27/09	Terrible at teaching C++. Doesn't give you a straight answer when you ask for help. One day we had a sub when he was out sick and he turned out to be better help and makes sure we understand the topic. I wouldn't take him again as a programming teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Sparnecht	4.4	2	History		3	5	5	3	494839	2/25/05	Very nice guy. He made class interesting and always had stories that were interesting and related to his lecture. Forgetful some times, but it was no big deal. He teaches you what it is to be an American and helps you think about different current events. One of the best teachers I have had so far.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Sparnecht	4.4	2	History		4	5	4	2	494839	11/20/04	Mr.Sparnect, really has an enthusiasm for life and history and makes your learning of history fun. He is one of the most caring and thoughtful teachers I have ever had. He was a bit disorganized, however that was only because this was his first semester teaching college and he is only an adjunct.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Sparnecht	4.4	2	History		3	4	5	5	494839	1/11/05	Super nice and has great stories which always have some relevence. He is one of the single best teachers I have ever had. He can be forgetful at times, but it doesn't cause problems. If you like history even a bit, Prof Spar is your man. On that note, I'm a history major pratly because of him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Sparnecht	4.4	2	History		3	3	4	1	494839	11/11/04	He thinks history (and himself) is the best thing since sliced bread. I personally hated the class...never ever take a 4 hour history class if you don't like history in the first place. He's very forgetful too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Sprinz	2.0	0	Mathematics		2	3	1	2	632651	6/14/05	First off he's an adjunct. All the material should have been easy but his test-creating and grading system are not at all uniform. I struggled all through the course, along with the rest of the class-20% were failing he tried to be helpful but things just did not make sense. The book was even less help, the design is useless and confusing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ron Stappenbeck	1.5	0	Information Technology		1	1	2	3	748480	11/6/05	Lectures are vague, and he is rarely available and very unhelpful. He assigns many hours of busywork with unreasonable time expectations. He seems to think that his class is the only class you have and that all of your time must be devoted to it. Avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	0	Humanities	411	4	1	1	1	162755	4/7/10	The whole class was based around a large group meeting. He was never on time and barely knew what we were working on. He would yell at us at the beginning of class because we were waiting for him to teach us something but all he said was look it up in your book. Some teachers need to be reviewed, most aren't doing their jobs...teaching!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities	508	4	4	3	3	162755	1/30/09	He is a decent teacher and a great guy. He makes beer drinking fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities	250	2	5	5	4	162755	10/31/07	The most intuitive and to the point teacher when it comes to negotiations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities		3	5	5	NULL	162755	5/8/04	Great professor. Always willing to help you out esp. with topics you have questions about. He's a great advocate and user of different learning styles and lectures are rarely dull.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	0	Humanities		2	2	2	NULL	162755	4/3/03	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities	410	4	3	4	4	162755	3/9/10	Took Meeting and Exposition Mgmt course. The class was entirely based off of a group project which we dragged out the whole quarter. Steffens is very unorganized for an events planner and always late for class. Not as great of a course as it could have been due to his poor teaching skills.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities	101	2	5	5	5	162755	10/31/07	One of the best professors I ever had!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities	420	5	5	5	4	162755	10/26/07	Steffens is awesome...his lectures are entertaining..i actually looked foward to going to class! He doesn't take attendence but a lot of whats on the test is material he talked about during class. its worth it to go to class.....definately take him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities		3	5	5	NULL	162755	6/24/03	Prof. Steffens is a very in depth professor. He is very energetic, and excited about what he does. His courses are very thourough, and you walk away with a wealth of knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ed Steffens	4.0	2	Humanities		2	5	5	NULL	162755	3/9/03	Beers of the world, wines of the world. Ed is a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		4	4	5	2	267020	1/31/07	Dr. Stelle is a very intelligent woman. She happily and directly answers questions that aren't even on topic. She is very accomodating when you need help, and the tests aren't bad if you study right from her notes (which she usually provides for you) All in all, I highly reccomend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		3	5	4	4	267020	10/21/06	Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		3	4	4	3	267020	11/20/05	Good teacher, worked very well with students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		4	5	5	NULL	267020	5/15/04	Puts slides online and knows her stuff! Very fair grader, great teacher!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		4	5	5	NULL	267020	3/7/04	Be prepared to attend lectures, most lectures are on the exams and gives you a good chance of earning good marks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		5	5	5	5	267020	10/26/06	she is the best professor ever. Her lectures are straight to the point..Her exams are easy and her grading system is excellent btw she is really beautiful...best teacher at rit!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		3	5	5	4	267020	2/20/06	Very clear, very organized, very helpful, nice person. She truly seems to enjoy her career.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology	300	2	5	5	5	267020	2/3/05	My favorite teacher at RIT. Funny, likes to get to know the students, and very challenging. She's a tough grader but all it means is that you work harder. Like I said- my favorite teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		3	5	5	NULL	267020	5/10/04	She is by far the most beautiful, brilliant lady who has taught me thus far. Clear, concise and to the point, sign me up for this class again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Lani Stelle	4.8	2	Biology		3	5	5	NULL	267020	10/23/03	I have not had a better professor at RIT. Lei Lani certainly sets the bar on how to teach classes. Her explainations are excellent and she is writes fair exams. She is brilliant, always having an answer for any question thrown at her. I'm in awe.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Enid Stevenson	3.3	2	Writing		4	5	5	4	706119	2/13/07	Very easy, lets you choose your own topic for the papers, says theres five papers in the quarter but only wrote 4 so far, very friendly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Enid Stevenson	3.3	0	Writing		3	2	1	1	706119	9/22/05	Dear god. If you EVER get assigned to this class, get out. It is taught at a remedial level, and by remedial, I mean extremely remedial. If you did decently in high school writing and English classes, this course with Stevenson is an insult to your intelligence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Enid Stevenson	3.3	2	Writing		4	3	4	1	706119	11/2/05	If you slacked off in high school, don't worry! Use what you know from middle school and you'll do fine. There isn't anything new taught. Pretty much the only thing you have to worry about is her changing the assignments on you. Sometimes she'll e-mail you to change her mind. She's a nice lady, but her class sucks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Stewart	4.5	2	Communication		4	4	5	4	1543221	8/1/11	Great professor. Great class. Earned a B. Make sure you read your text book. It's you greatest ally in the course!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Stewart	4.5	2	Communication		2	4	5	3	1543221	7/20/11	Helpful but very picky. Good class I learned a lot
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	1	Literature		1	3	3	1	89709	12/19/12	Taking Evolving English Language with him now. He's a super nice guy, but this class is extremely challenging and he talks NON- STOP. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you absolutely have to take it. Do an online class with him instead. I got an A with him for "witten argument" and did the bare minimum of work. Pice of cake IMO.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		2	1	3	1	89709	8/18/11	took this online. do not take this online with him. he is a hardass. you have no late date for submission. you have no way to know how you stand because he only gives you your grade on major assignments. not a good teacher online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		4	2	2	2	89709	4/5/11	Dr. Stone is a very nice guy. He gives many silly assignments, like discussion posts. But he is a very easy essay grader, and as long as you do the discussions online, and write a semi-decent essay USING QUOTES from the novel you'll probably get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature	201	4	4	3	3	89709	11/28/10	This class was a bit pointless, but Tom clearly has a love for teaching. I think he has molded the class to his liking and is trying to do the same with our minds, although I found on essays he was very willing to accept new ideas and grade them fairly. FOR A REQUIRED CLASS THIS CLASS COULD BE MUCH WORSE. Just don't expect to stay awake in lectures
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature	210	2	2	2	3	89709	5/24/10	Class was extremely boring and pointless. Went off topic a lot about his arts of expression class he teaches. Not sure if I actually learned anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	1	Literature	319	3	3	3	4	89709	7/21/09	I was interested in the class because it focused around storytelling, but the ancient texts were not fun for me. It was an okay class, although lectures were often a little dry/boring. The grading was easy--a couple quizzes and two essays. The final was online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	1	Literature	227	3	1	5	3	89709	4/27/09	Though the classes could be dry at times, he kept it fairly interesting. Extremely easy to get along with, and will gladly help you during his office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature	400	4	1	1	1	89709	3/4/09	DO NOT TAKE Arts of Expression: storytelling online. Terrible class, tons of mind numbing reading, completely worthless class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		3	1	2	5	89709	4/12/07	pompous and uncommunicative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature		4	5	3	2	89709	8/23/06	Most days for this class I left during the break and never came back. I handed in almost every assignment late... I got an A... need I say more?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature	227	2	1	2	3	89709	11/17/11	Writing Seminar
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		1	1	1	4	89709	5/6/11	Professor was nonexistent in the online section and rude when he did contribute. Content was completely off topic and very lengthy. Communication was terrible. I do NOT recommend this class. Very disappointing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature	101	4	4	3	4	89709	3/1/11	He is a nice guy. I think the reason for his low ratings is that he definitely does tend to go off subject a LOT. He know so much about the topic that his mind is constantly trying to spit everything out at us, so it comes off as very confusing at times. Otherwise, it is an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	1	Literature	210	4	4	2	2	89709	10/1/10	He is very enthusiastic and a really great guy. However, his classes are somewhat pointless. He sometimes gets off topic, or tries to relate something seemingly random to what is being discussed. He gives a bit of work but not too much to handle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	1	Literature	210	4	3	2	4	89709	5/5/10	If there could be a more useless class I don't know it. He babbles on about w/e in lecture, general unrelated to the text he's supposed to be going over. He's apparently not very bright, as he tries to get class participation, and no one wants to talk anymore because that means another half hour of BS about nothing. The books are hard reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature	210	4	2	2	1	89709	4/29/09	didn't go to class, didn't do the readings, pulled the essays out of my head and got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		2	1	2	3	89709	3/18/09	His way of grading was based not off of a letter or numerical grade but with fair or good. After 6 weeks and only 1 assignment from week 1 was graded.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		3	1	1	1	89709	1/21/09	He can talk for HOURS. Doesn't say an interesting word. Thinks he's very funny. Goes off every lecture and if clearance on assignments are expected don't take him. Don't recommend him AT ALL!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature	325	3	1	1	1	89709	10/18/06	the guy just wont stop talking. i can't remember one class where i didn't go out of mind mind listening to him speak. he can talk for a half hour and not say a word. also only allows a few students to talk and any original ideas are shot down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		4	2	1	2	89709	5/3/06	Rambles on and on. Classes are very boring, but he typically leaves early. He's a pretty easy grader, though, and gives some good one-on-one help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	0	Literature		2	2	1	5	89709	2/9/06	He lectures on and on and maybe will mention one person or idea once but expects you to retain enough information to right a long answer about it on a test. He also goes off on too many tangents.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature		5	3	4	1	89709	1/20/05	Can get very boring in class, but is an easy class to take, cancels assignments and such.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature		4	4	4	3	89709	7/7/05	Tom was pretty good. He gave extentions when needed, didnt give too much work and cared about the students. I would reccomend him to you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Stone	2.3	2	Literature		3	4	4	NULL	89709	11/30/02	Goes on funny tangents, promotes class discussion, makes req lit classes okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		3	5	5	2	424248	3/6/12	My interest going into the class was extremely low. John was able to inspire me to want to learn more, and more about finance. His teaching style is all about involving the students, he will not move on until the students are comfortable with the material. Granted, the class was not a cake walk, but it is very possible to receive an A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		2	4	5	3	424248	8/10/09	Very interesting lecturer. Combines theory and current events with a sense of humor. Class time flew by and was never boring. Will definitely take other classes from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		2	5	5	4	424248	6/6/05	Great course with team and individuals projects and papers. He's a real interesting speaker using current events. I learned alot in this class. Would recommend him to everyone for any econ or finance classes he teaches.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		2	5	4	4	424248	4/15/10	Professor Striebich is awesome. He is really helpful and outlines the problems clearly before tests. Tests are open notes, but they are not cake walks. If you do the hw problems and practice then they aren't bad. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you expect to do good you must attend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		2	4	5	4	424248	10/27/05	I never liked my economics courses at my undergrad college. He brings in articles and current events to make economics interesting. I've learned a lot and see how economics can be used in business. Will definitely take other courses with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Striebich	4.8	2	Business		3	5	5	NULL	424248	6/16/04	Such a good class. He really makes you understand the material. Alot of HW that is pretty hard, but all the test are open book and it helps you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cynthia Strong	3.5	2	Information Technology	221	5	3	4	5	1182981	10/14/08	Cindy is a grad student pretty much babysitting an entry level lab course. She is constantly confused by error messages, so go look em up on ur own. Easy A for Cyber lab
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	4	127294	2/12/13	Very capable at explaining code and more than willing to provide help on labs and tests. This class was very easy, but kept me interested and I feel like I learned a lot. Plus you might get Eitan as TA and he's super awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	241	5	4	4	4	127294	11/14/12	Strout's an awesome guy. Fair with deadlines and clear with material that will be covered in tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	127294	5/17/12	Strout is awesome, this review is not about him, but about CG1. Computer Graphics is a hard topic to begin with, make sure you really want to do it before you take the class. That being said, Strout teaches it like a boss, and of course he answers any questions you have. Lectures are hilarious.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	242	4	5	5	3	127294	3/6/12	It all made so much sense! Strout is an excellent professor, and his lectures were easy to pay attention to and learn from. Data Structures was surprisingly my favorite class when I took it. I really understood the concepts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	127294	2/28/12	It's really ludicrous how excellent this professor is. You could sleep through a lecture and still understand the information presented. He is extremely concerned with his students success and works to make sure they succeed. This excellent man is truly a teacher (in every sense of the word) instead of just another professor. Great guy too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	242	4	5	5	5	127294	2/2/12	VERY good professor, humorous and clear explanations. Keeps lectures fun unlike other professors. Despite all this, he might be a good professor but the class is hard if you put no effort into it unless you have good CS background.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	241	4	5	5	4	127294	11/9/11	He's a very funny and interesting teacher. He also encourages participation and is very approachable. The class is never dull and you learn a lot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	334	4	5	5	5	127294	10/8/11	Has rare talent of being able to teach a lot of material in a short period of time, with crystal clarity, zero ambiguity or confusion, and leaving the students perfectly understanding of the material. Does live coding every day to demonstrate concepts learned. Very nice, and funny when appropriate. Hardest tests in department, yet highest scores.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	334	4	5	5	5	127294	1/27/11	One of the best teachers in the CS department! Very helpful and accessible (and entertaining).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	241	4	5	5	5	127294	11/7/10	Absolutely the best professor in the entire CS department. Lectures are fun, relaxed, and informative. He's extremely helpful outside class, and willing to help you at every step. Really laid back: One day he came in with no shoes, and when asked about it, he replied "They're in my office." Great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	5	127294	11/19/12	I took him for my Problem Solving in Computer Science major. He is an excellent professor. He definitely have made my experience in that class enjoyable. He is fair on giving work to the students. Homework and Lab every week. Exams are challenging but Strout is an easy grader. But I don't like his TAs when they grade our homework and lab works.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	241	4	5	5	5	127294	11/12/12	Strout is a great professor. He explained things very well and his assignments were very clear. I had no problems with his class or with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	242	4	5	5	4	127294	3/29/12	Excellent professor. I agree with all of the great things other people have said below me about him. He really makes difficult topics understandable. Only complaint is sometimes he can get a little off topic in class and we won't finish a lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	4	127294	3/4/12	This guy understands that he's not teaching the easiest topic in the world, despite it being his area of expertise, and he makes a real effort to get you to understand it on reasonable (rather than ideal) terms. You won't be sorry you took CS4 with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	242	5	5	5	5	127294	2/27/12	Strout is an awesome teacher! its like learning from a hilarious uncle, that really knows his stuff. He is super friendly and willing to help you if you ask. He will sit and scan through lines of code with you to help fix labs/hwk (most other professors wont do that.) Easily my favorite professor at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	242	4	5	5	5	127294	1/26/12	Awesome teacher! Class is really fun, and he's good at explaining things. Willing to give hints that really help when doing the lab, and tests have been easier from him than from others.e
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	241	5	5	5	5	127294	10/11/11	Great Professor, really helpful and clear. Easy going, and just looks the role of his area of expertise, not a CS professor in a suit that just reads you information, he has a more active approach to teaching. 'The rockstar of the CS department at RIT'
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	127294	4/28/11	He is the best teacher for beginning computer science classes by far. He makes almost every topic seem so simple, actually answers your questions clearly, and grades fairly. And he is always so happy and smiling.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		1	5	5	5	127294	1/26/11	I can say without question that Sean Strout is my favorite professor at RIT. His lectures are clear and actually fun to be in. He cares a lot about how his students do in his classes and is more than helpful if you have any questions. He is very understanding and fair in terms of grading. Take any of his classes. You won't be disappointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	127294	10/27/10	This guy is the best! Especially for foundation classes in CS. He explains everything clearly and is straight-forward. He gives examples until you understand the topic and likes to joke to keep the class interesting! He is definitely your best bet.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	127294	10/27/10	Amazing professor. Words can not describe how good this professor really is but I'll give it a try. Basically, think of a really good friend you can make jokes with that can also teach you high level programming at the same time. Not only is he incredibly intelligent, his lectures are engaging and interesting.He'll show up to class with red sox cap
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	243	3	5	5	4	127294	2/21/10	Just about the best professor on campus. Explains everything very clearly, and is always more than happy to help. Nicest person ever. Very fair grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	127294	4/21/09	Incredible professor. He is able to teach so incredibly fast (and have us understand it) and is still a really laid-back guy. He has great charisma, and gives by far the most fun, if totally informative lectures I've had in college.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	4	127294	2/1/09	Great teacher. Going to class is fun, even though it's pretty useless for those who know C++. Wears some Boston sports uniform every day and is a really casual guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	127294	4/29/08	Best teacher I have ever had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	2	127294	3/9/08	AWESOME guy!! Explains things extremely well. If you go to him for help, he'll spend his own time explaining and helping you. I learned a lot [and understood!!] from him. Really relaxed guy. Would take his class no matter the subject. One of the best teachers I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	4	127294	10/19/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	127294	3/12/06	Didnt have for class, but he was very good in lab. Sometimes gave away too much information, but if you are stuck, it is nice to have him walk you through it. Cares more that you get it not that you necessarily figure everything out. Relatively easy grader; won't sweat much of the small stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	127294	2/7/06	Sean is the best thing about being in my learning community. He is always available for help even on aim. Really knows his stuff, and says things like "chowned". Even though he plays WoW I would recommend him over any other teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	127294	11/7/05	Take him if you can. He is an awesome professor. Help you out on projects and labs. Test are moderately tough, but gave alot of partial points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	243	4	5	5	4	127294	4/26/10	Definitely one of the better professors on campus. Lectures are fun to be in, explanations are simple, acts casual yet knowledgeable. Only regret is not signing up for my next CS course fast enough to have him as my professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	334	3	4	4	3	127294	1/31/10	Managed to keep the class' interest in the material by being fun and easygoing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	4	127294	2/3/09	Really casual and kind of geeky teacher. Knows his stuff very well though and is an excellent and helpful prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	127294	11/13/08	Sean is a great professor and his classes are a lot of fun. He knows how to keep you paying attention and how to get you to learn the subject matter. Like's to play youtube videos before class which is a nice way to get started.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	127294	4/14/08	AWESOME! Sean is one of those professors you want to take as often as possible. He is very clear in explaining new material and is very available and helpful. Compared to the other CS sections I feel like I learned a lot more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	127294	2/5/08	Best teacher I have had at RIT so far! Classes are very very relaxed but interesting. We pretty much just take notes and write code all class. Bring your laptop! Im usually a few mins late but thats okay because he starts each class with a funny youtube video or two to wake us up. We have so many inside jokes in our class now. Its great! TAKE HIM!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	127294	5/4/06	Prof. Strout is a really good professor. Very relaxed and easy-going during class and very knowledgeable about the material. If you ask for help, he'll help you for as long as it takes. If you can take him, do it without hesitation. You won't be disappointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science	123	5	5	5	5	127294	2/8/06	a totally kick ass teacher. very easy, tells you answers to questions on tests before the test and during it. brought his dog to a learning community party BUT he does play WoW and for that reason i said he wasnt hot. sorry sean. but yea if you get the opportunity to have this god as your teacher TAKE IT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	4	5	127294	11/17/05	I think enough has already been said, if you can get him, go for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	127294	10/20/05	Sean is just awesome. his ppts are clear and to the point,although can get boring at times. Always helpful whenver you need it, and leads you to writing very good code. Hes funny and quite the geek, unlike most other 50+ professors. I have had him for CS1-4 and i am glad i did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	127294	10/18/05	awesome teacher with good notes that all the kids in my major used.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	127294	3/7/05	A great teacher, he was funny and went over the material well, i was able to get an A and i am just a math major, anyone how got a lower greade should be ashamed
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	3	127294	2/2/05	Excellent Teacher. He makes class fun and enjoyable. The first day he started class with Halo2 videos. ALways available to help with projects/labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	3	127294	11/16/04	He was one of my best profs. He actually makes it interesting to come to class. Sometimes we got behind in stuff, but he always made sure we were caught up in time for lab. He answers questions very effectively. His class isn't uptight, he jokes around and makes it fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	NULL	127294	2/19/03	Very helpful and understanding.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	127294	9/28/05	Awesome teacher. First day of class he showed Red vs Blue episode. Very helpful and clear. Awesome guy and great teacher all-around.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	1	127294	2/23/05	Sean is a great teacher. Always helpful out of the classroom, and is willing to do what it takes to get someone to understand the material. And to top it all off, he's made fun of the nerds in the class on several occasions. GREAT guy to take CS with
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	4	127294	1/26/05	This guy knows his stuff. He makes actually makes class fun to go to. I don't mind sitting there for an hour listening to him babble about Threads and GUIs. Good guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Strout	4.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	4	127294	9/27/04	One of the coolest guys ever. Just ask for help, he goes through the stuff fast but he's always willing to lend a hand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	104042	2/14/13	Bill is the man! He makes classes very interesting and make sure you understand the subject. He explains things extremely clearly. Probably the best professor at RIT. Take any class you possibly can with him. Do your work, attend lecture, do good on labs, and take notes. You will get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	3	5	5	5	104042	3/1/12	Excellent lecturer. Easy to understand, covers the material well. He does post his lectures online but attendance is still recommended. Offers plenty of feedback and grades fairly. I would recommend taking him for any NSSA class, especially 516.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	5	104042	2/27/12	One of the best professors in the department. Kind of spacey on occasions, but he really does know his stuff and his excitement to teach the material is infectious- regardless of your feelings upon entry, you'll WANT to learn the material when he teaches it. A Stackpole class is an interesting, fun class. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	104042	6/28/10	I've had many classes with Bill. The content in his class is rough, but you would never learn more from another teacher in NSSA, making it well worth it to take a class with him. He is extremely fair and can be flexible, his brain is also a never ending plethora of knowledge. All of this said makes Bill Stackpole the "Chuck Norris of GCCIS".
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	351	2	5	5	4	104042	2/24/09	Great Professor had him for Network Fundamentals and he really knows his stuff. The amount of work he gives is a lot, but if you need help with something, he will take the time to explain it until you fully understand... he could make anyone able to understand networking
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	365	2	4	4	2	104042	1/21/09	Took crypto with him and it was great. It was a new class and we were allowed to take the class where we wanted to because the curriculum wasn't set in stone. Very fair and will always get back to you with an answer if he doesn't know. Knowledgeable in all areas. Lecture material can be boring but his personality makes up for it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	365	2	5	5	3	104042	11/4/08	Fun stories, interesting content, and a bit of a hottie (blush).
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	365	3	4	5	4	104042	10/6/08	This teacher is probably the most enjoyable teacher to listen at RIT. Can take boring and confusing material and make it fun and clear. Definitely will take him again next quarter. Be sure to do assignments on time and to do the readings. All quizzes were straight from the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	1	5	5	3	104042	11/29/07	Holds you to high standards but keeps your attention - One of the best and most interesting teachers I've EVER had. TAKE HIS CLASSES!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	2	5	5	3	104042	7/30/07	Lots of energy. Exciting classes that keep you interested in the content. You WON'T be sorry for taking his classes (but be SURE to submit assm'ts on time.)
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	3	5	5	4	104042	2/11/13	"that class" the one that most students fail out of the program on. The one with 100+ page labs. Doesn't sound like fun, especially winter quarter at 6pm. Billie Stacks makes it not only fun, but a class that I desired to go to every time. Don't get me wrong, it's a hard class, he just makes it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	4	5	4	4	104042	3/1/12	Always fun to have a Stackpole class. I loved lecture for Net Services with him. Lab is different; randomly walks out, is always late and theres no accountability with the TAs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	104042	12/29/10	He is def one of the best at RIT. I am pretty sure I would've hated the class if he didn't teach it. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	2	5	5	4	104042	2/1/10	Best/smartest professor in the NSSA department, having him as a professor is like having a stand up comic teach you. Really knows his stuff. Class work is hard but you will learn way more than any other teacher. I have taken 3 classes with him so far, and am looking forward to taking another course or two with him next trimester. He is the man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	3	104042	2/16/09	Bill will make you work for your grade. He is a very very smart individual. He takes slide shows to new height and will make boring items fun. He makes confusing material not so confusing. I would highly recommend Professor Stackpole to anyone.Don't expect A's unless you honestly earned it as he will not curve grades. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	365	2	5	5	5	104042	11/7/08	AMAZING professor. Do not underestimate the work he will have you do, but he is very fair, VERY knowlageable about the subject, and knows when he doesn't know something, and reseaches the answer for next class. Read the texts, pass in all assignments on time, and if you want some brownie points, buy some honey off of him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	365	3	4	5	4	104042	10/6/08	This teacher is probably the most enjoyable teacher to listen to at RIT. Can take boring and confusing material and make it fun and clear. Definitely will take him again next quarter. Be sure to do assignments on time and to do the readings. All quizzes were straight from the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	1	5	4	4	104042	2/26/08	Awesome teacher. He will go out of his way to help you out. He REALLY knows the material. Presentations can get a little slow, but he will start telling an interesting story, and it will become fun again. 516 takes A LOT of work, but is worth it once you have finished the class. He is a great guy out of class as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	104042	9/4/07	Probably one of the best teachers in all of building 70. Boom shacka lacka.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	421	2	4	5	4	104042	12/16/06	Willing to help...if you can catch him. Makes something boring very entertaining.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	2	5	5	4	104042	5/16/06	Really know his stuff. Tough class and lab but he made it enjoyable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	104042	10/14/05	Awesome. Fun, interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	2	5	4	3	104042	5/17/05	LOTS of reading and long written reports required. GREAT professor - goes out of his way to help. Keeps class interesting and fun (even when topics are not so fun). Won't give you a **** answer - instead will research unanswered questions and address them next class. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	3	5	5	5	104042	12/2/04	He knows what he is talking about. He WILL MAKE YOU WORK. But if you can keep up with reading and pay attention in class then you are fine. He will help you outside of class too. Very friendly. You should take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	5	104042	11/27/04	if you don't like real geeks, this guy will make you homicidal

Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	NULL	104042	12/20/02	Intelligent, clear, very helpful. A bit too fast, but will wait if asked. GREAT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	516	2	5	5	5	104042	4/27/06	Probably the best professor I've ever had a class with at RIT, bar-none. I never thought I'd be as attentive in an 8:30 class as I was in this.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	4	4	104042	9/20/05	One of the few lecturers I didn't mind listening to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	0	Computer Science	516	1	1	1	5	104042	12/29/04	If he is a good teacher there would not be OVERT discontent among ALL students. Class expressions contort and turn to frowns when he enters the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	4	104042	11/29/04	Obviously the people above have never taken Prof. Stackpole. He's easily the best teacher I've ever had and I'd take his classes again in a hearbeat. All his classes will fill within a few hours of registration opens while others do not. He makes you work, but makes it easy and interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	4	104042	10/21/04	He will be the biggest mistake of your college career. Unreasonable doesn't even begin to describe. Knowledge that belongs in a reference dictionary he will make you memorize. Doesn't know two bits what's important in the real world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stackpole	4.4	2	Computer Science	422	3	5	4	NULL	104042	2/17/03	Knows his limitations , gives it his all
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Stainslow	1.5	0	Information Technology		3	1	2	2	1577425	5/10/11	Never really answered all of our questions, keeps on telling us to read our books instead of giving us a simple answer. He can have a bad temper at times. Worst teacher in NTID!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	3	4	736854	3/22/13	Pretty good really. Friendly guy, nice to talk to. Could be more clear in lectures. Tests are fairly difficult but reasonable. Projects interesting but inconsistently documented.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	4	736854	3/3/13	Ben Steele is a terrible teacher. Although he may know a lot he is incapable of communicating it well. He never has time to help out students and his draconian grading policies and refusal to allow test retakes or postponements don't help either. If you're looking for a real understanding of the course material, don't choose Ben Steele.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		2	4	3	4	736854	2/27/12	Sometimes difficult to follow in lectures, but he's good if you can get him one-on-one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	3	4	5	736854	11/30/11	He's an okay guy, the labs are fairly easy and so are the projects. Be warned though, the exams are notoriously difficult in how they are graded, usually tipping on something trivial.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	5	736854	7/4/11	Computer Science One in python is very easy, period. However, I got a B in the course. Why? Quite simply put, Steele's exams are notorious for asking things that were never taught. Not to mention the man is unable to properly answer questions and will only insult students or tell them to go through pseudo-code again. Nunes- Harwitt is better!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	4	736854	10/26/10	Definetly the worst professor I have ever had. When you ask him a question he goes on answering something you rly didn't care about and then leaves you with nothing. He grades really hard and is a prick about design. He won't tell you how he wants your design and then takes more points than something is worth away because you didn't do it his way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science	233	4	5	3	4	736854	10/20/09	Pretty easy teacher. He uses student graders and they can sometimes be tough. But he is an easy grader for exams. Not the best professor but good enough for the subject material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science	334	5	5	4	5	736854	3/12/09	I had Steele for both CS4 lecture and lab. His lectures are OK if a bit boring, and his grading is fair. But it was in lab and one-on-one that he was very helpful; he was very knowledgeable about the tools we were using and willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science	450	4	5	5	5	736854	2/23/09	This professor is pretty helpful and an easy-grader. His tests are not that hard, if you study all the slides, you will get a high grade. Always gives an extra credit assignment, so that students can get some higher grades. I would definitely recommend this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	1	Computer Science		2	2	3	4	736854	11/5/08	Nothing really special about this professor. Was consistently nearly late for class and always rushed off after class. Handled questions asked by the class often incompletely. Not a very good professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	3	736854	3/8/13	I too would have to say avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	5	736854	11/10/12	Very boring and hard to follow in class. His labs are very confusing and its hard to understand what needs to be done at first. Goes around answers asked in class, or doesnt explain them clearly. Least favorite teacher this quarter, would recommend avoiding if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science	241	2	1	2	4	736854	2/10/12	HE is an ok teacher. The first few weeks of the class is easy but then when it gets more difficult he can not answer questions. He goes around your question. Not a very good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	1	Computer Science		3	3	2	4	736854	10/28/11	Although Steele did an okay job, he sometimes omitted some key component of the lesson. He was poor at answering questions, often proceeding after providing only a very brief attempt at clarification and without regard to whether or not an understanding had been established. He knows the material; the problem arises in his attempt to convey it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	736854	5/20/11	Not bad at all. If you want a good grade, sit towards the front and be invovled: especially during Problem Solving. He really knows his material, although he's not too good with design patterns (most CS professors are not though). Nice guy. Speaks loud and clear. Quick grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	1	736854	10/25/10	His lectures are extremely boring and put you to sleep rather than teach. When you ask a question, he gives an answer to something you weren't looking for. Grading is okay at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	4	736854	4/27/09	Absolutely horrible professor. He gave me a -4 out of 10 on design and felt it was justified. He knows very little about the material and demonstrates that in his lectures. Avoid if possible, and if not possible, switch your major.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	736854	3/10/09	He's a nice guy, didn't always know answers to questions asked in class but was more then willing to find out the answers. Easy grader, I got a B with out having to try to hard and he's was always willing to work with people.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	1	Computer Science	232	2	2	4	5	736854	11/17/08	He's an alright teacher, nothing special; although he does tend to trail off on very trivial questions during lecture. Homework is hard considering there is no actual solution that he says he wants. There probably are better CS teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	736854	10/25/08	Pretty good professor. Explained things clearly and was there when you needed help. The course material itself was easy, so you should have no problems getting a B, if not an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science	334	1	2	2	4	736854	2/29/08	He claims to have some industry experience, but it doesn't show. He has little knowledge of the material. When asked some straightforward questions in class, he did not know, but he'd have to try it to see what would happen. He has great trouble keeping the class quiet and respectful. Also, the textbook was useless. Nice guy, but I'll avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	1	3	5	736854	6/16/07	By far the most aggravating professor I've ever had. Tests were more difficult than those of other professors teaching the same class. Asked questions about things he glazed over in lecture. Did a very poor job of explaining the material. Very strict grader, especially if you have him for lab. Avoid this professor at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		5	5	3	3	736854	1/12/07	Not a bad professor, if you took CS in HS he is a good professor to take just to get through it again. No out of class assignments to speak of. Fairly easy grader. Easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	3	736854	10/27/06	He gives a lot of handouts which are really useful, but does not spend enough time explaining them, your on your own for a good amount time. You can go see him, it would help but not enough. His tests are hard, I recommend going to the TAs for help. Try not to get this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	1	Computer Science		4	3	3	4	736854	8/8/06	He was an okay teacher, but nothing spectacular. He seemed fair in his grading, and the material he covered was adequate in comparison to what the department expects you to know by the end of the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	1	Computer Science		1	2	3	4	736854	11/7/05	He make my life so miserable that I decided to change my major. This was 20041. Very strict on grading the lab, especially commenting. he cut you no break watsoever. I personally would avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science	232	2	1	2	4	736854	7/2/07	Expects you to teach yourself, but he doesn't mention that.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	4	3	5	736854	1/27/07	Decently easy. Has a very monotone voice and you'll probably learn more from the textbook and labs than from him. He's nice and easy though. Random homework assignments throughout the quarter. Tests aren't too hard and neither is his grading style. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		1	1	2	4	736854	1/8/07	He knows the class materials well, but don't care of anyone learn from his class. You better read and know the the materials before going to his class or else you will be totally lost. He doesn't explain anything in details so you need to learn that ur self. You will most likely fail his class, do avoid him if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	5	736854	10/25/06	He is a fool of a professor. He doesn't explain concepts well nor does he really effectivly go over coding. Avoid this teacher if you value your major and your grade are important to you. Half of my class failed the first test everyone else got C's and D's then a quarter didn't finish the second test and he didn't care...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	736854	11/9/05	Great teacher. He really knows what he's talking about and is very easy to approach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Steele	2.8	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	736854	10/25/05	He is one of the best CS teachers I have ever had in my life. He explains everything and has no problems answering questions. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Stella	5.0	2	Communication		4	5	5	5	852165	5/23/06	Great professor, very helpful, and always willing to keep the class interested. Also he brings a lot of speakers to the class from important companies which is very cool. His real world examples are great and they relate to the course. His exams are fair and dont require much reading but attendance in class. I highly recommend this course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Stevens	4.5	2	Engineering	415	4	4	5	4	1438469	5/24/10	Great professor. Explains the concepts well and uses plenty of examples as well as "team problems" to get you to learn the material. Nice guy overall
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stevenson	3.5	2	Management		4	5	5	4	1396300	5/19/12	Read the text book, do the HW questions, do the online quizzes, ASK QUESTIONS and you WILL get an A. HW isn't graded but are vital to your understanding. Quiz questions are basically taken straight from the online quizzes and book. Same with exams. Lets you out super early every class using the beautiful weather as in excuse. Would take again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stevenson	3.5	0	Management	401	1	1	2	3	1396300	7/19/10	He wrote the textbook, and that's a warning. Learning the big details are necessary, but he only tests on the tiny, insignificant things that only the author could possibly know. Homework is collected, so no chance to review your knowledge except for impossible exams. 300% Boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stevenson	3.5	2	Management	743	3	5	4	2	1396300	8/17/10	Not the most interesting subject matter, but he tries to liven it up. He uses humor and videos to engage the class. He is very accessible and approachable, and the exams are not too difficult if you study for them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stevenson	3.5	1	Management		1	2	4	1	1396300	2/3/10	He is SO boring! Really bad professor. Just lectures about the most boring material. He uses his own book, which tells you a lot... He assigns HW but doesn't collect it, so that just makes you not want to learn. His 2 tests are SUPER hard. No curves whatsoever. DO NO RECOMMEND AT ALL.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Stone	4.5	2	Information Science		4	4	5	1	402498	7/3/06	Rick is no longer at RIT, but he was an awesome teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Stone	4.5	2	Information Science		3	5	4	NULL	402498	5/5/04	Best teacher for required Computer Concepts. He has trouble reading names on tests, but it's not his fault. Great teacher. Loves Star Trek.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	2	Information Technology	486	4	4	4	4	296192	7/27/08	I took two courses with Prof Stratton, and both were very good. He knows his stuff, and presents it in a way that people can understand. Was always willing to answer questions. The quirky sense of humor was an added bonus
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	296192	4/6/06	He is cool. One of the best proff i have ever seen. Very helpful. Knows a lot about what he is teaching.Overall a Great Proff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	296192	10/27/05	Stratton is cool, he wants us to catch him a squirrel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	2	Information Technology		2	5	5	5	296192	1/24/05	Great Teacher. Knows his stuff. Read the powerpoints study them pay attention in class and make your crib sheet off the ppt slides your will do well
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	1	Information Technology		2	3	3	3	296192	5/26/06	He taught all of the necessary information via PPT slides, but still, in most cases he's not clear. And, he's not a fair grader at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	0	Information Technology	360	3	3	1	3	296192	11/9/05	bad
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Stratton	3.8	1	Information Technology		3	3	2	3	296192	10/23/05	Coming from a background with no java, it was very hard to learn how he taught. He likes to hear himself talk, if you like someone that talks the whole time, this is your man. I learn better actually doing the coding.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies		5	5	5	5	1630075	9/4/12	Nice teacher and helpful. Weekly assignments are not difficult and there are study guides for tests. Class lectures can get a bit long, but it's an easy A if you do the work. Definitely recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies	201	5	3	4	4	1630075	1/27/12	Honestly, in the beginning of the quarter I wasn't really paying attention, so it was really boring. But then like midway through I started to pay attention and it was actually very interesting! It became one of my favorite classes. Pretty easy grader and offers extra credit here and there. Not much homework. Study for tests though!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies	201	4	4	4	1	1630075	11/3/11	The class is very boring. straight lecture for 2 hours. monotone. i would only suggest going to class on days with videos and tests. just study the powerpoints she posts online. usually quizzes are take home which is very easy to do with the powerpoints. exams are same questions that are on the quizzes plus a few more. dont buy the book, never used
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies		5	4	4	1	1630075	11/3/11	very easy. attendance really isn't necessary. i would almost suggest not going to class. her lectures are by far the the most boring thing you will ever have to go through. study the PP slides on your own time you will get a good grade on the tests/quizzes. her tests have the same questions as the quizzes. btw don't buy the book - its not needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies	201	4	4	4	4	1630075	10/24/11	super hot, and super easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies		4	4	4	3	1630075	5/24/12	Interesting class, adequate professor. A lot of information and assignments but it's all doable. Study for the exams though. Great class to clear a lib art requirement though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	0	Environmental Studies	201	5	2	2	1	1630075	11/17/11	really Boring lectures. but the class is easy and Professor Strobl is very nice! she enjoys what she teaches and she will help you if you don't understand. turning things in late will result in 10% off. textbook isn't used. she's kind of cute too! don't take if you fall asleep easy. study quizzes, tests are exactly alike.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies		5	4	5	3	1630075	11/3/11	Super nice professor, and really easy. Once in a while gives bonus points for attendance cause not many come to class. For the exams study the powerpoints and know all of the words on the crossword. Never used the textbook, kinda mad I actually bought it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Strobl	4.0	2	Environmental Studies		5	5	5	5	1630075	11/1/11	I agree, cute professor and very easy. Take-Home quizzes and the test are meade up from the quizzes and reviews sha gives. Take is you really want an A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ulrike Stroszeck-Goemans	5.0	2	Languages		2	5	5	4	1098352	11/21/10	She is an amazing teacher and always explains everything very clearly. As long as you attend class and review the vocabulary, you'll be speaking German in no time. Grade is based on several chapter exams, homework, participation, an oral interview, and a short acting skit. One of the nicest people you'll meet at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ulrike Stroszeck-Goemans	5.0	2	Languages	460	4	5	5	5	1098352	9/7/10	She was outstanding! I really learned a lot in her class. I agree, the teacher this quarter doesn't compare at all. I would definitely take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ulrike Stroszeck-Goemans	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	4	1098352	1/27/08	Class can be fast paced. She is willing to help you out if needed. Class for the most part is taught in German unless she has to explain an assignment. Great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ulrike Stroszeck-Goemans	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	3	1098352	9/30/10	she is nice but the class is hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ulrike Stroszeck-Goemans	5.0	2	Languages		3	5	5	5	1098352	12/17/08	She's the best! Extremely friendly and helpful, and really aims for student participation. Always bubbly and fun. The best teacher I've had at RIT; this quarter's German teacher simply does not compare.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Sumberg	1.0	0	Physics	471	1	1	1	3	1533644	8/22/11	Worse teacher ever!!! I was an adult that had been going to college for 20 years he was by far the worst teacher i have ever had!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Sutton	3.5	1	Fine Arts		3	3	3	4	1514660	2/27/12	Her assignments are sometimes vague or unclear, and there's a lot of repetition in her class. Grading isn't that hard as long as you use the ideas she likes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Sutton	3.9	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	1747946	1/23/13	Great Professor! Easy course if you study and attend class. Very interesting studies and experiments completed in class. She really cares about how you do and reaches out to help students. As long as you put in effort, she will make sure you get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Sutton	3.9	0	Psychology		1	2	2	1	1747946	10/30/12	Nice lady but class was tough. Reads off a powerpoint most the time and includes a few movies and activities in class. Miss one day and you will miss at least 10 points on the next test. You have to rely on students to tell you what you missed which wasn't that great when they didn't understand something as well. Not recommended for Cognitive Psych
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Sutton	3.9	2	Psychology	443	3	5	5	3	1747946	11/1/12	She is a great professor. One of the most willing to help. She will meet with you if you need extra help understanding material. She goes over your notes before the test and tells you exactly what to study. If you do the readings and know the experiments discussed, you will do fine. Lab reports are a breeze if you are in class to participate.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tina Sutton	3.9	2	Psychology		2	4	3	4	1747946	10/28/12	Not a fan of this teacher. Her tests aren't easy. Some of the littlest details that are easy to miss in class are on the exams. 3 exams, 2 papers, and a few small assignments. She's a very nice lady but I would not take a class with her again. Attendance is a must if you want to pass. Take with another professor if your looking for an easy class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing		4	5	5	2	873248	3/5/12	Little bit strict but very nice and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	0	Writing		2	2	2	1	873248	10/23/10	this class was the easiest B you possibly earn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	1	Writing		5	3	2	1	873248	5/30/10	She is the easiest A you can ever get in Arts of Expression. Just do your work and you will get the A. However, she is one of the most biased individual out there so be prepared to argue back if she tries to rip you apart. Not a very bright woman!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing	272	5	5	5	1	873248	2/4/10	Professor Swartzfager is a goddess of writing seminar. I thought I would hate this class going into it but she makes it easy and fun. You get out of class between 45 minutes and an hour early almost everyday (as long as you finish your work). As long as you do all 3 papers and the journals you will have no problem getting atleast a B. 2 thumbs up!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing	502	4	4	5	5	873248	2/7/08	A really nice teacher. The class was very interesting, and straight forward. As long as you come to class, and do your work, you should get a good grade. Be prepared to write well. Definitely one of my favorite teachers for this quarter!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing		5	5	4	4	873248	11/12/11	A really nice teacher. Do your homework and you will get A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	1	Writing		2	2	3	1	873248	10/23/10	She needs work at teaching people how to write. i was totally confused throughout the whole quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing		4	5	4	3	873248	5/20/10	I actually don't believe in perfect attendance but this was a class that I looked forward to attending. You can actually get her to talk about her days of protesting and helping out with desegregating schools in the south a while back. She's a rebel and a really good teacher to talk to one on one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing	502	3	4	4	3	873248	4/29/09	She is a very good teacher when it comes to writing. You write three essays and she is a very easy grader. Not that bad of a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paulette Swartzfager	4.0	2	Writing	502	5	5	5	3	873248	2/22/07	Great class - the globalisation topics that were covered made the class more interesting and makes you want to go to class. As long as you try your best, do your work, talk to your classmates and attend class you'll be fine. I wasn't looking forward to the classes at the beginning of the quarter, but it has turned out to be a fun and enriching clas
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hyla Sweet	3.8	1	Biology		3	3	2	3	1126474	2/22/13	She mostly read off her slides, only explains a little bit if you ask questions, mostly answers "Don't Know" to harder questions. Provides powerpoint and practice sheet for the chapters covered. You will have weekend HW on BioPortal where questions are structured poorly. Tests are fair but questions wordy and confusing. I-clickers used.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hyla Sweet	3.8	2	Biology	251	5	5	4	5	1126474	10/21/11	A great professor! She is lenient on grading the lab notebook and quizzes. Very helpful and if you need any help just meet her during her office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hyla Sweet	3.8	1	Biology	251	4	2	4	5	1126474	11/28/11	Intro bio lab instructor. Lenient grader, ambiguous practical questions. Weekly lab homeworks graded by TA. Instructor babied a lab full of bio-related majors, wasting the first 45 minutes on overly thorough review of lab methods described in manual on a weekly basis. Annoying, but an easy enough component of the Bio 251 grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hyla Sweet	3.8	2	Biology	412	3	5	5	5	1126474	8/27/08	developmental biology. very thorough. you have no excuse not to do well in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	1	67419	2/24/13	AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The department made her change her tests because they were too easy and now they are ridiculous. Cannot understand anything she says in class or anything she writes on the board. Homework on the other hand, is reasonable. Most material was self-taught through the assignments. Don't understand how or why she is still a professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	4	67419	11/8/12	Terrible. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. It is dull and you never learn anything. Makes mistakes at the board. Only does problem examples. There is always somebody sleeping in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67419	10/31/12	Take someone else. Anyone else, really. 'Difficult to understand' is the understatement of the century. Homework is mandatory, but she does hand back the solutions with work, which is really awesome. Same for tests. Couldn't understand a word she said. Couldn't see the board. Be prepared to learn out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics	305	4	4	4	4	67419	5/24/12	She has an accent, but its easy to understand. She writes small so sit in the front. Her test questions straight to the point, but don't ask things directly (nothing as basic as: Find the derivative of __). She gives out almost no partial credit, so check your work. Overall I thought she was a very good teacher. I would take another of her courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	4	67419	3/3/12	Hard to understand. Does not teach. Hard to even understand test questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	4	2	2	4	67419	11/22/11	She was a true challenge at first. Her thick accent is hard to understand. She gets confused by questions and only goes over examples during class. She gets better later in the term as you start to understand her. She has a sense of humor. Frequently says "excuse me" for no reason and to no particular individual during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	1	67419	11/3/11	AVOID AT ALL COST!!!! DOES NOT GIVES PARTIAL CREDIT. Only one hour exams... Disorganized. On one of my test (out of 8 problems) I got 6 perfectly right and the other 2 problems I was expecting partial credit. Guess what!!!?? I got a 69. NO PARTIAL CREDIT. AVOIDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	1	67419	10/22/11	She is very funny at times but also very hard to understand. She works through problems very quickly, usually too quickly to follow. Her exams are nothing like the homework and are very difficult; she does not give much partial credit. If you are naturally good at math and can teach yourself she is a good professor otherwise she is very difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	3	1	1	3	67419	10/15/11	Refuses to answer direct questions from the students. Works through problems on the whiteboard while ignoring over-arching concepts and principles. Does not come prepared to lecture the class beyond one small scrap of paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics		5	3	3	4	67419	5/7/11	Very friendly teacher, with some corny jokes. You will get used to her accent quite easily. She teaches what you need to know but you still have to make use of the book to understand the material properly. Low level for homework and exams. Easy A if you study a little bit and do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics	305	1	3	2	2	67419	11/18/12	Very hard to understand in class - the mix of her accent, the math, and staying awake makes for a 2 hour hell. If you go to her office hours she is extremely helpful, but other than that you will end up teaching yourself something. DEFINITELY don't take an 8 am with her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67419	11/4/12	Though she has an accent, she speaks slow enough you can understand her and is willing to repeat as necessary. Explains in detail, all homework answers are in the solutions manual and the tests are the easiest I have taken, just know your formulas. Great if you have trouble with the algebra portion of Calculus, you won't be tested on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	4	67419	10/9/12	Hard to understand but thats not really the problem, she doesn't teach or explain anything at all and you pretty much have to teach it to yourself if you want to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67419	4/26/12	Honestly one of the best teachers at the institute. I strongly recommended her if you want an easy A and to understand multivariable calculus
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	1	1	1	4	67419	3/1/12	Just awful. Worst professor I've ever had. She cannot teach and lost our graded papers with her other class numerous times. Could not answer questions, half the time couldn't understand the question. I don't know what she does to make her a professor but she is awful. Avoid like the plague.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	67419	11/19/11	She know's what she's talking about but hasn't mastered how to pass her knowledge onto others. She can but funny at times but basically, you need to teach yourself the material if you want to do well. There is no partial credit on exams so make sure you study hard. She does come up with some clever examples to help you remember things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67419	11/1/11	Can't understand a thing she says. Explains things in the worst ways. Just avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	67419	10/18/11	Avoid. Accent isn't as bad as some people claim; it's manageable. What isn't manageable is the teaching quality. Working through "such problems" have little to no bearing on the tests, and she makes more mistakes than any professor I have ever seen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	3	1	1	3	67419	10/15/11	Refuses to answer direct questions from the students. Works through problems on the whiteboard while ignoring over-arching concepts and principles. Does not come prepared to lecture the class beyond one small scrap of paper.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	2	1	1	1	67419	4/25/11	She speaks 5 languages, and English is not one of her strong languages. Extremely hard to understand. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	1	2	1	4	67419	1/31/11	She was a very hard teacher. Urgg so frustrating listening to her everyday gave hw out from the book every class. Test were mad hard. dont listen to tht guy up there must have been tht kid tht knew everything in class...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	67419	11/21/10	absolutely terrible. gives little to no partial credit on test, cannot understand her lectures, gives wrong equations, messes up examples more often than not, and gets confused by students questions so she just moves on and leaves it unanswered. do not take unless you want to teach yourself
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	4	67419	11/5/10	She isn't all that bad. Her writing and speech can be tough to understand, but she is kind of funny and definitely teaches what you need to learn. Definitely use the text to help. Homework level is low. Grading policy is nice especially if you can ace the Final
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	5	1	2	5	67419	4/2/10	An absolute joke, her class is an easy A if you read the book, do the homework, and DON'T listen to a word she says.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	1	67419	4/21/09	Worst calc professor I have ever had. Stumbles upon her words. Did not know what the fundamental theorem of calculus was. Makes constant errors on the board. Thick accent. The only good thing about her is that homework counts at 30% and final replaces lowest test grade. Useless teacher, I taught myself. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	231	3	2	1	4	67419	11/18/08	She isnt a very good teacher. avoid her if u can. i already knew the material before the class and the way she taught got me confused. Shes nice and all but shes a horrible teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	67419	2/6/08	Avoid at all costs!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	3	67419	11/16/07	other instructors at the Rochester Institute of Technology should be ashamed to have her hold the same title as them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	67419	2/23/07	Absolutely useless. Has really no right to be teaching us discrete math. Has trouble counting to 13 (she skipped 12).Much of her time is spent saying, "hokay" or "back up" because she makes so many mistakes. Many times (2/3) she would grade our tests, give them back to us, and not record the grades. She is horribly disorganized and lectures = crap.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics	305	5	5	5	5	67419	10/11/06	I had her for multivariable calculus. She has a strong accent, but it is managable. She goes through examples in detail, and draws very good pictures that help understand the topic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics	305	5	4	4	3	67419	1/31/11	She is definitely one of the best math teachers at RIT. I took her class last year and she was really helpful both in class and during her office hours. Would definitely recommend taking her again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		4	3	1	3	67419	11/17/10	Heavy accent and chicken scratch handwriting, that's all you need to know about Wanda. By far the worst teacher I've had at RIT so far. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	4	67419	10/25/10	Her foreign accent makes her hard to understand sometimes and her writing is illegible but the homeworks and tests are very easy to pass if you understand the basics of the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	232	3	1	1	3	67419	3/23/10	Wanda is a terrible professor. She might know what she's talking about at some points, but can't teach it. She stumbles over words, and her handwriting is ridiculous. However, if you go to class and do homework, you can pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	305	2	2	1	2	67419	11/24/08	Hard to understand most of the time, writing very hard to read, ridiculously hard tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	302	3	1	2	2	67419	3/11/08	Terrible. Confuses herself often, rarely understands students questions and can never answer them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	2	67419	1/23/08	Seems easily frustrated by the material. Confused by students questions so she leaves them unanswered. When half the class leaves in the middle to go read the book themselves, something's wrong. More like an independent study than a lecture. If you skip and do the problems yourself, you're no worse off.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		5	1	1	1	67419	10/17/07	She reads the book to you, gets confused and messes up examples. Don't commit anything she is saying to memory... It's probably wrong. When asked if the test is open book her reply was "I don't care".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	4	67419	10/23/06	She has a accent... and when she starts stuttering and repeating herself SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG and doesnt know where it is in her example. The tests were fairly difficult. She can't really explain things too clearly while talking, but if you follow along in the example you should be fine... that is if she doesnt mess the numbers up midway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	3	67419	5/12/06	Not the best teacher, but very nice. Willing to help if you need it. An easy class if you have a backround in the information; she is a good teacher to have to review stuff but not to learn it for the first time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		4	1	2	2	67419	5/11/06	She's easily confused during examples, the class is a waste of time she doesn't explain anything, she assigns homework but doesn't collect it, gives weekly quizzes directly out of the homework and you can use your notes and your book if you ask, and we had formula sheets for the test, probably all to make up for her lack of teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	67419	10/21/05	Easy...not bad just do work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	67419	5/22/05	Her tests are not incredibly difficult and her quizzes are easy if you know the material. She doesn't assign homework and attendance is not mandatory.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		2	5	3	3	67419	2/13/05	Very friendly and personable once you scratch the surface. Very thick accent. Moves very quickly through the course material. Always willing to give extra help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		3	3	1	NULL	67419	7/29/04	Horrible teacher. I never missed a class and sat in the front. She still never knew my name. I couldnt understand anything because of her accent, she gives no homework to help bring up grades and her hand writing is unreadable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	NULL	67419	9/25/03	Kinda hard to understand, and just teaches out of the book. Still cant figure out how we're supposed to do the problems when she cant. Oh, and it is a she, for whoever didnt know why his name was Wanda :P.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics		3	3	3	NULL	67419	2/18/03	Difficult final
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		5	3	4	4	67419	5/11/06	Has a very strong accent, but nice overall. She actually let us use our notes and book and all three tests. If you can handle accents, then take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics		5	1	1	1	67419	8/31/05	you dont undertand her, she doesnt know how to explain things, and shes always making mistakes for everything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	0	Mathematics	216	1	1	1	4	67419	2/21/05	Unless you already know the topic, avoid her like the plague.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	1	Mathematics		2	3	2	NULL	67419	10/2/03	She's no nonsense...kinda difficult ..moves a long soooo fast! Im still writing down the problem when she has already finished explaining it. I cant learn this way.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wanda Szpunar-Lojasiewicz	2.1	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	NULL	67419	5/26/03	Has a strong east european accent.Very helpful outside of class.Makes sure that everyone understands the subject.Exams are easy.I can't figure out why his name is Wanda!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yuki Taguchi	4.4	2	Japanese		1	4	5	5	1344043	3/19/12	She was very helpful but her class is challenging. She is super funny and a great professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yuki Taguchi	4.4	2	Japanese	280	5	4	5	5	1344043	5/13/10	Though her accent can be at first difficult to understand, she is an awesome professor who makes learning Japanese easy and fun. The daily speaking exercises really help a lot to learning the material. Not to mention we didn't go one class without laughing. But make sure you do the work and go to class, you don't want to fall behind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yuki Taguchi	4.4	2	Japanese	481	5	4	4	5	1344043	2/3/10	class can be funny at times and she tries to get students to understand the material. the daily performances help with speaking skills. it's well balanced between class learning and self-studying. if you don't study for like 10 minutes a day to remember things, it's gonna be hard... it's a totally new language after all. I'd recommend her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yuki Taguchi	4.4	2	Japanese		4	5	4	5	1344043	2/3/11	I had Taguchi-sensei for a # of Jp classes & she is my favorite. She is funny, uses visual aids, plans the class well, & makes the ridiculous amount of work bearable. The most notable/helpful thing she does is make drawings for the vocab & verbs, so speaking isn't as difficult as it could be. I took Lee and found her class much harder!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yuki Taguchi	4.4	2	Japanese		4	5	4	5	1344043	3/25/10	I had Taguchi-sensee for Beg. Japanese I, and I loved her class. The workload is somewhat large but very doable, and the performances are very helpful in understanding the material. To top it off, she is very funny and class is a lot of fun. If you're able to, you won't regret taking her, as long as you're willing to do the work and not slack.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Talty	3.0	0	Packaging Science		5	1	3	3	1499447	11/21/11	Absolutely useless but the class is extremely easy. I ended the class with a 101.2. Just skim the textbook before quizzes and you'll do great. Mini-quizzes are a piece of cake. Just wait for other people to answer first so you can see what they say. Took until the end of the quarter to grade anything. Never responded to emails or messages.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lisa Talty	3.0	2	Packaging Science	503	5	4	4	3	1499447	5/10/11	Online packaging container systems class. Easy to succeed. Online quizzes are really easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business		2	4	3	5	977877	11/16/12	He always took 1 or 2 points off my assignments. Very knowledgeable. Long tests and hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business		3	4	4	4	977877	3/4/12	Dr. Tang was a great professor. Accent can be difficult to understand, but class can be fun and he has a great sense of humor. Very respectable. His tests are 100% based off of his slides, I didn't buy the book, just used it in the library for a few hw assignments. Final was pretty hard though. Overall a great professor, I highly recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business	101	4	4	5	3	977877	5/21/11	Best dressed professor at RIT. Tests are tricky, but if you memorize the slides you're all set. Final project is a 40 minute presentation, but pretty much based on how well you can keep the class' attention.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business		5	4	4	4	977877	11/19/09	Strong accent aside, he is a great professor. Really knows his stuff, tests are easy if you study, and the big project/presentation at the end is very interesting and thought provoking. Highly recommended if you're into international business in any way!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	1	Business	310	3	4	2	4	977877	2/2/08	Nice guy, don't let his stern exterior fool you. Ask for help and he'll give it. Don't fall asleep in the class you need to have full attention to bring in what he's saying
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business	123	4	5	4	4	977877	7/18/12	WOB course. Great professor. Knows his stuff, goes out of his way to help you and is fair. Tests are hard, but fair because it is based entirely on his slides. I highly recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business	310	3	5	4	5	977877	8/21/11	Hot asian professor, haha! Anyway, you will do fine in his class if you memorize and memorize and truly understand what's on his powerpoint. His powerpoints are like study guide, only based strongly on what you should know. I strongly recommend reading the textbook, a chapter before each lecture. Then you will have no problem understanding Tang. A!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	2	Business		4	5	3	4	977877	5/12/10	fantastic professor, very knowledgeable. He isn't as harsh as he looks, and he is very fair. keeps you well informed, and the tests are fairly easy, and fair. they are all multiple choice, and true/false. few homework assignments, all from the books, all very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Zhi Tang	3.9	1	Business		4	3	3	4	977877	10/12/09	Good professor. Once you get past his strong accent he's very easy to follow. He can get a little fast during the lectures but all of them are up o myCourses. Tests are easy and fair. Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics	272	3	4	3	3	273954	9/20/06	The Man, The Legend. Tascione was a decent teacher. Very concerned students learned the material. Made mistakes on examples, but was clear and fixed them. Moderate tests/quizes and strict grader. Certainly easy to get a good grade if you put an ounce of energy in. Famous for saying "Probably" and "People...". Also removed glasses to stress points
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	273954	1/28/06	He's an old man who's been teaching this stuff for quite a while as he'll tell you. He gives a fair amount of homework (doesn't collect) and gets mad if the class doesn't have questions about it. He can seem grumpy at times but he explains things quite well which is why I stayed with him throughout the sequence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	3	273954	8/30/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	273954	1/27/05	I LOVE this professor! I would take him for all of my classes if that were possible! He is very helpful and always takes the time to help students out with whatever questions they may have. I highly recommend Tascione!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	NULL	273954	4/14/04	Great Teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	NULL	273954	11/11/03	a tollerable teacher: LOTS of homework. he spends a decent amount of time going over it though. he's always willing to meet with students outside of class (especially females). Just stay on his good side.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	273954	2/7/06	My God.. This man cannot teach, how does he have so many good ratings?! He makes an error every time he does an example and is just a generally bad teacher. Sure his tests are fairly easy, but I signed up for this class to learn something, not to get some BS grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	4	273954	10/5/05	very good, he's a flighty old man and kinda cranky, but you get used to how he teaches, and as long as you stay on top of your work you'll get it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	273954	2/1/05	He gives a lot of hmwrk but he goes through all the problems in class. He doesnt collect it but in order to pass his class you should do it anyway. He's very helpful and nice when he knows that you're trying your best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics	271	3	4	4	3	273954	10/21/04	He goes over the homework in class and helps you through any problems you have, you just have to ask.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rick Tascione	3.9	2	Mathematics	241	3	4	4	NULL	273954	12/4/03	My Grade: C Professor Tascione is very approachable, and usually available with office hours. He expects students to do their assigned homework ("You need to do your homework people..."). All in all, he is a good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	4	761512	11/19/12	Taking Intro to Ethics with this professor can be easy since there is no homework, just quizzes. The attendance is not mandatory. You just show up in the class for quiz and exams. But beware, there is not a lot of points in quizzes and tests. You can lose a lot of points over bad quizzes and etc. Easy professor but Be careful of quizzes and exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		4	3	5	1	761512	12/12/11	The textbook is a little hard to understand but he clarifies things in class. However, he is extremely BORING! Most people are on their laptops but if you are able to hear his lectures you should be able to pass easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	0	Philosophy		5	1	1	1	761512	9/27/10	This guy is utterly useless. He creates his own text is an absolute egoist about it. His lectures are mundane and put half the class to sleep. He doesn't make himself available outside of the class. Avoid at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	761512	11/16/09	The notes you take can cover 50-60% of what is in tests. The rest -- you find yourself through reading.Lots of difficult reading. Overall the teacher is very nice and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	3	761512	12/5/08	This is the most chill guy you will ever meet. He's a fun teacher, nice guy... Take his classes if at all possible, it's an easy A and fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	761512	10/27/06	This guy is great! He makes an interesting topic even more interesting than it has to be the uninteresting topics are better. He is really funny and energetic and the way he teaches keeps the class awake. His grading is really lenient and his tests are really easy, if you copy everything he writes you are sure to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	761512	11/19/05	Just excellent. I don't think any professor in the Philosophy department can beat Dr. Suits' teaching style. His lectures are never boring, and his grading is very lenient. An A+ professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	5	761512	5/19/12	He is a very nice guy, always making little jokes. Teaches the course at a bit too much of an elementary level, but explains things well. I can't speak for his other courses, but if you are considering taking Philosophy of Mind, take it with Aguilar instead. It's his area of expertise, and he teaches it *incredibly* well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy	446	4	4	5	3	761512	10/31/11	Great teacher, made topics a lot of fun and really enjoys having conversations with students in class and is open to their ideas. Would love to take more classes with him. If your are a Philosophy major or concentrator make sure you take a class with him. And ask him about Epicurus!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	4	761512	2/1/10	Great guy! Interesting lectures for the most part, and clarifies difficult readings daily. With the exception of 2 philosophers, he makes understanding difficult-to-read passages a breeze. Tests are take home, quizzes open book. However excitement of class discussions depends on your class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	3	5	761512	11/9/09	4 tests, 3 of which were take-home. You never knew when he'd hand out a test because of his disorganized nature, but you get a week & they're all straight out of the reading so time was never an issue. Lectures broadly covered the material and went into several philosophical sidebars. Take if random discussion is your thing; avoid if it's not.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy	101	4	3	5	4	761512	10/21/08	A great, great teacher. Has a fantastic teaching style. He has a great sense of humor that makes being in class and participating a joy. It is true his test are lenient but the lack of emphasis on the grade makes me want to sit, listen and interact all the more instead of trying to memorize everything. I would take him again in a heartbeat
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Suits	4.3	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	1	761512	2/1/06	Easy grader, makes the class interesting. Definately take him if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Sutherland	4.0	2	Engineering		5	4	5	1	1251627	11/9/09	Attendance not required. Guy essentially reads you the textbook, class is on a huge curve to start with and curve magnifies as quarter goes on because Excel isn't permitted on any exams (but is allowed for HW, figure that out). Very helpful if you have questions, cares about his students & wants them all to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Sutherland	4.0	2	Engineering	598	4	3	4	3	1251627	1/30/09	Good teacher. He is a little boring and drags on at times but he is very helpful. He is easy going and laid back. Great teacher to have in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	514	3	5	5	5	107680	2/13/13	Sutton is awesome. While more philosophy (not totally my thing) than politics, I nonetheless loved both classes I had with him. He articulates brilliant ideas in fun ways. I think I used parts of my brain I've never used before. Grades generously if you take adequate time to work through the 2-4 assignments. No in-class exams. Readings optional.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	1	Political Science		2	3	3	3	107680	11/10/11	He's funny, typical Australian accent, but it seemed like he didn't have all his thoughts prepared for Con Law. he definitely knew what he was talking about, but he is very opinionated and it takes 2 classes to get a lesson down pat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	513	4	5	5	5	107680	1/19/11	If you have any interest in political science or philosophy take Sutton's classes. I've taken three and every class is amazing, by far the most stimulating classes I've taken here.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	2	5	5	107680	11/20/10	I had the privilege of having him as my professor in my first quarter of college. He's brilliant, sarcastic and enlightening. My interest has taken a much more politically philosophical turn. Already registered for another class for him next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	4	4	107680	2/17/09	Good god, this guy is by far one of the professors going. The course itself is ok, but becomes immensely entertaining with Sutton. The humor he uses gets his point across to a level that other teachers can't attain. If you have any slight interest in politics or law, take a class with this guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	211	3	5	4	3	107680	4/28/08	he is by far one of the best teachers i have ever had. he will introduce humor to make concepts more understandable. if you don't know something go to his office hours and he will help you through it all!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	107680	2/7/08	If you're at all interested in politics take this guy! He is extremely knowledgeable and the funniest professor here. It's a fun and easy class, plus his humor/accent make it all the better. One of the best teachers I've had, definately worth taking anything with him!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	501	2	5	4	2	107680	10/4/07	Awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	5	5	4	107680	4/26/06	If you want/have to take American Politics, make sure it is with this professor. He is Australlian, but knows his stuff, and you will learn a lot! He is very easy going and entertaining. Awesome prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	5	4	5	107680	9/10/05	Amazing Prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	4	3	2	107680	3/12/12	Prof. Sutton is hilarious in that he makes fun of pop culture and really knows his stuff. He worked in the Washington DC before becoming a professor. The take-home exams are painful, but not impossible. Three assignments the whole quarter: midterm, paper (a joke) and a final. Otherwise just reading. Overall I'd recommend him, just pace yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	445	5	4	4	4	107680	5/12/11	I had Sutton for a few classes and he is also my advisor. His classes are very funny and motivational as well as informative. I changed my major to Political Science after I took Political Parties and Voting with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	107680	12/15/10	A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!! A very intelligent yet hilarious man. Gets through to the students and infuses his lectures with quirky analogies and metaphors. One of the best out there!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science	221	5	5	5	4	107680	1/28/10	Dr. Sutton is hands down the best. He's hilarious. I took him at 8 AM in the morning and never fell asleep in his class once. He explains everything beautifully and has downright gut-busting funny stories.Work-wise, it's an easy A. Do your reading and write your papers. I'm taking him again! P.S. Honors is same as regular with him. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		5	5	5	4	107680	11/18/08	This guy is simply the man. Injects humor into the subject and keeps you focused and entertained on what can sometimes be a boring subject. Not to mention that he is one of the easiest graders I have ever had. He is not only one of the easiest A's I've gotten, but also a class which I have gotten the most from. I highly recommend taking him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	4	3	107680	4/16/08	Interesting and entertaining man, often lets a select few take over class discussion to the point where it is a class of 5 people. Will push political views on you but make an effort to convince you of such and will entertain ( and dismiss quickly in course) other points of view.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	5	4	107680	11/2/07	Great professor! At the end of class he deserves a standing ovation. Very interesting, and straight forward. He loves to argue and for you to challenge his ideas. Easy quizzes, take home tests and final. Theres no way you can't get an A if you show up and read the notes he posts. Can't wait to take him again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	107680	1/12/07	Great professor, he's the kind of guy you really want to listen to for 2 hours. Class is usually interesting. He doesn't try to push his political preference on you, which is great given the subject matter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	5	5	3	107680	2/19/06	He he a great teacher! Really makes you think rather than just having you read from a book. He puts good notes on the board and also on mycourses. His Australian accent is alot of fun to listen to as well. He is very reasonable and definately will wake you up at 8am in the winter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	5	5	5	107680	9/3/05	Anyone who cites the Sex Pistols in lecture is ok in my book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	4	5	5	107680	3/7/05	He expects people to particapate too much in class, other then that i learned alot and thought that his test were really easy. He gives EC worth a letter greade for just attending seminars
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	4	5	4	107680	10/21/04	Very interesting professor, he teaches you what yo need to know and some important life lessons (don't do crack).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		5	4	4	NULL	107680	2/18/03	Take him for senior sem! I only had to do three 3-page double-spaced papers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		4	5	5	5	107680	10/25/04	Great Proffessor. Dare I say it, he is an objective CONSERVATIVE. From Australia, so he has tha cool accent and talks about how New Zealanders are not real people. Papers are simple, and you know what is coming on the test. I plan ontaking more classes with him because I am a Political Science minor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sean Sutton	4.6	2	Political Science		3	5	5	5	107680	10/4/04	GREAT Professor, class flyes by, you learn and enjoy it a lot, and if you paid attention in class, the tests and papers are easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	1	Engineering		3	2	3	4	1038077	5/27/09	The WORST Professor ever! His grading is inconsistent and takes 20 points off for not a perfectly straight line. Dont take the class with him. The department should not employee him anymore.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	0	Engineering	361	1	1	1	4	1038077	5/7/09	This professor is completely useless. He teaches directly out of the book. When you ask him a question he rarely knows the answer and tells he will get back to you, but he wont. Be prepaired to learn from the book. His test are very hard, if you do poorly on one test it will drop your overall grade one letter grade. Avoid this professor if possible
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	2	Engineering		3	4	4	5	1038077	10/14/08	This guy really knows his stuff! If you come to class and actually do your work you will do well with this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	2	Engineering	403	3	5	4	4	1038077	5/24/08	Best Prof. in the dept.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	1	Engineering		3	2	3	4	1038077	5/27/09	The WORST Professor ever! His grading is horrible I had to go back to him and point out that my solution is correct and then he would take the exam and "get back to me". He is useless, and not worth my time and money!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	0	Engineering		3	1	2	2	1038077	5/7/09	completely useless. admits he cant use PSPICE, and is therefore no help in lab. literally reads you the textbook. By far the worst professor in the department. I want my money back
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	2	1038077	8/14/08	HORRIBLE teaching style and not helpful at all. Teaches DIRECTLY from the book and doesn't go out of his way to find other ways to explain himself or give different examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charles Swain	2.2	0	Engineering		1	1	1	3	1038077	10/14/07	This guy is not very helpful at all. His teaching style is horrible. He just talks from the book as if you cant already read. If you ask him a question, he may TRY to answer it but he just repeats exactly what you have questioned! Stay away from him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grover Swartzlander	1.3	0	Imaging Science	450	1	1	1	4	1437510	5/18/11	Worst teacher I've had at RIT. This guy could confuse anyone with his questions. Having a PhD in physical optics might not even get you through his tests. Homeworks randomly assigned, no clear expectations on what to do. Final paper is just regurgitation of what you read. RIT PLEASE HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO TEACH THIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grover Swartzlander	1.3	0	Imaging Science		1	1	2	3	1437510	5/1/10	This class is impossible. Labs take hours, and you dont get them before hand. Lectures are impossible to follow. Good luck trying to make your way through one of these tests. The research paper requires 7 sources yet is limited to 3 pages double spaced. Computer projects are very difficult and if you don't know how to program, good luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Grover Swartzlander	1.3	0	Imaging Science	450	2	2	1	5	1437510	4/20/11	Had for physical optics. Tests and assignments are completely incomprehensible. Expectations not clear at all. If you don't already know physical optics, this class will be very difficult, due to him. I really wish RIT had somebody else teaching this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Swiencicki	3.5	2	Writing	227	3	5	4	4	1342766	5/16/10	She is EXTREMELY helpful. Allows an infinite amount of revisions to improve your grade, as she believes "writing is revising and vice-versa." Is fair, and if you have an inkling to write, she is the prof. to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Swiencicki	3.5	1	Writing	101	2	2	3	3	1342766	2/1/10	Hard teacher, snorts when she laughs, loves the nerds. Listen to exactly what she says and write about it. dont try to write what u want, because she wont like it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Swiencicki	3.5	2	Writing		3	5	3	4	1342766	11/11/09	She grades essays pretty hard, but if you ask her to look at your paper she'll essentially grade it for you and give you a chance to redo it. So if you're willing to go to office hours for 10-15 minutes three times in the quarter, it's an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Swiencicki	3.5	2	Writing	227	2	5	4	3	1342766	4/23/10	grades fair, very helpful if you come to see her. LOVES revisions, and allows as many as you want to increase grade! take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jill Swiencicki	3.5	0	Writing		2	2	2	1	1342766	1/10/10	This class is terrible, you do not want this teacher for Writing Seminar, she will kill any respect you have for writing and will make it the most painful research project of your life. She makes one project last all semester, making each part insane, 5 page paper about what your paper will be on, 6 pages about sources etc.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne Szucs	3.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	1272521	10/17/10	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne Szucs	3.5	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	4	1272521	10/25/09	She is a hard ass but its bitter sweet. I learned more from her than any other professor. She is real and you should def. listen to what she has to say. If you work your ass off then you will get an A. But if you are taking photo then you should be working hard anyways.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne Szucs	3.5	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	5	1272521	4/15/09	Professor Szucs is an exceptionally poor teacher. She is spiteful and unhelpful. Based on her actions, it was clear she had no respect for us. She treated the class like 4 year-olds. I walked away from her class thinking she really didn't care. Poor lecturer. If you have an opinion of your own, avoid her at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne Szucs	3.5	1	Fine Arts		1	3	2	2	1272521	2/3/10	Get on her good side right away. Come to class every day and turn everything in on time. Listen to her- she's harsh and tough but she's helping you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzanne Szucs	3.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	1272521	4/22/09	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science		4	2	1	1	67477	11/27/12	Very unhelpful during lecture, skip class and read the slides you're better off. The only thing that matters are the tests. He seems like a very nice guy and may be more helpful out of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	101	3	1	1	3	67477	1/23/12	This man literally sits and reads slides to you. Though some people may learn this way, I do not and therefore learned nothing in this class. Really monotone and boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	208	2	1	3	1	67477	11/8/11	This guy is absolutely awful. He reads his slides word for word. When he tries to do an example. On more than one ocassion he will tell us he doesn't know the answer. He doesn't seem to really know the material. Someone else makes his slideshows and he just reads them to us. I thought I liked chemistry until I came here and had to deal with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	208	3	2	2	1	67477	10/11/11	I am in class at this very moment and I am having a hard time staying awake. This professer simply reads the power points provided by the insanely expensive book, which by the way I have never opened. Whether he knows what he is talking about or not I do not know, but it does not seem like he does. In short, it is hard to stay awake and learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	1	Science		3	2	3	3	67477	11/17/10	He is very hard to get used to, but is a good professor. Reads straight from the slides, but is good at explaining answers on practice tests. Very friendly!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	1	Science		3	4	2	1	67477	1/22/10	Takacs is awesome! You take a TON of notes in the class - most of which you wont understand at all. Exams are based on if you "somewhat" understand the material. He'll help you out if you ask. If you HAVE to take this class - dont be too nervous.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	208	3	1	1	3	67477	1/8/10	He goes through way too many power points each lecture, about 35 slides and rarely gives us time to think during recitation sessions. He says, "ok you have 7 mins to do this part" then asks for the answer in the next min without giving us the full amount of time. Basically I don't have time to process all the info when its thrown at me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	2	Science		4	5	5	NULL	67477	2/10/03	enjoyed his class and learned loads, Takacs is the man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	2	Science		3	4	3	3	67477	11/8/12	Nice old man, but is quiet & boring. Flips through lots of cheap manufactured PowerPoint slides. Extremely helpful MasteringChemistry makes up for it. Dont need iClicker. Takacs is not for the unmotivated student. He will not challenge you, he will only bring knowledge to the table which you then must quickly grab before the next slide comes up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	208	4	1	2	3	67477	11/22/11	This guy is absolutely useless! He says dumb things like degrees Kelvin and water contracts when it freezes. Felt dumber after classes. This guy would be great as my grandpa, not instructor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science		4	1	1	3	67477	11/2/11	This professor simply reads the slides that he does not make himself and does not go over it before hand so that he can understand what he is trying to teach. He makes many mistakes and puts his classes to sleep.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science		2	1	2	4	67477	11/18/10	Reads /only/ from the power point slides. Let students use notes on every test and then a day before the last test said "and remember, notes won't be allowed on the final, all you get is the periodic table, nothing more" if I pass the final tomorrow it will be nothing short of an absolute miracle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science	101	3	1	2	2	67477	11/11/10	Doesnt seem to really know what he's doing. often makes mistakes while doing problems on the board that students have to fix. you basically have to teach yourself chemistry, or at least enough to get by. other than attendance points, theres no reason to go to class. all notes are online. he goes through too many notes too quickly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	0	Science		1	1	1	3	67477	1/22/10	If you take this class, prepare to learn the material alone. Also, he gives us recitation with quiz questions in the end. Then the quiz questions online are different than the questions on paper. He tries to trick you, and the tricking gets old. I would not take a class with him unless I have no choice. He also loves his red laser tag.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gerald Takacs	2.2	2	Science		4	5	4	4	67477	5/21/07	Excellent Teacher. Gives all derivations on the dry erase board. Get ready to write a lot of notes. You won't need all the notes for the tests as the test focuses on the more important derived formulas. But write the notes in a nice bound notebook to reference later in your career as these are excellent notes. Thermodynamics (P-Chem)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	2	Chemistry	262	3	4	4	3	1362031	5/10/12	Dr. Tan has a habit of being a bit rude, but it's just the way she presents herself. She is actually pretty helpful if you need it. The course is tough, but she gives you everything you need to do to succeed. Every test is open book, and you can re-take your tests for you final. Very pleasing on the eyes as well ;)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	2	Chemistry		3	5	3	3	1362031	5/14/11	TOUGH class!!!!! Tan expects a LOT and treats you like an ADULT. Gives you MORE than enough chances (hw, quizzes, exams) to do well. Do the problems with her in class and you will be fine. Extremely patient and answers all your questions in office hours. She's cute and so is her team of TA's!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	5	1362031	2/12/11	She must have inherited her syllabus. She cannot answer questions effectively. Webassign HW/Harris quizzes have incorrect answers and are extremely difficult. Exams are open-book. You will not learn from this class. Memorize the book/examples from the online HW and you will do okay. Hot/nice teacher...BAD professor!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	0	Chemistry	261	2	2	1	2	1362031	3/5/12	The class is very difficult. If you ask questions in class, she answers them very rudely. She goes over the material quickly with little time for comprehension. The tests are open book but that still is not very helpful. And the HW usually has incorrect answers. Altogether, horrible class and horrible professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	2	Chemistry		2	5	3	3	1362031	4/25/11	tough class and the homework sucks, but Tan will meet and go over every question you have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Loraine Tan	2.7	1	Chemistry		2	3	2	1	1362031	3/22/10	She knows her stuff. Rushes through the material and leaves no time for questions. Sometimes come out of that class more confused than I started. One on one she is a great help though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Tarantino	4.5	2	Health Science		4	5	4	3	1691359	2/2/12	Highly interactive and FUN. Very effective teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		5	4	4	5	222864	1/31/07	Prof. Taylor is a very calm gentleman with a fairly interesting class. Materials Processing is sort of boring, but due to lab, it's easy to learn the stuff. Overall, wasn't hard getting a B. And as far as Comp Tools, just figure out what you are doing, and you'll be all set... he's a nice guy though. Have a conversation with him sometime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	222864	10/21/05	the chillest EFFIN teacher from Gleason to Gleason! has his sh*t on locckkkk!!!!no doubt. i pity the fool who doesnt take him. hollatchaboyyyy!!peace, i'm out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	4	2	222864	5/2/05	Very good teacher, fair and lets you out early. Very few easy quizzes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		4	5	5	NULL	222864	6/18/03	good teacher for concepts in manufacturing. Very clear, allows notes sheets on exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		5	4	4	3	222864	7/26/06	I barely did any work for this class and still got an A. He's pretty easy on exams and there is virtually no homework aside from a team project, in which most of the work was done in class. He doesn't like to give points back on tests for questions you definitely answered correctly and he randomly marked wrong, but otherwise he was pretty good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Taylor	4.5	2	Engineering		4	4	5	4	222864	10/19/05	Taylor is the effing man.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	735869	1/28/13	He is a nice guy and tries his best to help. However, the homework, practice problems, and tests are pretty much the hardest questions in whatever area you're learning. The practice problems are very hard to learn from and the exams are no easier.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	4	735869	10/26/12	At first his accent was difficult to understand. After the first two weeks I began to realize it was not his accent but the way he teaches. I went into Calc 2 knowing a large portion of the content and still had difficulty. He gives homework every class that takes longer than other professor's weekly homework. Tests seemed easy but were quite hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	318	2	5	5	5	735869	12/2/11	I took matrices and boundary value problems with him and I liked it so much. His presentation is geared towards application and very clear. I definitely take a course with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	735869	4/29/11	The best instructor I had so far. Excellent and well planned presentation, friendly, easy to talk to. I will definitely take a course with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	735869	1/27/11	the best professor I ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	735869	1/22/11	This professor is absolutely horrible. He doesn't care to do his job. When you ask for help on a problem he doesn't want to help. He never helps during workshops and his tests are so hard that 50% of my class failed. If you want a professor who actually helps you with the material don't take him. I do not suggest this professor at all!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	3	4	3	5	735869	4/30/10	Tekalign is a very nice guy, but isn't the best teacher. The average grade on the first exam was a 60% and was a 56% on the second one. However, he does scale grades differently; an 87% is an A, a 75% is a B, a 54% is a C, and a 45% is a D. He also posts all grades on myCourses and all of the slides that he teaches from, which is convenient.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	735869	10/22/08	He is the best instructor I had so far. Excellent presentation. I did the assigned homeworks, attended class and understood the examples done in class. He gives a lot of examples in class. I am going to get an A in this course. There is no easy A with him, if you are looking for an easy better take a course with another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	1	Mathematics		1	4	2	5	735869	10/21/08	seems like a good guy, but is the worst teacher i have ever had, material is easy in class, quizzes are easy, but tests come out of left field, extremely unfair grader. few if any partial credit points, many have dropped this class because so few are actually passing
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics	305	4	2	2	5	735869	6/2/08	MultiVar was terrible. In the first half of the course, things was alright. But second half, he gave us a take-home exam that was impossible to do without consulting with the rest of the class, and he had us make our own final exam. Even though I consistently scored above average, he gave me a C. I'm never taking a course with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	3	735869	1/24/13	He's an alright guy but I do not agree with the way he teaches. The tests are hard. You could walk out of it thinking you got an A and you will most likely come up with a C. The classwork/homework is too difficult to be good practice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	735869	2/6/12	I took Project-Based Calc 1 with him. He's a good teacher, sometimes a bit hard to understand (has an Ethiopian accent). I didn't think he was that hard a teacher, but many people in the class would disagree (I had previous Calculus experience). Overall, I'd recommend him, he can be fun, and he's willing to help. Cool guy, cool accent, bit hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics	318	1	1	1	3	735869	11/21/11	Worst professor I have had in years, by far! Does not teach and uses power points most of the time. Learned most of what I know from textbook which he didn't use. very unfair grader and doesn't curve even though class average was 69%. The class he taught was Matrices and Boundary Values. DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR THIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	2	735869	4/19/11	Has not homework or quizzes which mean the only grades are his impossible tests. Our class average was around a 50 on the tests and there is only a slight curve. Did not end up learning much at all in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	735869	1/25/11	I love this Professor. His exam is from home work. His presentation is clear and I always know what to expect from the lecture. I do my home work and pay attention in class and participate. I will get A in this course for the first time in Calculus. Professor Tekalign ROCKS. If you are serious about learning calculus take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	735869	11/30/10	I liked him in this course. Excellent presentation, knowledgeable, and he really is a nice guy. I recommend him to anybody who would like to take a course with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	2	5	5	5	735869	3/9/10	He is the best instructor. Clear presentation, friendly and helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	735869	10/22/08	I withdrew from this course merely I am failing because of my fault. He is the best teacher I ever had. His tests and quizzes are from homework and examples we did in class. He is a strict grader but fair. I will take a course with him, I like his slide presentation and teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	3	735869	10/21/08	I agree w/the previous comments. He presents slides in class, and works out a few example, and then tests you on something completely different. expects you to be able to recreate all proof. examples in class are irrelevant test are much harder than they should be. The material is easy its basically properties of matrices and sets of data.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	3	5	5	5	735869	2/6/08	I took courses with him 3 times. He is funny, knows what he is doing and he is an excellent person. If you pay attention in class and do your work on time you are fine. But if you think that you know mathematics (major in mathematics) and pay no attention you will pay the price.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	3	5	5	5	735869	1/31/08	He rocks. I will take a course with him in a heart beat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	735869	11/7/07	Wondimu is AWESOME. He knows math (and other subjects) really well and explains them clearly. You're used to his accent within the first 1 or 2 weeks. He is really funny but also challenging. Fun class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	5	5	735869	3/30/07	The best professor I have ever had. Knows his stuffs, extremely helpful, down to earth guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	281	3	5	5	5	735869	10/25/06	He is the best
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	3	4	4	735869	2/9/06	I had this guy twice in a row. While at first I was very disappointed I started to realize that I learned everything he taught and got an A. His tests and workshops are VERY hard but he curves it, don't be mad when you get tests back and the class average is a 60% because he's not going to fail everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		2	3	1	3	735869	11/29/05	He is terriblr at teaching. He knows lot pf stuff but can really explain it properly. His teches unnecessary stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	1	Mathematics		2	2	3	5	735869	11/13/05	He's an ok guy, but his teaching skills could use some work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	1	735869	10/27/05	This instructor teaches straight from the book, but somehow manages to screw that up somehow. Just stay away.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	3	5	5	5	735869	12/10/07	awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics	283	4	5	5	5	735869	5/20/07	One of the best professors in the department. Cool, down to earth guy, smart, knows his stuff. Took a course with him changed to another, people told me "best" professor, never liked him. Came back to Wondimu, the best professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	4	735869	2/12/07	Wondimu is awesome. He always is willing to help when you dont understand something, and he really seems to know what he teaches. the accent can be kind of hard to understand at first, but its easy to get used to, especially when you have him for more than just one quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	735869	6/8/06	The best professor I ever had. Strict but fair, very helpful. He knows his stuff very well. Unless you are attentive in class, it is useless. I saw some complaints about him which are unfair. He really works hard to convey the idea. He gives a lot of examples in class. If you have a chance take him. But you have to work hard to earn a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	735869	2/7/06	Horrid teacher, reads directly from the book, the tests are not on what we are doing, and he can't answer the workshop questions he gave us in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	735869	11/22/05	He has a thick accent that makes him impossible to understand. He dictates only the book. Any questions he will be unable to answer. He told us that for tests, whatever the class average was is a C, and you would base your grade upon that number. This was in fact a lie, and thr grades we really got were immensely different from what he had told us.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	735869	11/9/05	This professor sucks. I can't understand a word he is saying and the test have nothing to do with the class work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wondimu Tekalign	3.5	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	2	735869	10/24/05	this guy teaches straight from the book, but does a worse job at it, his tests don't have much with the examples he gives in class. His tests are unneccessarily hard. And his workshops just plan suck, only if your a professor can u get it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Teremy	3.2	2	Anthropology	101	3	5	5	3	1255383	4/6/09	This professor is awesome. Very Interesting and Fun Class. She is very friendly and approachable.I would take an other class of hers if offered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Teremy	3.2	0	Anthropology	101	5	1	3	4	1255383	2/17/09	the class was very easy but a complete waste of time; I felt that I learned nothing; If you have a four hour class, you normally get out early; If you want to get a liberal arts out of the way take it but don't expect to learn anything from it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Teremy	3.2	1	Anthropology	101	5	2	3	3	1255383	3/2/09	Easy class but the teacher makes quite a bit of false references. Do not have to stay for the class as she doesn't care if you leave. No need to buy books as there's a copy of them in the library and she reviews everything before the quiz. Exam is very easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	1	Psychology		2	3	2	1	1441800	2/19/13	She does not care how well you adapt to the class or not. She does not care how busy you are with your life. Her grading is horrible. In the last week, she decided to drop "points" from my weekly quizzes which brought my letter grade down from B to C. She could care less that I tried hard to study and to pass her 20 question quiz in 20 mins. Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	2	Psychology	446	5	5	4	4	1441800	9/15/11	She was a great teacher, really made it easy to pass the course if you payed attention. Would def take another class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	2	Psychology		3	4	5	3	1441800	10/12/10	Tessier does assign a lot of coursework, but about half of it is online discussion. As long as you are able to keep track of homework and submit it on time, show up for lectures, and study the book for exams, it's easy to get an A/B. Offers extra credit. Is flexible if you show effort and talk to her. I'd recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	1441800	12/13/12	Love this professor! She's really nice. I had her for an online psych class, and there is a good amount of work expected from you. But as long as you skim the textbook and participate in online discussions thoughtfully, it's easy to get an A. Hope to take her again!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	2	Psychology		4	4	3	4	1441800	10/20/10	She is a really nice teacher. You can tell she knows the material, but she is not always cocky or confident like many professors. As long as you show you care, and make an effort in class and discussions, it's easy to pull off an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Suzan Tessier	3.5	0	Psychology	514	1	1	1	4	1441800	5/11/10	Worst teacher ever way too demanding, thinks she is nice, but in reality there is nothing you can do in any of her classes to honestly earn a good grade (and we are talking even a B). Take her only if you feel like doing more work than the classes that actually matter and get graded the harshest you have ever been.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	0	Business	220	2	1	2	3	1041655	11/20/11	Tests were out of the book, in class discussion was off topic & hard to follow. Did hardly any hands on examples in class, only 2 virtually unguided projects gave us actual "experience" with what we were learning. Didn't give any feedback, only a number grade. Said he wasn't changing how he was teaching after giving him feedback.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	0	Business	562	1	2	1	2	1041655	1/31/09	Adv. Corporate Financial Planning - EXTREMELY HARD. Be prepared to dedicate 20 or more hours a week for this class. I will only recommend this class for students who enjoy working in groups and under A WHOLE LOT OF STRESS. If you hate being confident in your work and hate having a sense of accomplishment, then this class is for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	2	Business	359	4	5	5	4	1041655	3/30/08	Great professor... highly recommended!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	0	Business	505	1	1	2	5	1041655	2/27/10	Adv Corp Fin plan. Class is 100% presentations. Never hands back anything in class or shows you how he grades. If youre one of his favorites in class youll get an A. Everyone else gets a B. 15-20hr of work a week outside of class. He doesn't actually teach the class might as well be an independent study. He just asks questions during presentations
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	2	Business		2	5	5	4	1041655	10/14/08	best professor of RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Testa	3.4	2	Business	562	2	5	4	5	1041655	3/30/08	Advanced Corporate Financial Planning & Analysis - VERY good class. Challenging and TONS of fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	2	Biology		2	5	5	5	1251585	3/25/13	If you aren't interested in the class, don't take it. He expects you to actually learn, and that's what college is for. Excellent teacher and has a great accent, like Mr. Eko!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology	101	1	2	1	4	1251585	3/27/11	Very intimidating. Took the first test and he LAUGHED at the class after they handed it in!! Test true/false questions are ridiculously difficult- be prepared to study every single slide to do decently in the class (aka I studied an entire week/flashcards/the whole nine yards and only got a B on the test).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	1	Biology		1	4	2	4	1251585	10/10/10	Everyone likes to complain about this guy but it boils down to one thing. You came to college to work hard and learn, and that is all he expects. You want to learn take a class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology	412	1	2	2	4	1251585	5/11/10	I had him for Parasitology Spring 2010.He is a ridiculous grader.The worst thing is,he tells you on the first day that he doesn't give out A's. The material is interesting,but he expects your test performance to be at graduate school level.I will never take one of his classes again.I suggest you only take this class if you want your GPA to drop.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology	201	1	2	1	3	1251585	8/5/09	I had him for molecular bio lab and he's probably been the worst professor I had at RIT. You cant understand him and he never gives anyone above an 80 on a lab report unless your 4th year and you already know everything. He most likely gave out one A to the entire lab section so if your looking for an A in lab you better be the top student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	2	Biology	312	1	4	4	5	1251585	10/20/11	Dr. Thomas makes you LEARN for your grade. Yes, you have to read the book for better clarification, because the subjects he teaches are difficult. I had him for Parasitology as well, which was more intense than his Immunology class. Overall, I would recommend his classes because once it is all said and done, I feel confident in that subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology	101	1	1	1	5	1251585	1/12/11	The worst professor I have ever had. Doesn't lecture at all, simply tries to give you life lessons. Horrible tests. He constantly contradicts himself. Complains about teaching at RIT. Be his pet and you'll get an A, be a student and you'll get a D.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology		1	1	2	4	1251585	9/17/10	Sped through lectures, spending more time talking about he family and his trips to Africa than the topic. Ended once class with a tirade about how we should all abstain from sex and how his fife had done so so he loved her more for that. Incredibly awkward, tests were ridiculous, avoid if at all possible. Made me hate the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	0	Biology		1	1	2	4	1251585	10/21/09	This professor made me hate the field of microbiology in reference to parasites. I cannot stand his teaching style. He expects too much to be remembered for the exams and they are practically impossible. He will run out of time and skip over 15 slides then expect you to know this information on the exam. NEVER TAKE HIM - I cannot stress this enough
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bolaji Thomas	2.5	2	Biology		4	4	3	4	1251585	1/30/09	i had him for a friday bio lab at 9 and he made it funny. his accent is kind of hard to hear but you get used to it and he tries to speed everything and get you out early. also helps when the procedure gets hard. i recommend him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Erin Thomas	5.0	2	Theater		3	5	5	5	1485455	1/27/11	Awesome teacher! Take her if you have a chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1480756	10/29/10	Easy A! Love her, great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	2	Business		5	4	5	5	1480756	10/14/10	Great teacher, an easy A, she's so flexible with grading. Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1480756	10/12/10	An easy A and a very good teacher!! Take her classes! You'll never be bored!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	2	Business		5	5	5	5	1480756	10/19/10	An Easy A and FUN! A++++++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	2	Business		1	5	5	5	1480756	10/12/10	Great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Charlotte Thoms	4.4	0	Business	284	3	2	2	3	1480756	10/5/10	Professor Thoms is a nice lady and making us laugh. But her teaching skill needs to improve because she has not been lectured so much. She tends to keep us quiet in the class for two hours. She uses high expectations from her students. A lot of work. But it would be easy to get A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	2	Science		4	5	3	4	66031	3/9/13	He is a very interesting professor. He's very erratic, and has a weird sense of humor. He can be quite unclear sometimes, but if your high school physics was ok, there wont be too much of a problem. He really tries to help you get better marks. One of the better physics professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	0	Science	313	2	2	1	1	66031	11/21/06	Horrible professor. He is very nice as a person and wants to help, but he is really terrible at teaching. He goes on and on about theory and VERY little application and he forgets and repeats topics, so u do the same problem for two classes. VERY disorganized. ALL labs were due LAST DAY of classes... RIGHT before exams. I never learned so little.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	1	Science		2	3	3	4	66031	3/9/06	He's basically a white Steve Urkel, the ultimate nerd stereotype. On the other hand, he's one of the best Physics teachers at RIT, allows test corrections, and will put off lab due dates until they cannot be turned in. He's not great, but he's a lot better than others. He wastes time doing proofs aso you can sleep through those.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	2	Science		4	4	4	4	66031	2/22/05	He is one of the better physics teachers. Takes the time to explain things to the class and go over them. ALLOWS TEST CORRECTIONS!! You can get 60% of your missed points back after corrections. I would take him again if I could. He's a little on the dorky side, but fun none the less.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	2	Science	412	5	5	3	5	66031	5/24/11	Taught E&M II at a very high level. Followed graduate textbook we weren't assigned. Fortunately, he's willing to go very slowly and the assignments were generally very easy. After Barton for I, this class disappointed me, as I didn't take that much E&M knowledge from it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	1	Science	311	4	3	2	3	66031	11/4/06	Nice guy, but unorganized, especially with due dates. During lectures he emphasized theory and long winded explainations rather than simple explainations. He is more relaxed on grading than most professors, and does try to help his students though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	1	Science		3	4	1	3	66031	2/2/06	this man is crazy. he's probably the nerdiest person I've met in my life. He's like Bill Nye except not cool. If no one understands assignments, he'll keep putting them off. Tests are much easier than anything we do in class. Uses WAY too many variables in math problems before substituting numbers in, making it very confusing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Thurston	2.9	0	Science		2	3	1	NULL	66031	4/24/03	This guy is crazy...it only took me one class to figure it out. Easy to understand if your Albert Einstein. But he's nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics	101	1	1	1	1	338650	6/18/08	WORST teacher I've ever had. Incredibly boring, scared of her own classes, obnoxious sense of humor and completely unable to answer student's questions. She knows the concepts but cannot explain a thing to save her life. The tests are BEYOND tricky-- 15 kids dropped the 1st day alone and another 10 withdrew. DO NOT TAKE HER YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics	101	1	1	1	4	338650	5/1/07	horrible teacher, it was my one of the biggest mistake takin her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	2	Economics	211	3	5	5	5	338650	12/7/06	Good teacher, extremely helpful after class, lots of practice questions to help with exam.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics		2	3	1	1	338650	2/8/06	WORST TEACHER EVER. Speaks at a pace of 3 words per minute. I failed EVERY test because I could not comprehend anything that came out of her mouth. Got an F in the class, emailed her complaining, she gave me a D. AVOID THIS LADY LIKE THE PLAGUE!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	1	Economics	101	3	3	2	4	338650	2/7/07	terrible. before this class, i actually liked AND understood microeconomics - now, neither! she is a nice person, however that does not make up for the fact she can't answer a simple question when put on the spot. too many notes and tests were sometimes worded tricky. just glad i'm done with the class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics		2	2	1	1	338650	2/9/06	Nice person, but boring as anything. I do unbelievably poorly on tests even when I pay attention and read the book. Nothing she says registers in my brain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics	401	5	2	2	5	338650	4/4/05	Class is extremely easy. If you only want an A then take her, but dont expect to learn much or be able to stay awake for the 2 hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Samia C. Tavares	2.2	0	Economics		2	2	2	4	338650	2/20/05	Very slow going and boring. Needs to create some excitement in the classroom.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	2	Science		4	4	5	5	66032	1/28/13	Dr. Teese is a good guy and tries to bring some humor to physics. He explains the material well and then gives practice problems on it and comes around helping you with the problems. I would recommend anyone take his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	2	Science		3	4	4	2	66032	5/20/11	Nice guy, different sense of humor, but that adds to making the class more interesting. Explains things fairly well. Has lots of patience which helps when you are a new to the course. Clear to understand. Show commitment and you'll gain respect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	2	Science		4	3	4	4	66032	5/13/10	This professor is actually very clear in his lectures. If you can stay focused and listen to him he does explain things clearly. He gives you tons of example problems and he drills it in your head. He is much better than the professors that just talk theory all lecture and dont give you anything to work with. I dont know how you could fail
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	1	Science	311	2	2	3	1	66032	4/21/09	Don't expect him to teach you if you're in 311, as you're supposed to be dependent on your group. The only thing he does is hand out worksheets. He spends more time helping out individual students one at a time than the class, but that means you just have to wait two hours get help on something. Not a bad guy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	1	Science		3	2	3	5	66032	2/3/07	Very dry in teaching, unlikely to provide useful help in class.... better luck getting help from the TA. Not a horrible person though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	2	Science		4	5	5	4	66032	2/28/06	Good professor. Boring at times, but better than others I've had. He tries not to talk too long so you can work in groups. I understand everything he taught.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	0	Science		3	1	1	NULL	66032	5/19/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	0	Science		1	1	2	5	66032	1/22/13	All he does is hand out worksheets and tell you to do them. He does not present the material at all for the class, but rather relies on online material that you have to self teach. Do not take this class, I love physics and want to be an engineer but this class changed my mind. Teese loves shaft
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	2	Science		3	4	4	2	66032	5/13/11	I personally loved him. He explains every topic very well before we go and do problems on it. His has a dry humor which can be refreshing at times for such a boring topic like physics. Many people would say that he isn't good, but it isn't his fault. Physics is a hard subject to teach, and he does the best compared to other UP1 teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	0	Science		2	2	2	2	66032	3/3/10	This professor is horrible. i failed his class and now it ruined my GPA. i went to his classes as much as possible. i took physics 1A and the extra day was no point. DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN AS A PROFESSOR!!! he does not help you and does not care to fail you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	1	Science		4	3	3	3	66032	2/10/07	The best advice is to not take this class at 8:00 if possible. Dr. Teese doesn't really grab your attention, and if you need help with something, he'll just tell you that you're a future engineer, so figure it out yourself. But luckily, our TA wakes up from the dead to "help us". "Help us" as in calling Bob Teese over. The tests aren't bad though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Teese	3.0	0	Science	311	3	1	2	3	66032	10/17/06	Does not teach. Expects us to learn material and finish web assigns on new material before class, then puts us through the lectures on the material we just self-learned. Relatively easy tests. 85 class average

Rochester Institute of Technology	David Templeton	2.0	0	Chemistry	206	3	3	1	3	1287064	5/15/09	His teaching methods are all right. The most incomprehensible about him is his sign language skill. I guess it is lousy. Also his listening skill to students' sign language is weak. There are some communication barriers in the classroom especially deaf students!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	456	4	5	4	4	715380	10/23/12	Funny and charismatic professor who is very knowledgeable on Ancient Philosophy(456). Come to class, do the assigned reading, and contribute a little to discussions and you'll do fine on all assignments as most of them are just "textual mastery" or basically making sure you grasp what's in the reading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	210	5	3	4	4	715380	3/13/12	If you go to class and do the assignments you get an A. But beware she DOES NOT accept late assignments at all, not even for partial credit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		2	4	4	3	715380	1/17/12	A great professor. Always kept lectures interesting and intriguing. Assignments for this class may require some time due to the amount of readings she assigns but they aren't hard, about average. Tests/Quizzes were from her lectures and readings, so as long as you do what you are assigned you should be fine. Would definitely take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	4	715380	5/13/10	Clear, interesting, helpful and very, very approachable. More intelligent than she lets on. Class was enjoyable and thought-provoking. Makes her love of Pink Floyd and BSG known (as another reviewer wrote, "she is leet cool"). In short, a great Professor to work with. Oh, and... this class was challenging but rewarding. :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	2	715380	4/21/10	She is an AWESOME teacher. She is smart, funny and makes the class interesting. No book required. She puts all packets or online links that you need to read on mycourses. You barely have to read b/c she goes over everything in class. She makes Philosophy easy to understand. Def take her class!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	4	4	715380	2/9/09	Smart, funny and entertaining professor most of the time. Goes off on a lot on tangents -- but they're interesting so that's good. I'd say it's only a fair and honest observation that she has a mean streak (in a way that's distinctly feminine and snide) -- but she's normally gentile and very supportive; it's only when a student is way out of line.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	500	1	5	4	3	715380	1/8/09	She is BY FAR the best instructor at RIT! Actually she is one of the very best I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	5	715380	5/19/08	very cool person great teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	3	5	5	3	715380	5/1/08	Perhaps the best teacher at RIT. I cannot say enough good things. Extremely knowledgeable, intelligent, funny, articulate, and helpful. I needed help and found out that the professor was more than willing to help me with my question during her own time. Some people in class have issues with some of what she says...they need to grow up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	715380	2/6/08	she is leet cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	4	715380	4/27/12	Best Teacher I've had so far. Don't need to read much at alll as long as you pay attention in class. Shes funny and hot. tests aren't bad, theres a couple 1 page papers that are easy peasy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	715380	2/28/12	She's an awesome professor. Her main goal is to keep you interested in the topic, which she does a great job at. Lectures are easy to understand and assignments are easy to fulfill.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	715380	5/18/10	Great class if you are looking to fulfill a liberal arts requirement or looking to explore philosophy. Her quizzes and exams are fairly easy when you do the ready and attend class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	715380	5/3/10	KT is BRILLIANT. Very knowledgeable and an excellent teacher. Readings are challenging but not difficult. Quizzes and tests are no problem if you've done the reading and paid attention to her lecture. Her lectures are super-interesting and she is absolutely hilarious. This class requires effort, but I emphatically recommend it for anyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	715380	2/10/09	VERY interesting, funny, exciting. I look forward to class. Assigns reading, but not necessary. EASY EASY TESTS. SUPER EASY QUIZZES. FUN CLASS whether you like Phil or not. Prof is awesome. Take this class for your Liberal Arts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	4	4	4	715380	2/5/09	Interesting discussions, extremely intelligent and quite a babe. Essay assignments are SO EASY is you actually read what the question is asking of you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		3	5	5	5	715380	6/1/08	She brings out the excitement in the material. Really, cares about teaching, but willing to make it fun. Kindof strict about writing and harder tests. But overall Just great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	5	715380	5/18/08	GREATEST PROF I'VE EVER HAD! Not afraid to be controversial u can see below how stupid the reactions can b from kids afraid of it. Some are obviously scared of a smart woman. She's amazing and so much smarter than offended brats its fun to watch but mostly she just teaches with passion, intellect. RUN TO HER if you arent afraid TO THINK!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	1	715380	2/11/08	She is very funny, but discussions about each subject last way too long and tend to bore. also, majorly passive-agressive. haha watch your back.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	509	4	5	5	2	715380	2/5/08	i love philosophy...Now i do
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	509	2	5	5	2	715380	2/1/08	She is a great teacher, smart, clever, funny, cute, the full package. Keeps my interest but sometimes I find myself just staring at her beauty and I find I didn't even hear what she said. She dresses very nice and has a cute voice that is really easy to listen to. Its nice to have such an attractive teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	4	715380	1/30/08	AMAZING! Honestly I never thought any professor could hold my attention for two hours straight, but KT proved that theory wrong. With strong, impressing, bold statements and arguments, she sparks class participation, and stays unbiased. Her intelligence, humor and personality make her attractive, but to say she was not good looking would be a lie
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	402	2	5	5	5	715380	11/24/07	Yes, she's hot, very hot. But she can also teach. My first class as a freshman I learned a lot, but now after three years of all types of class,a couple more with Terezakis, I realize she is the best teacher around. Sometime she is very serious, sometimes very funny and she really, really knows her stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		2	4	5	5	715380	11/7/07	To say this woman is hot is to fall worlds short of accurate. When socrates spoke of eros he had katie in mind. He wouldn't touch Alcibiades but he'd have suffered banishment from Athens gladly for Katie. After all his years of questioning he finally posited as true beyond doubt only Katie's hotness. Also she is smart.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	509	4	5	5	4	715380	7/16/07	Terezakis is a BRILLIANT philosopher and an inspiring teacher. She is probably a GENIUS, but she is so clear and charming that you'll never feel left out of lectures. I could never adequetely sum up how much I have learned from her. Just take anything she is teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	5	715380	1/15/07	A very good professor. Her classes were interesting and we learn a lot.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	210	5	5	5	5	715380	2/1/08	This professor gets her message across by using fantastic imagery and practical examples. Her wonderful sense of humor keeps the class light and interesting. She can be tough when she needs to get everyone's attention, but quickly turns the mood with her humor and continues to teach. She definitely deserves a big raise in pay. One of the best!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		4	5	4	4	715380	1/8/08	She is a good prof that will hold your attention not only by her looks for the guys but also by her strong teaching skills. She is very understanding and when I took it she offered out of class sessions to talk about the topic futher if anyone wanted.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	400	1	5	5	5	715380	11/22/07	Incredible prof. Take anythings she's teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy	300	2	5	5	3	715380	7/17/07	My 4th class with KT, who is the greatest teacher I've had. She has a gift for making dry, hard arguments fun and relevant. Humor++; great love for philosophy and very caring w/her students. Readings are hard and papers tough, but she is fair w/grading. Also, don't even try blowing off class b/c you'll fail but you won't want to miss it anyway.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	4	715380	7/11/07	The best teacher I ever had at RIT. She knows her stuff, bes usre to show up to class just to hear the converstaions and lectures she gives, their excellent knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Katie Terezakis	4.8	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	715380	11/21/05	She is one of the greatest professors I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	202	2	5	5	2	287565	2/2/10	The best professor I had in college - no joke. Undergrad, grad and certificate programs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	801	5	5	5	5	287565	12/5/08	I took 2 classes with this guy! He is great. Pick him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	801	4	4	4	3	287565	12/5/08	Part of the Executive MBA program. Great professor, with a lot of insight into the real business world. Makes accounting sound interesting and presents real-life dilemmas and challenges.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	0	Accounting	101	2	1	1	4	287565	5/14/08	Horrible professor, does not teach!!! Exams ask for completely biased answers. DO AVOID! (if you have a choice take EVANS)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	703	2	4	4	4	287565	2/17/06	Good professor - take good notes - go to class - very staighforward. Great depth of knowledge about the real world. I would take another class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	0	Accounting		1	1	1	1	287565	2/1/05	he sucked. dont take him. he is incredibly impossibly hard, and his tests are impossible too. he teaches 10 secs every class and leaves, he has NO notes, he has NO handouts, the book he uses to teach is BAD....THE WORSE PROFESSOR EVER, DONT EVER TAKE HIM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	801	2	4	5	4	287565	11/20/09	Fantastic class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	802	5	5	5	1	287565	12/5/08	Fantastic Prof - learned a lot and the classes were fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting		2	4	4	4	287565	10/8/08	Great Professor, if you do the reading and pay attention in class you should not have a problem. He is very concerned that the students learn and leaves a lot of time for questions. I would definitely take this professor again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting	802	3	4	5	4	287565	2/8/07	Dan is very engaging during class. He did a terrific job of moving the discussion beyond the text and into the business world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting		4	5	5	5	287565	7/18/05	Great teacher very knoweledgeful. His test are easy if you read the book and ask questions in class. He gives NO HOMEWORK OR QUIZES. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dan Tessoni	4.0	2	Accounting		4	5	4	NULL	287565	11/15/03	Very down to earth guy with quite a bit of knowledge. I'd love to take another class with him :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ian Tewksbury	1.0	0	Computer Science		4	1	1	1	1279642	4/30/09	Attendance is required, which sucks, not bad grader, plays youtube video at the end of class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	1	Science		5	3	2	4	97505	3/27/12	Prof Thireos is a nice guy but his long-winded, off-topic rambling mangles his simple lesson plans. He tries to make the information approachable but ends up teaching the course at a glacial pace, wrought with unclear instructions. Read ahead to get the most out of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	1	Science		3	3	2	2	97505	1/25/12	Took him for computers in medicine. He is the sweetest guy and really cares about medical informatics. However, extremely boring and gets way off topic during class. Quizzes and tests were very specific so you really have to study the notes! He alo is greek and tells us how every little word is derived from greek so that gets annoying after awhile!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science	310	5	5	4	5	97505	10/23/11	Thireos is the man. He loves medical informatics and loves talking about it even more. He's pretty goofy, but he makes the dull material pretty fun. He is very approachable and is always willing to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science	217	1	5	2	5	97505	2/18/10	I agree with below poster, but Thireos is a super nice guy. Problem is,theres a ton of material jammed into 10 weeks. It goes from easy to insanely difficult very quickly, and only eperienced programmers will find it easy to do. I hate this class, but its not all the professor. He'll give you tons of homework extensions to help you out.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science	218	5	5	5	5	97505	10/27/09	Great professor, he writes programs with the class so you have something to look back to while doing the PEs, and HWs. He is a fair grader, and he gives extra credit if the class needs it overall. I ended up getting over a 100 on one of his exams because he curved it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science	218	4	4	5	5	97505	4/29/09	Very friendly guy. His age holds him back expecially when it comes to getting back your tests, he woudl be lost without his TA. For the most part he is a good teacher and funny too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		5	5	5	5	97505	11/19/07	Hands down my favorite professor! He WANTS his students to do well so he's always offering help/extensions/reviews. Easy quizzes based mostly on memorization. Always gives review sheets before tests (covering about 99% of what's actually on it). Big on attendance-- his pet peeve is when people skip. Genuinely sweet man who loves to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		3	5	4	4	97505	11/29/06	At first you think he doesn't know what he's talking about, because he talks like we've never used a browser before. Then he's REALLY picky about your answers. The quizzes were unusually hard and based on memorization. The labs were easy. Make sure you study for the tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		5	4	3	1	97505	2/3/05	Class is easy and he is willing to take time for students if help is needed. Has a tendancy to get off topic, which can be confusing. If you know too much about computers, you may not fair well bc he is very set on his own ways. He loves to teach and he really does care. An all around Good Guy:)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	1	Science		3	3	3	3	97505	1/30/05	Meh, OK prof. very very nice guy. very very set on his own ideas, and wont like yours. Don't try to answer a question in your own words. Or write a program your own way. even if it works, and may work better than his examples, your answer or method will be unacceptable and wrong..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science	230	3	4	5	4	97505	1/29/12	Notes and discussions were thorough and you can learn a lot if you pay attention. He often goes out on a tangent but it's not boring and the material gets covered. Tests/quizzes is more based on rote memorization than understanding of the material, but given the subject I'd think it would be hard to do otherwise.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		5	5	4	4	97505	11/9/11	Good teacher imo
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	0	Science		3	1	1	4	97505	4/27/11	This is his first time teaching this class and why? because he only learned the topic this summer. He doesn't know what he's talking about and I literally learned the whole subject from the TA. HE should've been teaching the class. Not the mention Thireos is sooo boring and so confusing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	0	Science	217	1	1	1	5	97505	2/1/10	What a nightmare. We're half way through the quarter and half the class is pulling out their hair trying to keep up and dreading each exam. He has homework based on material that he hasn't covered yet, and exams that have unexplored answers. The exams, by the way, are entirely based on memory, so you'd better learn where EVERY little bracket goes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	0	Science	220	4	1	2	2	97505	5/5/09	Not very good at communicating with his students. I sent him about 15 emails this quarter and only got two back. I went to his office hours and was turned away because his leg hurt. He depends on the TA a lot, you're almost better off talking to the TA instead of him. Pretty dry lecture as well. Oh, he wastes A LOT of paper on useless handouts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	1	Science		2	3	3	3	97505	11/4/08	Doesn't completely understand the material he's teaching which makes it incredibly difficult for the students to either. Moderately easy weekly exercises and painful weekly labs. Goes through the material much too fast so unless you're a cs major, a lot of this is hard to grasp. Very flexible on deadlines but stay away if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		3	5	4	2	97505	12/3/06	Great professor. Down to earthm and likes to add his own take on things. VEry funny also.. Yes he likes to go on a tangent at times, but it all comes together in the end. Very willing to help if you need it. He wants his students to succeed in life. I recommend him to all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		4	5	3	3	97505	11/7/06	Very nice guy, tends to get way off topic and talk past the end of class. Willing to help and set up review classes. Long tests, but easy if you study. Will review for a quiz five minutes before and basically give you the answers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		4	4	3	3	97505	2/3/05	Class is very easy.. He is at times, hard to understand with his greekish accent. Very fun to argue and debate with, even though you will not get your way. But all in all he is a good guy, and a good prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	2	Science		3	4	4	NULL	97505	10/22/03	the nicest greek man alive!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	0	Science		5	2	2	NULL	97505	9/10/03	Will not shut up, and talks about random stuff and always repeating himself. Trys to help if he is capable. Nice enough guy, not that great of a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Nicholas Thireos	3.4	1	Science		5	3	2	NULL	97505	12/12/02	cannot ever stay on topic, helpful but not exactly the best teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	0	Mathematics		2	3	1	1	1627573	4/11/13	The only reason I understood anything was because I took calc in high school. He is not a great teacher and cannot explain things clearly. His tests are also pretty hard and he takes questions from the textbook that he never went over in class. The only positive is that he does offer frequent office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	2	1627573	11/26/12	He understands the material himself, his problem comes from the fact that he hasn't yet found an effective way to impart his knowledge to his students. The homeworks are the quizzes, but the content on them is far more difficult then whats taught in class. Office hours are generally a must if you want to keep a good grade. Exams are quite hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	1	Mathematics		1	4	2	3	1627573	11/18/12	I attended all classes, all review sessions, and frequently went to office hours and I still did not do well. His homework assignments are incredibly hard and the exams even more so. If you aren't great at math, working hard and doing the work isn't going to be enough to get a good grade in this class. The exams are so much harder than expected.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	2	Mathematics		2	5	2	2	1627573	10/23/12	Has tons of open office hours, really approachable, but a poor teacher overall. He isn't clear on most things and falls behind on work often and has to play catch-up at the expense of the student's understanding. Teach yourself Discrete, then come to class in order to succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	2	Mathematics		1	4	3	2	1627573	11/30/11	He is extremely difficult in comparison to all the other Discrete Math for Tech teachers, but he does offer a lot of help and he makes it pretty clear when he explains it during the office hours he offers. You are going to have to work a lot harder than anyone else in the same course with a different professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	0	Mathematics	205	1	3	1	3	1627573	11/20/11	Great guy, but he is an extremely challenging professor. Course work is very difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	0	Mathematics		1	3	1	3	1627573	2/11/13	Goes way too fast and covers more than necessary! Tests/Quizzes much more difficult than expected. Unless you go to every office hours and spend your free time in the Bates lab, you won't get close to an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	4	1627573	11/24/12	This class isn't easy but he will help you if you ask, quiz every Friday and a good amount of studying to be done before every exam. A lot of office hours but still a tough course if you're not a math person
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	1	Mathematics	205	2	3	3	2	1627573	10/29/12	He's a nice guy, but isn't the greatest teacher. When I do understand a concept in class the homework and exams are usually 10 times harder.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	1627573	2/22/12	Great at teaching. You will learn a lot from him. He will do anything you ask grade-wise like making a test take-home (even the final!), dropping old grades, making questions optional etc. However, don't expect this to make things easy. The take-home tests are extremely hard. It started boringly easy, then he got behind and it got hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	0	Mathematics	205	1	1	1	2	1627573	11/21/11	He is a good guy who is easy to get along with and he knows the material. The problem is he is a new teacher and does not know how to pass his knowledge on to the students. I would avoid this teacher if you can. To pass his class you need to get lots of out of class help. HE IS A VERY DIFFICULT TEACHER!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher Thomas	2.8	0	Mathematics	205	2	2	2	3	1627573	11/15/11	Professor Thomas is a great guy, but not a great teacher. I took his discrete Math for Tech 1, and I was unable to grasp anything throughout the semester. He does not give enough examples during class. He also give you homework that goes WAY beyond what he teaches you. He is one of those teachers where you have to learn the material yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		4	4	4	3	986069	1/30/12	Really knows her stuff.Friendly, nice, and helpful. Not really necessary to do the reading, she covers what you need to know in class. If you need to take art history, make sure you get her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		4	4	4	2	986069	5/26/11	Nice lady. Committed to teaching you, even if the information can be a bit boring. Not too tough - only three essays and two take-home tests. I'd recommend taking her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		2	5	4	1	986069	9/27/10	Boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring....................almost impossible to stay awake. Knows her stuff, but you wont be awake to hear it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	101	5	4	3	3	986069	2/18/09	Very nice and friendly. Understanding teacher who is willing to work with you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	101	4	4	5	4	986069	1/4/09	nice and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	123	3	5	3	4	986069	6/9/08	good class, you have to keep up. she's nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		5	5	5	5	986069	12/3/07	she's really great. in class and out. entirely helpful with questions. the exams are easy, as long as you go to class. She's very organized and is interested in her material... which is important.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	1	Art History	123	3	2	4	1	986069	5/2/07	soooooooo boring. it's so difficult to stay awake in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		3	4	5	3	986069	10/21/11	She is such a sweetie. She is really easy to understand and she tells you in advance what to study. She doesn't give lots of homework or quizzes. I highly recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		5	4	5	3	986069	10/25/10	Nice lady. Teaches by slide shows, so it can be boring. Two tests and one essay, other than that, just lecture. Tests are easy as long as you study. Very nice about answering questions
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History		3	5	5	3	986069	5/16/10	She is very helpful and clear with class content. The syllabus is straightforward. All exams are take-home and manageable. She is very understanding to those who aren't majoring in Art History who still have to take the electives.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	123	4	4	5	2	986069	1/29/09	Great teacher. Super nice, too bad art history is boring as hell.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	101	4	4	5	5	986069	10/16/08	This class is one you've got to keep up with, but it's not difficult to do so. Just know what's going on, go to class, and do the assignments and you'll have an A no problem. She's very nice and knows her material really well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	123	2	4	5	4	986069	5/19/08	Good professor- she knew the material forward and backwards and told stories to keep it interesting. A lot of memorizing, but it was pretty straightforward. Take her for any class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sarah Thompson	4.3	2	Art History	123	3	5	5	3	986069	10/31/07	She tells a lot of interesting stories about the art. Really organized and knew a lot about everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	2	Engineering	785	5	4	5	4	22209	2/15/13	Found the class to be straightforward, exams were likewise, fairly easy. Course focused more on slides rather than book material. Good professor, entertaining, would def. take a class w/ him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	1	Engineering		4	2	4	3	22209	11/17/11	Should try harder to teach the classes and add more material. Half of every class contained a summary of the last one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	0	Engineering		5	1	3	5	22209	6/20/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	2	Engineering		4	4	4	NULL	22209	4/14/04	Hard course, very fun, and very reasonable teacher, adjusts requirments to meet class accomplishment
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	1	Engineering	790	3	3	3	3	22209	11/23/11	He is a good professor, but his exams and quizzes are extremely tricky, and sometimes, even him gets confused with the questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	1	Engineering		3	2	4	2	22209	2/9/11	did not feel like a graduate level course. expect more efforts from him in terms of teaching.course structure is good. the content is found lacking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	1	Engineering		3	2	4	4	22209	11/29/04	His grading system is horrible!!! The tests are usually arbitrary and aren't really fair. It's hard to test knowledge of C++ without using a computer. His final was confusing, but he was an ok teacher, i learned a lot. The final project is also horrible, most ppl probabally spent 72+hours on it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Thorn	3.0	0	Engineering		3	1	2	NULL	22209	12/13/01	If you are in his clique you are set. If not watchout. His finals are confusing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English	227	4	4	5	1	954694	2/25/13	Robb was one of my favorite professors so far and is extremely easy to get along with. He tries to include everyone in the class and takes time to get to know everyone. He made the class enjoyable and we had fun discussions about real issues in society.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	4	4	1	954694	3/16/12	Definitely the coolest professor I've had so far. I looked forward to going to his class, and I hate writing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	5	4	1	954694	5/16/11	Nice guy, funny, entertaining, approachable
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English	101	3	5	5	1	954694	8/9/10	Took Prof Tillett for Arts of Expression and writing seminar. He is by far the best writing teacher i have ever had. Loves what he does and makes writing class fun (which i never thought was possible). He is THE MAN!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	4	5	3	954694	12/1/08	Great!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	4	5	2	954694	10/23/08	The Man
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		4	5	5	2	954694	2/18/08	Great teacher. Reading due every class but is quite interesting. A couple of papers but not huge deals just make sure you do them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		2	5	5	2	954694	10/8/07	Best English teacher I have ever had. Take his class!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		5	3	5	5	954694	1/31/07	Robb is a great guy. He's a very laid back teacher, and his class was downright enjoyable. If you are a harcore literary genius, you may be disappointed with his class. But overall, he grades easily, jokes around, and has fun in his class. Definitely a good teacher to lighten your work load.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		4	5	5	3	954694	2/4/13	Rob Tillett is the most insightful, funny and smart teachers I've ever had. Always having fun and having really engaging conversation of the material. No question best writing seminar teacher at RIT. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		5	5	5	3	954694	11/10/11	Great guy, lots of fun. The type you'd grab a beer with. The course focuses on argumentative and persuasive writing. The course book is full of really interesting prompts that were easy to respond to at length. In class discussion was interesting. Totally worth taking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		4	4	4	1	954694	2/2/11	I have no interest in writing whatsoever, and I actually looked forward to going to his class. He is very funny and easy going. We only did 3 papers the whole quarter. My favorite teacher at RIT so far- he is definitely THE MAN
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	5	4	5	954694	7/22/09	Great teacher, he can be pretty sarcastic but it's all good-natured. His class is always interesting, and he triggers some pretty interesting discussions during class. You'll write about 3 papers, but you know plenty of time in advance and the topics aren't hard. TAKE HIS CLASS!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	5	5	3	954694	11/18/08	great teacher, gives plenty of time for hw, relates to the students, funny.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English		3	5	5	5	954694	10/22/08	Awesome teacher. Deals with serious content but keeps the environment light and funny. He earns respect of all of his students with a fresh and helpful teaching style and hilarity.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English	101	4	4	5	3	954694	12/3/07	One of the best teachers I've had. Period. He's not an easy A by any means, but if you do what he asks and try your best, you'll do well. Not too many assignments, but he expects you to do them. Homework requires only an hour or so per class, and weeks you have papers only take an hour or so extra. Excellent teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rob Tillett	4.6	2	English	101	4	4	5	5	954694	9/6/07	Very cool guy, colorful language and a joy as a teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josephus Tisdale	1.4	0	Economics	440	2	1	1	3	923153	4/29/09	Horrible teacher. No interaction. Would recommend removal. Answered one email rudely and offered no help. Needs to do something else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josephus Tisdale	1.4	0	Economics	211	4	1	2	2	923153	11/6/07	No video lectures like other online courses (not sure if this is his fault?). Useless when responding to questions, which he does in a rather harsh and snappy manner. Overall, not a nice guy either. He told a student whose cousin was murdered during the weekend of a test that he "wasn't sure what he could do" about letting her retake it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josephus Tisdale	1.4	0	Economics	211	3	1	1	3	923153	11/10/08	Microe class. This professor is useless. On line learning. Entire class depends on reading book with no lecture material to clarify. All homework and project in teams with indication he monitors participation in each team however lack of participation is not penalized. Does not answer specific questions. Changed procedures numerous times
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josephus Tisdale	1.4	0	Economics	211	3	1	3	5	923153	11/21/06	Refuses to read email that does not come from RIT's network, responds to questions in a very harsh and snippy manner. I would have had an A but he never responded to a clarification about my homework grade by my group leader and thus I got a zero on the assignment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Tomaszewski	5.0	2	Information Technology	740	3	5	5	3	1690332	1/30/12	Great Prof, His class will make you learn a lot, but he teaches it well. Great guy too, helped me outside of class more than once, and got me to get myself an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	153304	10/20/11	He was my favorite professor at RIT because of his ability to present the material in an understandable way. His classes moved at a good pace and were always the most entertaining. His grading was fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	153304	11/29/09	Terrible. Cut class for two weeks after winter break, haven't seen him since. He was probably fired, and if so, he deserved it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	153304	11/25/08	Horrible teacher, all over board with notes, not considerate and harsh. A mean teacher and just overall a jerk. Doesn't answer questions well and doesn't teach well. Find another teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	2	Engineering		2	5	5	5	153304	8/30/05	By far the best professor in the ME dept. had Emath1,2 continuum mechanics, non-linear dynamics, and analytical mechanics with him. Very cool... super intelligent
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	2	Engineering	701	4	5	4	5	153304	10/11/10	He is one of the smartest and best professors in ME
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	0	Engineering		1	1	1	1	153304	7/17/09	worst professor I have ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Josef Torok	3.3	2	Engineering		2	5	5	2	153304	5/30/08	One of the smartest and coolest professors on campus.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephanie Townsend	4.5	2	Psychology		3	5	4	1	1082928	12/26/07	Prof. Townsend was an adjunct professor who came in only to teach this class. She did so very well. As long as you are willing to put forth the effort in the class, she is willing to guide you along. This class is mandatory for Psych minors, and I had no interest in it whatsoever, but she actually made the course interesting and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Trager	5.0	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	1566160	4/20/11	Awesome teacher. Easy to communicate with sign/oral. If you have any questions related to programming, just stop by his office. If you want a good grade, just show up early and finish your lab before class start. I took him for Programming Fund, great class to start with before I entered Java 1. He was strict about academic study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		5	5	5	4	479785	4/7/13	He's the best professor ive had when It comes to notes. Very neat and clear, and he posts them all online. Tests are easy, mastering physics is short. No quizzes, only 2 labs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	369	4	5	4	3	479785	11/9/12	Great Guy. Really Helpful!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	1	Science		4	3	3	5	479785	5/21/12	I don't like his teaching style but he is a great physics professor. Drops 2 quiz grades and a lab grade (labs are in class and there are no lab reports). Tests are pretty straightforward. Gives lots of opportunities to improve your grade (very lenient). Take him if you want a somewhat easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	369	3	5	5	4	479785	5/18/12	Awesome class- my only class I actually look forward to. Prof is clear, and easy to understand. Never opened the text, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	369	4	4	5	2	479785	2/24/12	He's awesome. One of the best physics teachers at the school. He knows what he is talking about and takes everything slow to make sure everyone understands.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	5	479785	2/1/12	He is amazing. I never though I would enjoy his class. He is clear he's funny. The homework he gives is tough but he gives you 20 tries on mastering physics! ( no point deducted). So you alway get a 100. His quizzes are easy he tells you the problem so you can look it up online and just study that. He's amazing. I learned so much!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	0	Science		2	2	2	3	479785	5/27/11	He is simply doing his job. Does not seem very passionate or encouraging to students to try their best effort in physics. He lectures at a fast pace that anyone left behind has to catch up later. HW is fair, quizzes are fair (at least he mentions what will be on the quiz), the exams...not. He does not review b4 exam, mentions topic the day before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	389	4	5	5	4	479785	4/14/10	I had him for phys IIA and he is definitely the best physics teacher I have had at RIT. He is very straight forward and brings in a lot of tangible examples. He is really helpful outside of class and loves his homeland of Canada.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	5	4	4	479785	11/7/09	Great professor. One of the best Physics teachers at the school, hands down. He is pretty clear about most things and stuff that isn't clear you can just ask him and he's a great help. Funny too- always throws in jokes somewhere. I highly suggest taking him but learn the Canadian national anthem first- it will come in handy, trust me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	3	5	5	4	479785	4/1/09	Great professor! He is available to help students and will spend time explaining things. Posts stuff online! I would take his class again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	3	479785	1/30/13	Given the way RIT lets you select physics classes you're probably stuck with a certain one. If you have Trayling consider yourself lucky. He's a great guy and knows his stuff. He goes on some tangents, but they're interesting and helpful. His diagrams are OUT OF THIS WORLD and easy to understand. Puts notes online as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	4	4	3	479785	10/25/12	One of the best physics professors at RIT. His class is pretty easy and he's good at teaching the material. Tests are pretty easy, quizzes are really easy and he drops the lowest 2 scores (out of 10) and drops the lowest lab score (out of 3).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	5	5	4	479785	5/19/12	Great guy, awesome teacher. He makes everything crystal clear and you will always be prepared for the quizes/tests if you pay attention. Very lenient grader also.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	4	5	4	479785	3/6/12	Awesome professor!! He knows his stuff and gives really good examples in class. His quizzes aren't too bad, and there's about 1-1.5 hours of Mastering Physics per week. His tests are fair if you study (going through his lecture notes which are posted online really help). Really funny guy too and willing to help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	369	4	5	5	3	479785	2/6/12	Major improvement from my last physics teacher. Physics takes some getting use to, but Trayling makes it easy because he's not at all sadistic and won't try to trick you on major exams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	3	5	5	3	479785	10/9/11	Great prof. He loves physics and it shows! Spends a lot of time helping students who need extra help. Would recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	2	5	5	4	479785	5/10/10	Great prof! Loves to use demos in class! Physics is fun!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	389	5	5	4	4	479785	2/19/10	The best Physics prof in the department. Nuff said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	5	4	4	4	479785	5/27/09	Trayling is a great professor. He explains things well, and does lots of demos. He is one of the few good physics professors at this school.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		3	4	4	3	479785	3/9/09	A breath of fresh air. Not your typical belittling, arrogant physics professor. Lectures are laid-back and straightforward, labs are helpful, grading is fair, and his class is actually enjoyable. I'd take another class with him in a heartbeat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		1	4	4	2	479785	3/9/08	Good prof, very patriotic to his Canadian homeland. All the course material and notes are available on his website which is very useful. does move pretty quick so don't fall behind. physics is always gonna be a tough course, but he is always willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	4	5	4	3	479785	3/2/07	Great professor. Labs and Webassigns are designed to make you learn, not to kill your grade - most people get 100%. Final is worth a lot (30%) and a bit more difficult than the regular exams (probably because it's a common exam). Fun class- played music from a laptop and joked around during labs and he's ok with it, as long as the work was done.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	5	5	4	479785	1/31/07	Prof. Trayling is a very enjoyable professor; for my money, the all-star of the physics dept. at RIT. He's very relaxed and very knowledgable. As long as you pay attention in his class, you will both enjoy it and learn a lot. The tests are difficult, but only because of the subject matter. Take Trayling if at all possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	312	3	5	5	4	479785	10/31/06	best physics teacher at RIT, 20 attempts on webassign questions, all notes from class put online, won't give below a 70 on labs, helps with webassign.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	4	4	4	479785	11/9/05	I really wish he was teaching Physics III because I would take him in a second. By far the best Physics teacher at RIT; no doubt. He often does examples in class, that are nearly identical, if not 100% identical, to the questions on the test. Also, if you do poorly throughout the quarter, but do well on the final, he discounts the other stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		2	5	5	4	479785	10/14/05	This guy is awesome. He is a total different breed of physicist, cause he's Canadian. All jokes aside, I would recomend this prof. to anyone. He incorporates fun exercises into the class periods and likes to joke around. If you don't understand something, don't worry, he'll make sure you understand it before he leaves school that day. A+++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	311	3	5	4	4	479785	5/23/05	Good prof! He has interesting demos and likes to spice up the class with the occasional corny joke. LOL He does know his material and is willing to help students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	1	Science		3	3	3	3	479785	5/4/05	This guy is a particle physicist from canada, so believe me, this university physics stuff is definitely beneath him. That explains why he flies through a lot of the material without really stopping. He's probably the best teacher of the bunch, but expect a fair amount of out of class preparation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	1	Science		3	3	2	4	479785	1/30/05	If you need someone to really explain facts to you dont take his class. Very difficult to follow him. Nice guy but very unclear with his teaching. Unless you can manage on your own... take someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	0	Science	312	2	2	2	3	479785	2/23/08	Very difficult to keep up with him during lectures. He flies through material because it makes sense to him. Very ignorant and demeaning to those who don't understand the material. Only pro is that he posts everything on his site (worksheets, lectures, exam solutions, ...). I would recommend him over other prof's, but he's definitely not the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	5	5	5	479785	2/14/07	Amazingly knowledgeable in physics and able to actually explain every step of the concept clearly. There is not a better professor in the physics department. Tests had good coverage and were hard if you didn't understand the core concepts of the section, but they were easy enough if you do. Also funny and has lots of stories
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		2	4	5	3	479785	11/1/06	Best physics professor period. I did bad in physics 2 but I cant blame it on him. He presented the material fairly, tests were fair. Webassign and labs still exist but they are actually helpful in his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		3	5	5	5	479785	9/19/06	Dr. Trayling is one of the best professors at RIT. He spends time helping students and always has notes ready for students on the webassign. I wish he was teaching all of the physics classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		4	4	3	4	479785	11/7/05	I walk out that class with the same knowledge when I first start the term. He is very easy professor, fun and lab are also easy. However, he went through the materials really fastm you have to do some reading on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science		5	5	5	5	479785	9/19/05	Even though it is true that he flies through the material, he makes you understand it the best way possible, simple and plain. He posts his notes on-line, which helps a lot. He's definively one of the best teachers. He knows what he's talking about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	2	Science	311	3	5	5	4	479785	5/13/05	Canadian Physics Rocks! I was sorta worried that I'd be so lost in this class. Friends told me horror stories about their profs. Its alot to cover in one term so it goes fast, but Dr Trayling was always available for extra help IMO. It helps that he's a bit of eye candy. Makes class more interesting
Rochester Institute of Technology	Greg Trayling	4.3	1	Science		3	3	3	3	479785	2/18/05	Expects you to pick up things quickly and doesn't explain very throughly. Test questions are sometimes unusually hard and/or vague. A pretty good teacher besides that.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	321251	12/4/07	You will always be remembered here in RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	2	Engineering	300	2	3	4	3	321251	5/1/07	Had him for Tech Programming I and II. HE's not an easy teacher, he expects you to read the chapters he assigns, and he grades strictly. That being said, I learned a TON in his classes. He is helpful but has little patience for students who aren't prepared for lab or class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	0	Engineering		2	1	1	4	321251	10/30/05	Not helpful at all. Sometimes he dont even know what hes teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	1	Engineering		5	3	2	3	321251	10/22/04	Horrible teacher - inconsistant terminology. Easy class (you won't get past simple things like arrays and pointers in this class). Very confusing when he speaks. VERY nice guy, but nice doesn't cut it when you need to get a good grade. Luckily I already knew C++ when I got there.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	2	Engineering		2	3	4	3	321251	10/23/07	Prof Trippie is not going to baby you like your in high school. Got an A in his class. If you can't seem to find the answer after exausting all of your resources he will help you, but not before then. He asks for things a certian way and if you dont give it to him that way it will reflect in your grade. He's a really nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	0	Engineering		3	1	1	1	321251	10/30/06	Uhh this guy is horrible he probably is the worst. He doesnt help kids when they ask for help unless you are really advanced. The only reason kids do well in this class is they have done programming before. I read the book and try to do the assignments and he is like a freakin robot spewing out the same text from the book. screw this class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	321251	12/2/05	The reason people hate this prof. is because he expects you to learn on your own in a lower level class. Get used to it, he is a great professor and teaches well.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Trippe	2.4	0	Engineering		1	2	2	2	321251	10/16/04	He is extremely hard. If you don't do things his way exactly as he wants it, then you won't get real far in his class. Seems scary at first but once you get to know him, hes really not that bad.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Gill Tsouri	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	534	3	5	4	4	1535736	6/21/11	I took this course and found it to be well taught and interesting. Dr. Tsouri presented the material clearly and was always willing to answer questions even beyond office hours. I especially liked how he put things in the context of current technologies. The quizzes were a bit hard and he is not an easy garder, but fair overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gill Tsouri	3.8	2	Electrical Engineering	101	3	5	5	4	1535736	1/27/11	Had him for Communication. He was a big part of the reason I took computer networks as well. Has a good sense of when students are confused and doesn't move on until they understand. Really cares about students getting the stuff. Very clear teaching style and extremely helpful in and out of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gill Tsouri	3.8	0	Electrical Engineering	534	1	1	3	1	1535736	5/3/11	This is the worst class I have taken at RIT, mostly due to Tsouri. Initially, he stated weekly quizzes (9 quizzes=60% of the grade) would be given based off the homework. This was a blatant lie. The quizzes were loosely based on the homework at best. He also doesn't present material clearly and never shows where he gets his equations from. Avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business		3	5	4	4	1165129	5/18/12	Had him for Database Systems Development. Great professor. Made sure that the students learned the material without basing grades on the final product, but on the process. Made sure there was time to help students if needed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	270	4	5	5	5	1165129	2/2/11	Real nice guy. Hands on class, helpful teacher. Really learn a lot and I looked forward to class . Got by without the book. Show up to class, do the easy hw assignments and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	440	4	5	5	5	1165129	5/22/10	0112 - 440 Database Systems Development. Great professor. Very interested in students' success. Explains material very well and helps with with problems. He is very friendly and supportive. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	1	Business	101	3	3	3	2	1165129	2/3/10	Annoying class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	102	5	4	3	3	1165129	5/5/09	A good prof... made a boring class fun with goofy jokes
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business		4	5	3	2	1165129	2/2/09	Professor Tu moved quickly during class examples, but as long as you pay attention and stay off of the internet and resist from playing solitaire, this class was easy enough to understand. He's also EXTREMELY nice and really helpful outside of class. He's pleasant!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business		4	5	5	5	1165129	3/25/11	Amazing Professor! Took him for Database Management Systems and Database Systems Development! Everything is Hand On...not much work...looks for effort over accuracy..challenges your logic and makes sure everyone fully understands the content before proceeding! He even waits for a student if he is late from break! Loves teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	390	4	5	5	5	1165129	11/17/10	Very good teacher. Has a good heart and cares about success of students. I would recommend him to anyone. His class was FUN.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business		5	4	4	2	1165129	2/8/10	Good prof. Super hawt!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	390	5	5	5	5	1165129	11/16/09	A+ teacher! Explains things very well. Extremely helpful. Wants everyone to learn. Very kind and friendly. Gives curves!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	1	Business		2	3	3	1	1165129	2/14/09	Knows what he's talking about, but can't express it well. Sometimes hard to understand. Expect to never get straightforward answers from questions. Will meet with you outside of class and help you a lot with your work, but can be unhelpful. Expect difficult tests, and impossible homework, but most of the time they are open-book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Q. TU	4.2	2	Business	101	4	4	4	4	1165129	8/14/08	Dr. Tu is very organized and clear on what homework/assignments are expected and is also very helpful in class when asked questions. I think he understands that Business Software Applications is more geared towards helping students learn how to use business tools and grades very fairly accordingly. Do the homework and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	0	Art History		1	1	3	1	899795	11/10/11	Hey kids, do you like slideshows?! You'd better. Not only are the lectures slideshows, but the tests are slideshows. You have to memorize the names and locations of art, with way too little focus on the concepts and practical implications of art history. Good if you like memorizing stuff. 3 tests, each with slide IDs, short answer, and essay Qs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		4	4	5	4	899795	1/25/11	She knows everything about her field it seems. Easy to do well if you read, pay attention in class, and take good notes. You can get alot out of this class if you put the work into it and listen to what she has to say. It seems like she has a lot of real world experience and has worked a bunch of museums. Very knowledgeable and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		2	4	4	2	899795	12/26/10	Her class was tough to get through. Her tests are tough - too tough for a 3 credit course, but she is very understanding and a very nice woman. In all reality, I deserved a C/D, but after talking with her at the end of the quarter I got a B. She is extremely knowledgeable so if Art His is your forte - definitely take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		2	3	4	4	899795	11/1/09	Actually, her tests are difficult. She does NOT give you the essay ?s beforehand - idk why someone said that she does. Strict grader. You lose more points for writing something incorrect than you would for not writing anything at all,which is BS. She is one of those art historians that has to validate her BS degree by taking herself way too serious
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History	225	4	4	4	4	899795	8/13/09	Great professor! Her tests are strictly slide memorization and essay writing. Although you might not think that you need to go to her class, she always gives you interesting and useful information to use as your slide information and essay answers. Sitting through a 3 hour class is tough, but she tries really hard to get to know all her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History	101	4	4	3	2	899795	2/1/09	She's boring at times but her tests are super easy if you study. Going to class isn't always necessary since she gets most facts straight from the book. She usually goes through notes too fast & her powerpoints can be disorganized & confusing, but it can all be found in the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History	101	2	5	4	2	899795	11/15/07	I really thought she was an interesting teacher...very helpul...once you get a hng of the first test, its pretty much cke for the rest of the time. Just be ready to read...shes big on the textbook
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		4	5	5	1	899795	8/23/07	Great teacher. If you come to most classes and pay attention for a little while you can ace the tests easily. Just concentrate on when she actually defines somethinga dn you're good to go. She gives study guides out. She will go out of your way to make sure you pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	1	Art History		3	3	2	4	899795	11/9/11	I had the 6-9 PM class fall and winter quarter and it was so hard to stay focused. Her lectures were alright, and her accent is funny. She definitely knows her stuff and is a sweet lady. The tests are difficult because of the memorizing, but if you can manage to stay awake in class and take good notes, you'll probably do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	0	Art History		1	2	2	1	899795	12/28/10	Had her for Survey. She was very bare bones and straightforward, and the course just boiled down to mindless memorization. Considering this is a mandatory class, and most of the professors are awful, I'd recommended her. You at least KNOW what will be on the tests beforehand, unlike other profs. British accent will make you lol.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	1	Art History	308	1	3	2	2	899795	5/11/10	Had her for Art Interior. & Furniture Des. BIG mistake. I did more work for this class than my 4-5 credit courses. Had to drive around and take photos then write a TWENTY PAGE PAPER about them. Had to do a PP presentation, and her quizzes were stupid hard(like it was intentional). RIDICULOUS amount of work for a 3 credit course. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		2	3	4	3	899795	9/28/09	The text book is really important. Making flashcards is a really good idea. She gives you all the resources you need to get an A, you just have to put in the work. She gives you the essays before the test so you can practice writing them out. She also gives a thorough slide list. Also, for the record, her British accent is real.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	2	Art History		5	4	5	2	899795	2/4/09	Her tests are super easy, if you make flashcards with the pictures on them and go to class and half pay attention you will get an A. The flashcards are super important though, they aren't due or anything, but are a major help (also a pain at times).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	0	Art History		1	1	1	1	899795	6/20/08	FAIL!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	0	Art History		1	1	1	3	899795	10/24/07	Western Art was really hard. 3 hour night lecture and fake british accents are just too much too handle. Power Point presentation completely. Might as well stay home and read the book, which by the way, is the size of a small child. Useless teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Tice	3.1	0	Art History	101	3	1	1	2	899795	10/12/06	Bad news bears. SO borring, and you don't do anything besides memorize random facts for tests, take the tests, and forget the facts. Lamassu.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	5	5	5	4	234854	1/24/13	One of the best math teachers I have ever had. Take her if you can. Her classes fill up quick. she explains everything really well and is willing to help you with any questions. Very patient and has a great teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics	226	5	1	1	1	234854	11/30/12	I honestly don't like her. She's one of those teachers who teaches out of the book, and not by knowledge. I feel she knows her stuff but doesn't know how to teach. She also keeps reminding you that "If you're in her class, then you don't know the material" in a condescending way. It's INFURIATING coming from her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	273	4	5	5	3	234854	6/21/12	The best Calculus teacher I had this year. I wish I had her for my other calc classes. She explains everything really well and will help with any question. Take her if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	319	5	5	5	5	234854	5/12/12	Clear, friendly, and fair. Afraid to push the class to a high school or college math level. Often insultingly easy. But I blame the math department more than Timberlake.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	234854	2/1/12	She is legit one of the nicest people ever and a great teacher. If you can not get a passing grade in this class you're probably lazy and don't do anything
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	216	2	4	4	3	234854	11/28/11	She was a fantastic teacher. Very approachable and always trying to help. One of the best math teachers i have ever had. Her tests are not the easiest but she drops your lowest grade. She wants you to do well in her class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	234854	11/12/11	GREAT TEACHER. GIVES A LOT OF HW, THOUGH.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	2	234854	7/12/11	The best calc teacher I've had. Failed it before with another teacher. Timberlake made it so easy to understand. I wish I had her first. Take her if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	206	3	5	5	4	234854	3/7/11	She is the best. Very helpful and clear. Great notes all of which are posted online. I wish I had her for discrete 1. Take a course with her, you won't regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	234854	12/1/10	I love this teacher. She is sweet and very willing to help students. Her class had an easy pace and I found it very easy to follow topics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	2	3	4	2	234854	1/2/13	Nice lady - seems to know enough to teach the class. Math will be math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	2	234854	10/11/12	Nicest professor I have! Really helpful, wants to make sure you know your stuff, and wants you to succeed. I had her for Calc for management science, but I already took calc in high school so the class was extra easy for me. But even if you've never taken calc, you shouldn't have a problem as long as you listen to her and follow her examples.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	319	4	5	5	2	234854	5/12/12	Nicest professor ever. She is the best, by far my favorite professor so far. Any thing you are unsure of she will go over until you understand. Take a class with her you wont regret it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	226	4	5	5	4	234854	2/1/12	She is the nicest teacher that I have ever had. Very helpful and wants to make sure everyone understands what is going on. Drops the lowest quiz and test grade. If you fail her class you seriously must have been trying to do it on purpose. Highly recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	234854	11/28/11	Great teacher, very clear friendly and willing to work with students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	4	234854	11/12/11	Her students' success is important to her. She always makes sure the class knows what's going on, which is helpful if you're a little lost. Tests are fair and often a bonus question is provided that can boost your grade. As good as a calculus class gets.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	4	234854	11/3/11	She is a great professor. Always ready to help. I have her next quarter too. Do your hw and you'll get good grades on the tests
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	205	4	4	4	3	234854	3/16/11	Easy teacher, but you need to pay attention. The class is basically impossible to fail because she drops your lowest test and replaces it with your final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	2	234854	1/25/11	Good professor who gets her point across without going too far out of her way. Compared to the other professor I had last quarter, she is an amazing professor for discrete math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	205	4	4	4	1	234854	11/13/10	A relatively simple teacher, but she teaches what she likes, not what is really useful to computing. She does make the material pretty easy, but will take a while to deliver your grade to you. Lastly, she barely uses MyCourses so be prepared to take a lot of notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	273	5	5	5	3	234854	8/20/10	A great calculus teacher. Take her if you can. Fair grader and always willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	234854	8/5/10	Took for her Discrete2 for tech. Very sweet lady who really cares about what you're learning. I would take her again in a heartbeat if needed. She thoroughly explains material and is nice with grading. Attendance not mandatory, but it can boost your grade if you're borderline.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	1	234854	3/23/10	Holds office hours, answers questions very thoroughly. Biweekly group sessions in which we had to solve 4-5 problems were always a little hectic, though. I did all of the test reviews she gave us, but still didn't do well because the reviews don't really cover everything :( you have to dig through older material / really understand the homework
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	2	5	3	234854	1/20/10	I had a correct answer once, and she totally would not accept it as correct. She lost my respect at that point, then she had to go and say 'impute'.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	234854	10/8/09	She is one of the best calculus teachers I have ever had. I hope I can take her for calc 2. She takes the time to really answer your questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	272	5	5	5	3	234854	4/24/09	The best math teacher i've ever had. makes it so you can really understand it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	206	4	5	5	3	234854	11/23/08	Great class. Hard topics made easy. Took discrete 1 and 2 with Timberlake. She is very helpful in and out of class and very easy to talk to. I recommend her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	1	234854	8/31/08	I took 4 calc classes with Timberlake; she was amazing. I'd made attempts at some of the classes with other teachers and failed. She will hold your hand if you need it, and gives partial credit on tests, etc. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	4	234854	5/21/08	I just finished the course. I learned so much. I actually took this course before and failed. I wish I had taken Prof. Timberlake first. Awesome teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	234854	4/4/08	Extremely nice, and very helpful. Gives fair tests and quizzes. Had her Q1 for calc foundations i, and could really tell that she cared about how well people did in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	234854	8/8/10	Great teacher and very sweet woman. She is very clear in her teaching style and is extremely willing to help after class. She treats you a little like you're in elementary school, but she's great if you don't know the material. Otherwise class can kind of drag.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	234854	7/29/10	She was the best calc teacher I've had here at RIT. I wish I had her in my earlier clasees. Very helpful and nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	206	5	4	5	3	234854	1/29/10	The best. I wish I had her for discrete 1.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	234854	11/26/09	This was my first math class at RIT. She was such a great teacher. Lots of patience and really made sure you understood the material. I'm taking her next quarter as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	3	5	1	234854	10/4/09	I got put in her class by accident because of a goof-up in the offices after I got a 4 on the AP exam....I know all the material and work faster than everyone else in the class by proxy; she's great if you have no or little experience in the subject but if you're coming off an AP, and you already know the material, you're in for 10 weeks of boredom
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	3	234854	1/30/09	Awesome. She is so nice and helpful. Do your hw and come to class and you'll do great. I have really learned a lot so far this quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	205	4	5	5	2	234854	9/12/08	She is a great teacher. This is my first quarter here and she is great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	1	234854	5/23/08	I thought she was a wonderful teacher. I really hate math but I thought she did an awesome job. I would really like to take her again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	234854	4/28/08	This is my second course with professor Timberlake. Very easy to understand. Lots of good examples. She is always willing to help you. Take her if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	4	5	5	4	234854	3/22/08	A great teacher. We are going over review that we should know. Since there are prerequisites for the course, but she still wants to make sure that we know the material. Very helpful, just go see her and she'll help you with any topic. I've only had her for a few weeks but I think she's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	4	234854	3/10/08	She assumes you know a considerable amount going into the sequence. Grades you on things that you don't know yet; overall, a very presumptuous and bad teacher. Also, she's one of the ones that follows the mandatory attendance policy, so if you already know the material, you're out of luck.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	262	3	5	5	3	234854	1/28/08	A great professor. Explains things real clear. Always helps with your questions. Take her if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	261	3	5	5	3	234854	11/20/07	One of the best math teachers I have ever had. Very helpful and encouraged questions. I am taking her again next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	271	3	5	5	5	234854	5/27/07	She is a truly amazing teacher - a rare breed of person - always willing to help. I would highly recommend her over any of the other math teachers especially if you've come through one of Longs classes a little shaken up
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	3	234854	2/25/07	Doesn't explain material very well. Failures to give enough time for quizs/exams, and her answer to help is "Go to the math lab"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	3	4	3	234854	5/10/06	Professor Timberlake is very nice, but the fact is that she is not a paragon of teaching excellence. Her tests are easy, though the software generated review sheets that she distributes may lead you astray if you've been slacking with homework. Class _can_ be stimulating at 8am. Work every night on your homework and you'll do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	234854	2/8/06	She is not bad as she is cracked up to be. Very nice, sweet. She does a -decent- job of teaching the material but learning via homework is sometimes necessary. She can be flaky with myCourses but is very organized in class. Tests/quizzes are easy and she is very forgiving as far as they go (miss a test? get your final exam grade for that test).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	234854	11/16/05	very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	234854	10/26/05	She was a great math teacher! She explains things very well and will keep explaining until you understand. She teaches assuming you don't know any of the information she is going over which is only fair so of course its going to be boring for those who know it already! I've never done good in math but I've earned 90s on all the tests so far.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	234854	2/5/08	Very nice lady-- picks and chooses which HW assignments to collect so make sure you do them. Also takes attendance randomly so it's important to show up. The tests and quizzes weren't too bad- she really wants to see her students do well. The workshops make for an easy grade too-- sometimes a bit tricky but manageable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	272	3	5	4	3	234854	12/19/07	This is the second course that I've taken with professor Timberlake. She is great. You can understand the material and her tests are not hard. Do the hw and you'll get bonus points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	261	4	5	2	3	234854	11/3/07	I personally felt like i was in a kindergarten class the whole time. She speaks down to the students and if you ask a question in class, for the rest of the class she will single you out to ask if you understood what she just said. Very condescending.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	234854	5/25/07	great teacher. Explained everything really good. Answered all questions. Take her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	5	234854	1/19/07	She is more than willing to help, anyone that has suffered through Dr. Long is grateful to have her, I guarantee it. Very kind, comes off as a person instead of a robotic teacher. I personally adore her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	234854	2/12/06	She is like a high school teacher. Very nice and helpful.. and clear.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	1	Mathematics		3	4	2	4	234854	12/2/05	Eh, not bad. Nice teacher. Very easy with grading and tests. But dont rely on her teaching skills. Make sure to do homework so you know whats going on for sure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	2	234854	10/26/05	great teacher. very helpful and supernice! If you struggle in math she is really good at explaining stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	234854	10/19/05	Worse professor I have ever had. She doesn't know what she teaches and has on occasion taught things wrong and holds everyone responsible for it. Don't take this professor if you dont already know the material or want to get through it with minimal effort. trust the book and never her. doubt everything she says and check any lesson against the book
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	1	234854	7/12/05	I tell you- shes not worth having as your teacher. I feel sorry for those of you who enroll into her classes. Her notes, lectures, assignments, tests, and quizzes are HORRIBLE. She even gave out handwritten tests. Who ever does that? Not worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	319	3	5	5	2	234854	3/2/05	Great course. She explains things really well and her tests and quizzes are fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	205	3	5	5	1	234854	2/6/05	Hard course but she made it easy and understandable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	5	234854	10/27/04	so helpful and if you ask questions, she will answer them. shes never snotty
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	4	234854	10/16/04	Very nice but sometimes a little hard to understand. Is a good person to take just make sure you have a tutor on the side to explain things if you don't understand.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	234854	2/24/05	She is the best math teacher I've ever had! She helps you whenever you have a problem and it's the first time I actually got an A in math. Just do your homework, show up to class and take notes and you'll do awesome on the quiz's and test's! She really is a great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	1	234854	11/11/04	She's okay, but goes really fast and doesn't explain certain things well. I found better understanding of the subject at the Academic Support Center.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	3	234854	10/20/04	very nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	234854	10/4/04	She's an awful teacher and doesn't explain the lessons clear enough. Not to mention, she gives unexpected problems on quizzes and tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Helen Timberlake	4.2	2	Mathematics	205	3	5	4	NULL	234854	3/3/04	Great teacher. She really helped me understand the course. I wish I had taken her the first time through.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lilla Toke	1.2	0	English	110	3	1	2	4	1616641	12/31/12	She is not kind person who cooperate when it comes to your schedule & her schedule conflict. She won't give a damn when you go to tutor if you need help. She rather you all not go to tutor for any assignments if you need help, due to her schedule very limited and unavailable on those times. It's very sad. Think about ur expectation of education!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lilla Toke	1.2	0	English		1	1	1	1	1616641	9/7/11	This teacher did not sign language very well, did not explain very clear to the students, and the student is having hard time with this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		4	5	5	3	1060398	3/25/13	Best philosophy professor at RIT and probably most intelligent. Learn a ton every class and grade is just based on an essay and two simple tests. Perfect.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	1060398	4/28/11	Easy class. You can tell he is interested in the material. He is quite entertaining and good looking. There is a decent amount of reading, and some of it can be very dry. Also, there are some lectures that can just be downright painful (think powerpoints). But that changes fast once you get farther in the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	213	5	4	4	5	1060398	10/24/10	He's a nice enough guy, but if you're looking for a real philosophy class stay away from critical thinking. He didn't go into any depth on anything, and he's kind of a slacker (let's the class go early all the time). Two quizes, two tests, all the answers emailed to you. If you want an easy A take it, but don't expect any real discussions at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	1060398	10/29/09	Take his class for Critical Thinking. It is ridiculous. It's soo easy. It has like, two quizzes, three exams, and a paper. He's the man and makes the class. Just take notes and study thru them all. You will definitely get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		5	4	5	5	1060398	5/13/09	This class can turn a moron into an intellectual. Very easy class. Teaches things very valuable for every day life. Excellent professor. Intriguing class. Puts a philosophical spin on just logical errors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	4	1060398	3/1/09	Torcello is a very good teacher, he knows material very well. About five quizzes, three tests, and a paper. He makes the class quite easy! If you are looking for an easy class to fill up Liberal Arts requirements, then take his courses!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	5	1060398	10/30/08	This guy makes me think so much I don't know if I love him or hate him for it ;) jk I love him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	300	3	5	5	3	1060398	4/15/08	Torcello's the best. Take his class. You won't be disappointed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		4	4	5	1	1060398	1/2/13	Good guy and interested in the material. A lot of reading but the textbooks were pretty cheap and relatively readable. Boring class until about halfway through, at which point it becomes very entertaining.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	3	1060398	11/26/10	I honestly don't know about comments about this class being too easy. I tried hard, read everything including study guides, and just scraped into a B, tho I had all A's otherwise. I thought the prof was awesome, very intense, but also funny. hardcore philosophy sometimes, then logic, dubunking. It was pretty muhc the best class and prof I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	509	3	5	5	5	1060398	7/21/10	Great professor, Made Critical Thinking a truly interesting and fun experience. I had high expectations going into the class and they were honestly exceeded. Come to class and your grade will be just fine, better yet, participate in the discussion and an A will be very achievable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		2	5	5	3	1060398	5/13/09	I thought this class would be useless but it was actually the most amazing class I ever took in 4 years.I thought Critical Thinking was obvious but Torch blew my mind. We had totally extreme creationist freaks in class, global-warming deniers, etc. Torch nailed it home but was actually amazingly respect of them, don't know how he did it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy		5	5	5	5	1060398	5/12/09	Everyone should take this class. He teaches you things you can use throughout your life. Teachings are crystal clear, readings not necessary. Tests are extremely easy and straightforward with just 3 choice multiple choices. Watch interesting shows for a couple of classes. Easy A. TAKE THIS CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	210	3	5	5	2	1060398	12/2/08	Awesome guy, had him for Intro to Philosophy last quarter. You will learn a TON of information from this guy, but be prepared to take a ton of notes. His Intro class only had 3 tests which accounted for 90% of the grade and attendance is the remaining 10%. This guy is awesome (rocks out socks and sandals). I am now in Critical Thinking with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	213	5	5	5	4	1060398	4/28/08	Very good teacher. His class is also easy so I'd recommend it to anyone who's just filling in the required liberal arts. He makes class fun and interesting, and is just a good teacher in general. No complaints, I'll take his classes in the future if given the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Torcello	4.9	2	Philosophy	370	3	5	5	4	1060398	11/24/07	This guy is fantastic. He is incredibly knowledgable, totally committed to his material and getting people debating it. He teaches very controversial important issues which I think is rare in his field. Every hour of class is relevant. He is also very charitable and friendly in and out of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing	210	1	5	4	5	1178958	11/11/12	She's a good professor, but she's willing to help students as always! Also the attendance is mandatory! Therefore, she's a tough grader. Well she's one of my favorite professors!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		1	5	4	4	1178958	10/10/10	An amazing teacher who would be willing to give you fascinating books to read over the weekend, and you get to write your own memoir! A cool teacher, take her! Not an easy A, unless you work for it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		1	5	5	5	1178958	5/5/10	Dr. Toscano is one of the best teachers at RIT. She is a very sweet woman. Never arrive late and don't miss a class, it will affect your grade! She has high expectations in the students, be sure you do the work she tells you to do, and you'll be fine. It's not an easy class, but it's fun, interesting and worth the time! You'll read a lot, but A++!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	1178958	12/15/09	she is an amazing teacher, she would be helping you a lot if you have trouble, the lectures are tough, but easy to follow!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	1	Writing	101	4	2	3	1	1178958	10/20/09	Pretty tough, but made her guidelines for her papers pretty clear. Attendance is mandatory, try to sign up for an afternoon class so you don't accidentally sleep in. Writing Seminar is generally a boring course but if you do all the work and show up for class it shouldn't be too hard to get an A or a B. Kissing up to her is super helpful too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	0	Writing	227	1	1	2	2	1178958	2/2/09	She will give you a hard time seriously! If you failed writing seminar before, she will know and she will make your world the worst just to watch you squirm! I broke my foot and she yelled at me for being late! *curses*
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	1	Writing	101	2	3	3	3	1178958	10/21/08	pretty strict, when a student shows up with an incomplete assignment, she makes it obvious to the classroom. forces everyone to show up for class every single day, does not consider your health.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		2	5	5	5	1178958	8/30/05	I had her during my first and second year, she's a tough professor but helped me getting through classes and my papers. She's one of my favorite professor of all times. I'll miss her since I'm no longer a student at RIT:(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	1	Writing		5	3	2	NULL	1178958	6/2/04	Okay, this professor is nice and easy - yes, but when he writes on the board it's just so awful. You can't read his handwriting and he sometimes doesn't specified which problem is which, apart from the others.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		3	5	4	3	1178958	10/18/11	Super nice and loved the class, a lot of reading/writing but she made it interesting and always had the class involved. I highly recommend her if you're a good writer/reader and passed Writing Seminar without much struggle.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	1	Writing		1	2	3	1	1178958	9/19/10	extremely hard as heck!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing	101	3	5	5	5	1178958	1/9/10	can be harsh, but good teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	1178958	12/15/09	LOVE HER!!!!! Take her!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		3	4	3	3	1178958	5/28/09	I had her for Writing Seminar. She is easy if you do the assignments and show up to class. She is very anal about absences though, so don't sleep in all the time. Also, she gave me B's and C's but I got a D on the last paper, so shows how she grades. She is nice though, asks how we ae doing every class day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	0	Writing	227	2	2	2	2	1178958	10/23/08	Worst Teacher I've ever had. If you at all ever differ from her opinion, you just earned yourself a D on your next paper. You have to kiss her butt all the way to MAYBE pass. She teaches the material horribly and you'll get nothing from this class. Avoid her at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		2	5	5	4	1178958	7/12/06	Tough professor, grades hard but helpful. she helps you to understand the material and how to improve the grade. one warning. be sure you have good writing skills along with grammar too or you will get killed easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		2	5	5	3	1178958	2/3/05	i have her for english class, shes tough grader, but at the same time, shes very helpful with students feedback such like that. she gives alot of homework. take her if u want a challenge.i got a B from her so.she isn't that bad if you do all the hws and essays.she helps you alot shes funni sometimes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Rose Marie Toscano	3.9	2	Writing		2	3	4	NULL	1178958	2/19/03	Attendance stickler , esp. if the student's better than other students academics
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	758522	2/1/10	Fragmented Lectures, poor ppt slides, ridiculous amounts of work, endless WebAssign work, online quizzes, discussions, and vocab assignments. Half the class is incomprehensible lecture, with concepts being taught in no context to the other. The rest is group work. Over-reliance on textbook, which isn't helpful. However, allows cheat sheet on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	758522	5/22/08	Very nice and helpful teacher. Not the clearest presentation, but the material speaks for itself. Its very straight forward. fair grader. Data 2 was pretty easy with her so I recommend taking her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	2	Mathematics		5	4	4	4	758522	11/20/05	Had her for Design of Experiments. I enjoyed the class very much and thought the presentation of the material was excellent. I recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	1	758522	10/27/08	She's very nice and helpful, but sometimes when she writes in emails and assignments, you'll notice they're typed kinda funny. English is most-likely not her first language. But it's still been a good experience with her. I would recommend her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	1	Mathematics		4	3	2	3	758522	2/14/07	Heavy reliance on powerpoint slides and TI calculations. Using TI made the class easier at times, but her slides we just a jumble of formulas and sentences that were impossible to copy down or understand their use. Gave us formula sheets that were very helpful to do tests and worksheets. Most learning done on own with worksheets and book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yolande Tra	3.5	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	758522	11/16/05	Very clear and straightforward lecturer. Has you print out handouts, which you do in-class. Quizes and exams cover everything she teaches, with no nasty surprises. (you're allowed a crib sheet of varying size) Overall I highly suggest taking her for stats.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management		5	5	5	5	1535970	2/19/13	He's amazing teacher. He's sweet and very good with deaf people. He will make sure that deaf people understand it clearly. He also believes in giving deaf people an hour extra for exam. He's awesome.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	1	Management	438	4	3	3	3	1535970	3/3/12	If you come to class it's an easy grade. Open book/notes midterm and final. Essays can be a bit complicated and hard to understand what he's looking for, but hes willing to clarify if you go for help. Overall not a bad teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management	113	2	5	4	5	1535970	5/28/11	He has traveled many places and was in UAE during class. Pushed creativity and that made it hard on some assignments because we were not sure what was needed. Learned a lot. Great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	1	Management	438	2	3	3	4	1535970	5/17/11	Alright teacher, not real clear on expectations, and brings in graduate level professors to grade the undergrad presentations. Brings in local business leaders.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management	507	3	5	5	4	1535970	11/11/12	Professor Traub is a great professor he is interested in his students learning and is helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management		5	3	4	2	1535970	11/10/11	WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! I could teach the class to myself. It was pointless to go AT ALL! Tests are open note open book and pretty much a joke. Take this professor if you want an easy A and to be annoyed for 10 weeks
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management	438	1	4	4	4	1535970	5/27/11	Kept students engaged and really liked the guest speakers. One speaker was a president of a company. Presentations were tough, since we had to work in teams. Tests were open book, but hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Traub	4.1	2	Management	113	2	5	5	5	1535970	2/25/11	Great Professor. Brings a lot of industry knowledge into the classroom!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Tribunella	3.8	1	Accounting		3	2	3	1	741273	2/7/06	Although he has great stories to tell, he is not leniant at all with grades. If you are only less than a point below a better grade he will not budge. His tests are hard, but the presentations are easy and is an easy grader on those. Tests are rediculous!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Tribunella	3.8	2	Accounting		3	5	5	5	741273	10/30/05	This guy is a great teacher. He makes 8am classes worth going to. Tells really funny and interesting stories related to the class. He's really nice and approachable too. The material tested is only the stuff covered in class. All the notes are handed out to you, which makes it easy to study. Great teacher- take him if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science	101	4	5	3	1	14243	1/17/12	The best prof I've had so far. He has this talent that allows him to make class educational and entertaining at the same time. Always providing with quiz and exam practice material. Doesn't require to have a book. Really loves his students and always being like joking.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	0	Computer Science		2	3	1	NULL	14243	8/5/04	Troell is like an experience. He gives you the test first, and the lesson afterwards.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	14243	2/1/03	Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science		5	4	4	NULL	14243	9/15/01	I wish they could all be like him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	NULL	14243	2/17/03	The best prof I have had. He had a southern charm to match his Texas accent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science	342	4	5	5	NULL	14243	12/20/02	KNOWS his stuff, and explains it well. Very understanding. Charming & easy-going
Rochester Institute of Technology	Luther Troell	4.4	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	NULL	14243	9/9/01	Great guy to learn from, loves students, will bend over backwards to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1360661	2/19/13	Olga is the sweetest lady around, and a great teacher too!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	231	5	5	4	3	1360661	11/27/12	Tsukernik is amazing and if you have the opportunity to take this professor I highly recommend it. She is from Soviet Union so has a heavy accent however her explanations on topics are spot on, and is willing to help a student whenever she can. She is very understanding and if you do the homework (for practice) you should be fine with exams. (:
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	1360661	5/21/12	She is the best math teacher I've ever had. Very clear and thorough in explaining topics. Answers all your questions and gives you opportunities to better your grade. Her quizzes and tests can be a bit tricky but if you do your homework, you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	261	2	5	4	4	1360661	4/27/11	She is a very good teacher. She went above and beyond the class material without leaving anyone behind and made the next math quarter a breeze.she is a fair grader but not an easy one and she's very willing to help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	2	1360661	10/29/10	She is so clear & concise. If you didn't understand calculus before you will after her. The work is not too difficult just pay attention & take notes in class ask questions if needed & you will get an A garanteed! She has an accent but compared to other profs hers is very light & easy to understand. You will love her and math! Very awesome teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	1360661	4/27/10	Prof. Tsukernik is straightforward. Her Russian accent is not a problem and tests are a huge grading investment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	1360661	2/8/10	Best teacher ever. You learn to love her accent and she teaches quickly, but clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	261	3	5	4	4	1360661	1/29/10	Clear, helpful,friendly and nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	271	3	4	4	3	1360661	11/29/12	Professor Tsukernik really made calc fun. She is a great teacher who is always willing to help students out and answer questions. Her grading policy is fair and she gives partial credit as best she can. I recommend her for sure.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	231	3	5	4	4	1360661	10/29/12	Awesome teacher! She might come off as rude the first time you see her bc she doesn't say hello but i think tht just her Russian ways. Her accent isn't bad. She is always willing to help and constantly asks to make sure everyone understands. She makes some mistakes on the board so if you notice something wrong point it out and she will say nice job
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	1360661	1/27/12	great teacher.. had her twice.. didnt know calc before i learned from her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics	226	4	5	5	5	1360661	2/2/11	She is a great teacher! She goes over the information before tests and gives examples very similar to ones on test. She is very clear and I love her teaching style!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	3	1360661	5/11/10	Very helpful and understanding, best math teacher I've had so far!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	1360661	3/11/10	3 words: "DO ... THE ... HOMEWORK"! If you do this, you'll do VERY well. Tutoring is a GREAT help too. Professor Tsukernik is VERY well organized, very friendly/helpful, and very fair on grading, extending multiple extra-credit opportunities. She's a GREAT professor and RIT needs more like her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	1360661	1/30/10	I had her twice. Very good professor. Very organized. Accent is not a problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Olga Tsukernik	4.6	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	4	1360661	1/27/10	Heavy russian accent but gets clearer after time. Not a bad teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hasan Tuncer	3.0	1	Information Technology		3	4	2	2	1405755	10/27/10	cool guy, kinda hard to keep up with in class, but does his tests online. also likes to assign a lot of homework and has very high expectations, pretty nice
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Turner	2.8	1	Environmental Studies	101	3	3	3	3	1533291	4/14/11	A professor who clearly cares about what he is teaching, very informed lectures and anecdotes during class. He tried to make it fun when possible with music, food, outdoors etc. However, can drag on a bit, discussions a bit contrived. plenty of reading required, take home exams
Rochester Institute of Technology	Roger Turner	2.8	1	Environmental Studies	211	3	2	3	3	1533291	2/26/11	The class itself was very interesting. The topics we covered really made you think about the world around you. His intentions were good but all we did was read and discuss in class. It was difficult to predict how detailed the quizzes and tests would be. Attendance and reading is needed to be successful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	0	Environmental Science		1	1	1	5	907542	4/11/11	All test questions are so vague and the "right" answer is not what was stated in the readings. SO much work, for little learning, condescending, has incorrect terminology, and I am saying this as an env. student- lacks the ability to put env. thoughts into real world ideas.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	2	Environmental Science		4	5	3	5	907542	6/25/08	She's great. Very understanding and helpful. However surprise quizzes a bit hard. Asks questions you wouldn't expect (and sometimes people misunderstand exactly what she's asking) but plenty opportunity to get an A if you're not lazy. Lab reports are real easy. Attendance required. You really won't have a problem with this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	2	Environmental Science		3	5	4	4	907542	12/13/06	This class WILL make you work your butt off! Though she will give you LOTS of assignments to do (readings, quizzes, lab reports, essays, projects), but I've learned a great deal of information related to my major. Despite the heavy load, she is really helpful for students. Lectures are boring, but the labs and field trips are pretty cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	2	Environmental Science		2	5	4	5	907542	10/17/10	she's a professor. and a woman.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	2	Environmental Science		3	4	4	5	907542	5/20/08	She's a good professor but she asks very vague questions. The class is usually staring at her blankly like 'huh?' and students try to answer her question but they get it wrong then when she says the answer it is obvious to everyone that she could have expressed herself better. I would still recommend her though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anna Christy Tyler	3.8	2	Environmental Science		2	5	5	5	907542	10/31/06	A great teacher, just be carefull of the amount of work she requires, very posible to get an A with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science	212	4	5	4	1	70331	10/26/10	Going into his Princ. of Comp. Sci. class, I had no prior knowledge of coding whatsoever. But there are weekly labs and lectures that make coding not so difficult to understand. Explains things clearly and is extremely helpful. If I liked computing at all, I'd take one of his classes again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	1	Computer Science		2	2	4	3	70331	4/26/06	This guy is in love with java! This may be good if your taking CS1-3, however it sucks bigtime in PLC! He spend the first 5 weeks talking about our project which was in java, and then crammed all the other stuff @ the end. I didnt get a grade back untill week 7! This is not cool.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	70331	2/5/06	Some how he was able to cover almost the entire JAVA language in a quarter and still remain fair and clear. His tests and assingments whill not simple are compleatly fair. He is also more then willing to help you if you need it. If you get the chance take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	5	5	70331	10/18/05	Awesome teacher, a great guy too, he's smart and funny and really nice. Glad to have him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	70331	2/2/05	Very interesting professor. I actually didn't fall asleep in his 8-9 am class. Presents the topic very clearly. The only thing is that he goes a little slow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	70331	10/12/04	Teaches you what you need to know, AND manages to be highly entertaining.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science	232	3	5	5	NULL	70331	2/17/03	One of the best Professors I have ever had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	0	Computer Science		2	1	2	3	70331	7/27/06	Everyone says this guy is great which is why I took him, but I really didn't think he lived up to his reputation. Yes, he's funny and enjoyable in class, but that doesn't necessarily help you learn, especially not well enough for his test questions. If you haven't had any programming experience before RIT, take someone who will actually help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	70331	2/8/06	Amazing! GREAT TEACHER. Funny, interesting, etc. Pretty easy as long as you do well on the tests which are all based on his PowerPoint slides.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	70331	12/6/05	Paul T. Tymann is the mortal incarnation of Thor, God of Thunder. Also possibly the God of Male Pattern Baldness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	70331	10/14/05	Great guy, intersting, helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science		3	4	4	4	70331	1/30/05	Great guy. Very entertaining. Does tend to lag in completing topics. This has caused a few problems. But otherwise not bad at all. Doesnt make class boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Tymann	4.3	2	Computer Science	440	2	4	4	NULL	70331	5/27/04	One of the best CS profs at RIT. He's fair in grading, clear in presenting coursework, and entertaining.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	1	Physics		3	3	2	2	1580829	11/17/12	Classes are fun, but sometimes are boring. His final exam was a multiple choice exam, which was not easy. Exams are not well organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics		5	5	5	5	1580829	11/22/11	Great Prof & Great Guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics	211	3	5	3	2	1580829	11/14/11	HAS BONUS PROJECTS! He is always willing to answer questions. He's always in his office during posted office hours and is very helpful if you seek help. He can be a little fast paced in his lectures, but the result is usually that the class stays on track during the quarter and all the material is covered. His tests can be hard but are always fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics	211	2	5	4	3	1580829	11/2/11	Extremely helpful outside of class. Tests were hard but fair. If you did the homework and paid attention you should do well on his tests. Laid back and easy going.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics		3	5	3	2	1580829	9/4/11	Dr. Urmansky is very nice and laid back as a professor. He is willing to go the extra mile to help students understand material especially in office hours. His tests are a fair assessment of class and, homework. He will admit to mistakes and correct them as needed. Summer 2011 was his second time teaching College Physics 1,he did a good job!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics		3	4	5	3	1580829	2/27/12	Definitely one of the better professors in the physics department. He's a good lecturer, and is willing to go over problems if you have questions. Provides plenty of time to work on problems in class as well. I'd recommend him if you've got the choice to take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	1580829	11/22/11	Very good teacher. Explains everything well and willing to explain again if you don't understand. Knows what he is teaching and likes teaching it
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics		3	5	5	5	1580829	11/11/11	Dr. Urminsky is a great teacher! really cares that students learned and slides were always helpful. Take his class. hes a great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	2	Physics	210	3	5	3	3	1580829	10/11/11	Dr. Urminsky is the best professor compared to other professor's in the department (See everyone else's ratings). He takes a lot of time to explain, visits all of the students during workshop to make sure they are understanding, study guides, etc... Once in a while he is a bit disorganized (typo's in slides), but no one's perfect. Would recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	David Urminsky	4.1	0	Physics		3	2	2	1	1580829	5/16/11	Has trouble explaining simple concepts. Gets caught up in his own notes, not organized. He needs a teaching degree!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics	103	4	5	5	2	1480870	12/3/12	great teacher all the way around, very clear
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics	101	4	4	4	4	1480870	2/1/12	Great professor. uses a lot of graphs and equations to describe economic concepts. Tests and homeworks are your entire grade, but they arent too hard
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		2	4	5	3	1480870	11/20/11	He doesn't use textbook.DON'T BUY TEXTBOOK ALTHOUGH HE WILL TELL YOU TO BUY IT.I don't buy textbook but I stil get A.I bought the 8th edition with only $6 and got refund as it didn't contain the online access as the description said.his final exam is comprehensive while other professor's are not(like only chapter7 to 11).His teaching is good though
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		5	5	4	4	1480870	10/27/11	Very fair and understanding. Great teacher and knows the material well. He is consistent in regards to notes, quizzes, and tests and gives helpful practice problems out and takes time to solve them in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		4	4	5	3	1480870	10/13/11	His lectures are very clear and easy to follow. His gestures and sarcastic sense of humor are quite entertaining. Just pay attention in class and you'll get through with ease.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		4	4	3	3	1480870	4/23/11	Very effective teacher, he was not particularly interesting as a person. Some homework may be difficult and does not give partial credit in tests but they are not very hard if you know the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		4	4	3	4	1480870	2/2/11	great guy, a little hard to understand, but knows the materiel well. Pay attention in class and don't fall asleep and you'll do fine. Nothing crazy. Good class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		5	5	5	2	1480870	2/16/12	easy class easy A for me
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		4	5	5	4	1480870	1/25/12	Excellent professor. Presents material in a clear and concise format which is easily understood with regular class attendance. Homework assignments and sample exams line up perfectly with examinations. Would recommend him to anyone. Can definitely count on Dr. Valencia to get the material across in a respectable fashion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	0	Economics		2	2	2	1	1480870	11/17/11	Horrible class, however it is required. He is somewhat helpful if you like being laughed at. He treats the course as if it is a graduate course not an intro one. Hard material, and he in my opinion doesn't teach it any easier. either you get the material or you dont and if you dont, then don't take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		5	5	5	5	1480870	10/27/11	he doesn't use textbook at all.He will increase the test score for 2 midterm exams by average the 2 scores and replace the lower with the average.Join his class as he is good at teaching among other micro professors
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics	211	4	5	4	4	1480870	10/2/11	He reminds me a lot of Ken Jeong from the Hangover from his accent and body gestures. His class is pretty easy as long as you pay attention, he has sarcastic humor but easy overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Vicar Valencia	4.3	2	Economics		4	4	5	4	1480870	4/12/11	He will come off as a very anal and strict the first day telling people who are not there to learn to drop now but he is actually a nice guy with a bit of an accent. He puts crystal clear lecture notes online and it is easy to get an A if you listen in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	0	Engineering	362	1	1	3	4	389260	6/18/10	I have had Vallino before and enjoyed his teaching style but this quarter/class he was completely different. This class is a "teach-yourself" thing so Vallino was totally passive on each topic. It's like shooting in the dark for a good grade since you have no idea what he is looking for. I guess it preps you for co-op or something...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	2	Engineering	362	2	5	5	5	389260	5/16/09	Excellent professor. An extremely helpful professor. Very clear in explaining concepts in the class. If you have trouble, he will point you in the right direction. Very useful feedback. Reasonable grader.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	2	Engineering	362	3	3	4	4	389260	8/12/05	He's a good professor who teaches his material well, opening up class or related topics for discussion among students frequently. He is generally very helpful during office hours as well, although you'd do yourself a favor by knowing what you're talking about when you get there or he won't take you seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	2	Engineering	361	3	3	4	5	389260	12/1/09	Great lectures but not much help outside of class. Rarely responds to email and gives late feedback. Class consists of one large group project, three exams, weekly reports and various deadlines. I found the class difficult and had to learn most topics from the book or classmates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	2	Engineering	362	3	4	4	4	389260	7/26/06	Probably the best professor in the SE department. He makes class interesting, gives reasonable amounts of work, and grades reasonably too. You definitely have to do the work in his classes, but you learn a lot. Also, he's generally available and helpful in his office.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vallino	3.8	2	Engineering	362	2	5	4	NULL	389260	4/19/04	He is very helpful when you go to see him and his tests are straight forward. He tries to help all he can. The classes he teaches are hard not the professor and no he's not as scary as you've heard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Van Ginkel	4.9	2	Art History		5	5	5	5	1255624	3/10/10	She is GREEEAT!!!! She is the most awesome teacher I have had through out RIT! She is very friendly, nice and she is really funny! She is very helpful towards her students she thinks about others than herself. Great teacher! I would recommend her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Van Ginkel	4.9	2	Art History		3	5	5	5	1255624	11/21/09	Awesome teacher! TAKE HER!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Van Ginkel	4.9	2	Art History		2	5	5	5	1255624	2/3/10	Love her! The best art teacher in the art department!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Van Ginkel	4.9	2	Art History		4	5	4	3	1255624	4/21/09	She's a great person to host Freshman Seminar! She's interesting, and had her husband, Quinsland or as per many, Dr. Q, to be part of her in-class activities to teach about the reproductive system.... Though don't get me wrong, when she teaches, it's like high school all over.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Panchapakesan Vankataraman	1.1	0	Engineering	560	2	1	2	2	1126923	11/23/11	Lectures are all over the place so knowing what is important is a guessing game. Grading is not fair at all, you get points off for not having the correct answer AND for the small mistake that led to it. Not sure you can avoid him, just be prepared to endure it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Panchapakesan Vankataraman	1.1	0	Engineering	518	1	1	1	4	1126923	5/6/11	He is terrible avoid at all costs

Rochester Institute of Technology	Panchapakesan Vankataraman	1.1	0	Engineering	560	1	1	1	5	1126923	10/11/11	Absolutely Terrible. Probably the least helpful and most difficult professor I have ever had. He refuses to talk to you about problems, doesn't appreciate questions in class, and will not help outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Panchapakesan Vankataraman	1.1	0	Engineering	336	1	1	1	1	1126923	4/23/09	ugh...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Varela	2.9	2	Engineering		5	4	3	3	634859	3/8/12	Easy class if you do many practice problems. Any tests and quizzes were problems straight out of the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Varela	2.9	1	Engineering		3	3	2	3	634859	11/20/11	Exams are only 2-3 questions and can be ambiguous. Grades are only like 8 quizzes, attendance, 3 exams. Can be a picky grader. Essentially reads textbook. Not the clearest of lectures and can't really draw. But he will meet with you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Varela	2.9	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	634859	2/9/06	Sometimes confusing, but makes time to study in the ELC. Fair grader, tests have lots of easy points to get.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Varela	2.9	1	Engineering		4	3	3	3	634859	11/23/11	He's a nice guy, hard to understand at times, and sometimes isn't clear in lectures but his quizzes are from the homework and tests are only a few questions. Overall not too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin Varela	2.9	0	Engineering	344	3	1	2	3	634859	3/3/09	Terrible teacher. Doesn't explain the material well; horrible at getting papers back to you; unfair grader. Don't take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Tubbs	4.7	2	Science		2	5	4	4	67478	2/4/08	Quite possibly my favorite teacher of all time. She is very friendly, and always has a smile on her face. Makes material as easy as she can. Does lots of examples, and is always available for extra help and office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Tubbs	4.7	2	Science		2	5	5	4	67478	7/30/07	I loved Tubbs, she was always friendly and helpful. Always makes time for students and birthday donuts were fun too. Great lab teacher, consisent when grading and tells you how to improve your work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Tubbs	4.7	2	Science		3	5	5	5	67478	8/31/05	Always available for outside of class & during class for any questions and extra help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Laura Tubbs	4.7	2	Science		2	5	5	2	67478	1/7/08	I had her for Gen. chem 1&2 also for Quant. She Teaches like no other, very easy to understand, lots of notes with tones of examples. homework is not graded will help with tests. she even tells you what examples that she will test on!!!!!! Great teacher!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science	436	3	2	2	4	67464	8/10/11	My first impression was this teacher was nice, until she was actually teaching material. She treats you like your dumb if you ask a question even if everyone else has the same question. She makes you feel like you don't listen to her but reality is she doesn't explain or teach well. She likes suck ups too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		2	4	3	3	67464	4/22/07	I took organic chemistry with Dr Turner. Well, if you're hoping that she'll explain everything to you and you dont have to do any extra work yourself, better not take with her. Somehow I like her class cause she helped so much with her review sheets for every exam. Just study the sheets and you'll be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	1	Science		1	2	3	2	67464	1/18/07	She is organized and everything is there but the exam is much harder that what I expected and I've never really managed to get used to her exams so I ended up with bad grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	1	Science		1	3	2	4	67464	5/24/06	Horrible professor that gets enjoyment out of toturing her students. Study your ass off and you'll still do poorly. better off taking the trailer course!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		2	5	5	3	67464	3/19/06	Great teacher who knows her stuff, the classes are challenging but if you study like your suppose to then there is no prolem learning the material. She was always helpful to people who had trouble and even arranged for the college of science to pay private tutors for students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science		3	1	3	5	67464	2/2/06	According to her unless you have a 4.0 don't even waste her time trying to get into med school. She doesn't think anybody is good enough, and everyone is just a waste of her time. She is also totally rude, I had a meeting with her and after the meeting I would say hi to her in the hall and she would just ignore me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	1	Science	123	2	2	4	3	67464	9/21/05	Expects students to memorize rather than teaching the mechanisms and mechanics behind reactions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	1	Science		2	3	2	3	67464	1/27/05	She loves PAs. She tries her best to give everyone else a hard time though. A very tough, but manageable, courseload.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science		1	1	1	NULL	67464	5/27/04	She HATES biotech majors, don't bother trying to go to her for help. The book and other people in the class are more helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		3	5	4	NULL	67464	7/3/03	Tough, smart, do the work and she will do her best to help you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		5	5	4	5	67464	2/12/11	Prep-Organic Chem Lab II: She is helpful and an easy grader on the lab reports. She is also nice if you are polite and genuine with her. Be an idiot and she will treat you like an idiot. If you listen to her rules/instructions, then you will find she is a great person/professor, and you will enjoy the lab (as much as is possible anyways :P).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science	232	1	1	2	3	67464	1/26/07	Awful professor. Reads the slides that come with the book for lecture. When asking relevent questions she has answered "look it up" on the review day for an exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	1	Science	231	1	3	3	1	67464	10/17/06	She's an all right teacher and I think most of the bad things said about her are exaggerated. Classes are organized and she gives students opportunities for plenty of practice and tutoring if they need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science		1	1	1	3	67464	5/22/06	donot take her class! u ll be sorry. horrible teacher and person! plus she smells!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		2	5	5	3	67464	3/4/06	Hard class, but Dr. Turner teaches it extremely well making the material relatively eas to understand, but if you are not fully understanding Dr. T can hook you up with some tutors or can help you herself, as long as you schedule in advance. And either type of help is very helpful, Study hard and get the concept and you'll be part of the A+ club.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science		2	2	1	3	67464	11/16/05	Not the best science teacher at all, she might just not know the material she is teaching. she complains about her short term memory, she should probably just retire.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		1	4	5	1	67464	9/10/05	I learned so much from Dr. Turner. She is very tough but work hard and she will reward you. If you need help be prepared with questions ahead of time, she doesn't like to waste time. I highly recommend if you have to take org. chem. take it with her. She teachs big classes but is extremely well organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	0	Science	231	3	1	2	4	67464	10/22/04	take it if you are a pa. if not good luck!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kay Turner	3.0	2	Science		2	5	3	NULL	67464	2/26/04	One of the tougher courses I had to take, but she offers all the help you can get. Sometimes the exams are a lot more difficult than you'd expect it to be.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing	201	3	5	5	3	682637	8/12/10	Excellent business sense and real world examples. Interesting presentation that did not involve widgets....
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing	101	2	5	5	5	682637	5/29/08	His Marketing Concept (Graduate level) was the very first marketing class I had, he was tough, 1/3 of the students dropped the class, but in end you will learn a lot --- real life experience + all that you need to know about marketing concepts. Great personality! He is the best professor @ Saunders.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	0	Marketing		1	1	2	1	682637	10/13/05	He made me hate marketing.He is a very tough professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing		3	5	5	5	682637	9/7/05	Although he uses the same stories year after year, which can get a little hokey, he totally understands his field and gives a ton of real life examples. Lots of in class practice and great discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing	559	1	5	5	2	682637	7/1/08	This is THE BEST professor EVER!!!!! He teaches you not only about professional selling or marketing, but more importantly about life!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing		1	4	4	2	682637	12/5/06	Marketing Management problems was the hardest class I ever took at RIT and professor Tyler was the best professor I ever had at RIT. He cares about every student and really wants you to learn. It was nice to have a professor who actually gave it to you like it is and did not sugar coat things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing		1	5	5	3	682637	11/17/05	Tough Quizzes/Tests/Papers. But hes a great guy. Classes are fun and you will learn a lot.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Philip Tyler	3.9	2	Marketing		2	5	4	4	682637	10/7/05	He rocks even though he's pretty tough. I learned soooooo much from him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Ulin	3.7	0	Anthropology	101	3	2	2	1	1625694	7/11/12	The class was overall boring. Teacher talked for whole two hours straight every time I went to class. Does not act very passionate in class and has a very monotonous tone of voice. Does not have much clarity for anything. Is an average teacher, would recommend a better teacher if you could take instead.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Ulin	3.7	1	Anthropology		3	2	3	1	1625694	10/25/11	Boring, doesn't teach us anything in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Ulin	3.7	2	Anthropology	210	4	5	5	3	1625694	10/11/11	He is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about Anthro. He studied wine cooperatives if France for many years. He has practical knowledge. He likes discussion and doesn't require the details in the tests. There are two books that you read and they are really interesting. Very interesting. I could listen to him talk all day.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Ulin	3.7	2	Anthropology	510	4	5	5	2	1625694	1/18/12	Dr. Ulin didn't have a very tough class. Nevertheless, if you do have trouble, he will be very helpful to any who shows any interest in the subject. The honest truth is that 70% is just showing up, and any extra effort is going to show up as a better grade. If you need a liberal arts credit, definitely take one from this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Ulin	3.7	2	Anthropology		5	4	4	3	1625694	10/16/11	He is a really good guy. His lectures are kind of boring but the discussions and debates he starts in the class are really exciting. I would reccommend bringing your laptop for notes and for something to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vaeth	4.8	2	Health Science		5	5	4	5	843025	2/3/11	Take this class! It is worth it and it feels good. Lectors are not boring, and class goes by very fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vaeth	4.8	2	Health Science		5	5	5	5	843025	5/18/07	Very nice guy. Knows what he's talking about and is passionate about it. Realloy concerned with the well being of others. Long lectures for a massage class, but they can be intresting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vaeth	4.8	2	Health Science		5	5	5	1	843025	2/5/08	Nice guy-- fun class. MAKE SURE you sign up with a partner because lots of dudes show up.. and unless you wanna get paired up randomly- bring your own massage buddy! Pretty long talks and stories for a massage class, but really helpful and informative with massage techniques. Relaxing class for an easy grade-- just SHOW UP he's big on attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jim Vaeth	4.8	2	Health Science		5	5	4	4	843025	5/5/06	A nice guy but can be boring. Aside from his long speeches in each class, the actual massage techniques are worth it, proving to be effective and helpful. He is very strict about attendance, only letting two absences. Beware of skipping, if he notices he'll get angry and possibly fail you.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jan Van Aardt	2.7	2	Imaging Science		4	5	5	4	1448963	3/26/13	Great professor! Takes great care to explain concepts if a student doesn't understand. I recommend his classes to other students who are interested in remote sensing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jan Van Aardt	2.7	0	Imaging Science	420	2	1	1	2	1448963	5/23/10	Great guy. Can't teach to save his life, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jan Van Aardt	2.7	0	Imaging Science		1	2	2	1	1448963	5/16/11	If you are really interested in remote sensing and imaging science, he is teacher to spark your interest, otherwise he is not good at teaching those that have no prior knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Derek Vanderlinde	1.9	0	Business		1	1	1	1	1706992	3/20/13	Has a completely arbitrary system of grading. I would recommend all to stay away. He tries to inspire but fails so desperately that it is unbearable to be around him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Derek Vanderlinde	1.9	1	Business	320	1	3	2	2	1706992	7/26/12	Would not recommend to anyone, not specific on what tests will be on, (each inclusive of about 100+pgs from textbook) and all essay style. Text used is highly debated for credibility and usefulness. Sparked good debates in class but when it came down to grading, was outrageous with difficulty even with following the reading diligently. Try to avoid
Rochester Institute of Technology	Derek Vanderlinde	1.9	0	Business		2	2	2	4	1706992	8/16/12	Derek is a nice man.Thats about the best thing I can say about him. He wants to teach but has no idea how too.His class discussions can be fun but are often elementaryEx: he will demand answers to questions like "What does it mean that people learn differently?". This class is not fun, you dont learn much and its clear he doesnt put effort into mat
Rochester Institute of Technology	Derek Vanderlinde	1.9	0	Business	201	2	2	2	1	1706992	5/10/12	guy is a joke. dont bother taking him in any course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		5	5	5	3	906937	1/31/13	Good teacher. Has clear expectations. Very helpful and walks you though the writing process. Not too much reading. Write all of the papers and you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		5	5	5	4	906937	11/27/12	She was a great teacher and made the mandatory Writing Seminar a great class. We watched several relevant but funny videos and cartoons. She was a fairly easy grader and assigns mainly short essays. Not much reading was required.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	102	4	5	5	3	906937	1/24/11	Very fun person- Experienced and smart. She grades fairly and enjoys students' company. good teacher to have for Writing seminar
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		4	4	5	5	906937	10/28/09	Where do I start??? She is one of the better teachers to have taught me. Her assignments are clear and she is very helpful. You cannot go wrong with Ms V. Very Fun, Very Nice, Loves to crack jokes with us.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	227	5	5	5	2	906937	8/26/09	Pretty easy if you speak English. Class consisted of three papers, weekly homework, participation, quiz, final and extra credit. Sometimes VanMeenen didn't feel like teaching so she would dismiss class after a few minutes or we watched movies and other fun stuff. Very easy and enjoyable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		2	5	5	3	906937	2/5/09	Her dedication to the subject matter rubs off. You can tell she enjoys teaching. Her discussions (usually about the media and politics) are very interesting and she has cool tatoos. You have to work for an "A" but it is still attainable if you do the work. Overall, an excellent prof! I would take another class with her in a hearbeat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		3	5	5	5	906937	4/22/08	well, she seems like a great teacher, i like all those videos, and it is weird but she reminds me of a girl i knew...don't know...? very youthful exuberance! YAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		3	4	3	2	906937	4/3/07	This is true, she does not teach; and for the most part does not teach or lecture about writing or grammar. She is nice but the class is very work intensive, you will be doing a lot of reading and writing in this class. The books are based on her views and the writing is subjective, so if you disagree with her like I did; you may not fare so well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	0	Writing		1	1	2	1	906937	2/12/07	Amount of work varies. She indicates she increases work each semester. She behaves as if students have no other classes. Her grading is completely based on opinion. I have been complemented on my writing and grammar by many professors at R.I.T but my papers do not reflect her point of view so she gives low grades without finding errors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		4	4	4	2	906937	10/29/06	Class is easy, but it seems more of an anti-war rally than a writing seminar. Pretty much all of the books are chosen based on her political views, so if you don't agree with her you may not like the class. She doesn't really teach, either. We mostly discuss unrelated things and that takes up a good bit of the class time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	100	4	5	5	4	906937	1/27/13	Great teacher, fair grader and enjoys teaching and you will enjoy learning,makes Writing Sem bearable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		4	4	4	3	906937	5/17/12	Fun teacher, pretty easy course. An A is not that hard at all, easier than getting an A with any other teacher. 10% of the grade is participation, 5% extra credit(free for a little work) 10% for a take home quiz. So thats 25% of free grades for the course. The rest is 2 essays 20% each, homework 20%, and the research paper 25%. No final exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		4	5	5	5	906937	9/24/10	Best prof I've had in my yrs at RIT. Expectations were clear and class was a blast! Usually had an assignment due every class but were often short (write less than a page, read ect). She was fun and discussion based. Pop quizzes were take home. Best class ever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	227	4	5	5	2	906937	10/27/09	I loved this class, it was more discussion oriented which is my style completely
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	319	3	5	5	5	906937	2/6/09	Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing	101	3	4	5	5	906937	7/16/08	Van Meenen is the quirky but cool girl you knew in high school. She's really smart, and a fun teacher. She's one of the kids, but will crack the whip if no one's putting in effort. Be sure to read (the books are fine, she even nixed one in my class that was too boring) and do your journals/papers. Cool prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		3	4	5	5	906937	10/22/07	Her grading has nothing to do with political views, so I don't know why people are saying that. There is a lot of reading, but I actually really enjoyed everything we had to read. She's an awesome teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		5	5	5	5	906937	2/20/07	Amazing professor. Usually get a 9/10 on most assignments no matter the number of errors. A good amount of work, but her deadlines arent set. Ive turned in assignment 3 weeks late with no point reduction. Very flexible and if the class doesnt feel they can do an assignment, she`ll increase the deadline. Good sense of humor as well. Fun class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Vanmeenen	4.5	2	Writing		3	4	4	3	906937	11/1/06	This class is easy, but there is a lot of work. This involves reading, and about 3 pages of writing per week. The professor discusses political views and most of the course reflects this. She does not do much in class, besides a grammar lesson. Time spent mostly discussing political topics or watching videos. It is more of a media study class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering		2	2	3	4	881864	3/16/13	She flies through lectures. I have never had a professor fit so much information into a single lecture. She goes through many examples and tries to make the lass interactive. Her grading on tests is brutal. You either get most of the points or none of the points. Her accept is challenging to get through at first.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering		2	2	4	4	881864	11/19/12	Nice teaching style - at least I like it - very easy for undergrad courses but for grad her exams are to watch out for. However she is not at all helpful outside the class try attending each nd evry class to be on her good books and Dont be late
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering	350	1	3	3	3	881864	11/10/11	The most difficult EE instructor at RIT, but highly recommended in E&M fields knowledge.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	2	Electrical Engineering	473	4	5	5	4	881864	2/4/10	Professor JAYANTI Venkatramen is one of the best professors in the Electrical Engineering Department. I have never had a teacher pack so much material into an hour of class and in such clarity. All the bad reviews on here for her are people who think this is her husband. He teaches statics in the Mech E department.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	2	Electrical Engineering		1	4	4	3	881864	8/7/08	Very good teacher. Extremely knowledgable when it comes to class content. Presents in a very clear manner. TExt for EM2 is written by her and each lecture goes page by page through book. Highly recomend prof elec's with her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	0	Electrical Engineering	336	2	1	2	4	881864	10/21/07	rude when asked for help. not clear in lecture
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	1	Electrical Engineering		2	2	4	4	881864	11/19/12	I would also like to add that she is very knowledgeable as far as EM Fields are concerned - however may be she was not nice to me - but try attending class - that should help u a lot and do take running notes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	0	Electrical Engineering	473	1	2	2	3	881864	10/6/12	Horrible teacher. First she talks nonstop the whole class so its hard to keep up and learn at the same time. She stands directly in front of the white board when shes writing on it which does not help with learning. Class asked her to slow down and it lasted for about 5 minuets. Very hard to learn anything in class. Exams are very hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	0	Electrical Engineering		2	1	2	3	881864	4/19/11	Very unclear and unhelpful. Her exams and book she expects you to buy are littered with typos, due to her laziness and blatant lack of concern for students. Rude, doesn't welcome questions, and bad at explaining things. Heavy accent doesn't help. And yes, I'm talking about her, not her husband.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	2	Electrical Engineering		4	3	4	2	881864	8/13/08	Great Prof! If you can do the homework questions, you WILL do well on the exam. JUST DO THE HOMEWORK QUESTIONS AND YOULL BE FINE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jayanti Venkataraman	2.8	0	Electrical Engineering		3	1	2	5	881864	11/15/07	useless to go talk to. if you have questions your better of asking the wall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ashley  Versaggi	2.0	0	Chemistry		3	2	2	2	1798903	2/22/13	She is lab instructor never grades lab reports on time only first 3. During finals week labs will not be graded and you wont know your grade on mycourses. Never answer email regarding lab questions only few hours before lab. Lab protocols are somewhat easy to follow. However she allows make up lab if you miss one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Vick	3.2	2	Information Technology		3	4	4	4	1039782	4/12/11	Overall great teacher, very very intelligent man. He is harsh on the students ideas, but that is just because he wants you to think things through. Would take a class with him again in a heart beat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Vick	3.2	1	Information Technology		2	2	3	4	1039782	10/18/07	Took for interactive digital media and wish I hadn't. I had a lot of trouble understanding what he was talking about since he isn't organized in his lectures and grazes over very important parts. A lot of this course is going to be self taught if you take it. The TA was more helpful and better at explaining in my opinion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	2	860740	4/4/13	He is first professor I have had that made me want to review him. He's a great guy who keeps you interested. I wish he taught all of my math classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	2	Graphic Arts		5	4	4	2	860740	1/26/11	Hahaha if you know math hes a funny guy, but if you need to seriously learn then he might not be the most helpful guy. Entertaining and a good guy overall.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	0	Graphic Arts		3	2	2	3	860740	10/19/07	had him for data analysis...crappy teacher, nobody learned anything, but its easy to pass because test/quizzes are in pencil and you grade them yourself ;)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	2	Graphic Arts	316	4	4	4	4	860740	6/23/06	Awesome prof., explains stuff well. Decent about makeups. Sometimes goes off on tangents.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	3	1	860740	11/27/11	Strange guy, very funny and good hearted. Very smart. Doesn't make data harder than it has to be, like other professors do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	0	Graphic Arts		4	1	1	1	860740	10/28/07	Had for Data Analysis, horrible teacher, just goes on rants, doesn't even explain what he writes on the board
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Viggiano	3.4	2	Graphic Arts	316	3	4	5	4	860740	10/17/06	GREAT PROF
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		4	4	4	3	456446	11/15/07	Ignore the previous rating, she replied to my email.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	456446	10/22/07	Extremely nice person. One on one meetings are beneficial, she really wants to help out her students as much as she can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	456446	2/23/07	Awesome. Just do the assignments and you are sure to get an A in the class. Super nice lady who knows what she is doing and is actually concerned about how you are doing in school and such. Real nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		4	5	5	1	456446	11/19/06	FYE sucks in general, but since you have to take it, you might as well take it with someone like karen Violanti. She is super nice, and real easy to talk to. She also responds to emails very quickly and is prietty organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	5	5	5	5	456446	10/28/06	Awesom teacher to have, not bad to look at either, happy to have her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	456446	12/2/05	Like everyone says very nice. Easy class bla blah blah. But her assistant guy does nothing I have no idea why he's there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	1	456446	10/24/05	she's really nice and just wants to be your friend. for an FYE teacher, she is probably one of the best. the one on one meeting is a bit tedius, but oh, well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	2	456446	2/26/05	Mandatory for every 1st year; hopefully you'll get lucky & get Karen! She's more liek a friend than a prof. & the one-on-one meeting is like having a casual conversation with a good friend. She cares about you/your success & is there to help in any way; just go to class/do your hw & you'll do fine!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	0	Freshman Year Experience		3	1	3	2	456446	11/12/07	She was very nice...or so it seemed. Gave me a very low grade on the coaching meeting, and when I asked why and what I could do to present myself better, she ignored my e-mail
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	1	456446	4/1/07	She's a really nice and approachable person who's always willing to help. The course itself was kind of a insignificant to some but all you need to do to pass is show up for at least 8 of the 10 classes and do your work. She grades really high. (I honestly think it's either 0 or 100.) It's almost impossible to fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		4	4	4	4	456446	12/4/06	she was good but seriously, this guy definitely used to be a man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	3	456446	11/11/06	Very nice and personable. Most of the class was pointless, but that's not her fault. She tried to make the most of it. Not a lot of homework, and anything we did have was easy. Very helpful if you asked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	3	456446	3/3/06	nice teacher, easy to talk to. if you get her do everything you can to make her pay seven up(she never got around to letting us) good pointless but required class, as long as you do everything your supposed to with enough quality, you'll get an easy A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	456446	10/26/05	class is completly worthless but shes really nice and homework is easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	5	5	5	456446	8/31/05	Great teacher and alot of help if you need it she is there to help you
Rochester Institute of Technology	Karen Violanti	4.4	1	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	2	NULL	456446	9/6/04	Super easy teacher. Attendance mandatory. One on one meetings strange.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business	101	3	4	5	4	1571474	11/19/12	Classes are pretty boring but he's not a bad teacher. He tries to keep things interesting with real-world experience and group activities but the power points are really dry. Overall, good teacher, I'd suggest him, but don't expect an easy A. Read the book!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	0	Business	285	2	1	1	1	1571474	10/31/12	This guy is the worst professor in the College of Business. not approachable, confusing at times, long boring lectures, very unclear of what he wants done and doesn't give much feedback on why he gave you a certain grade. Received an A in his course, but it wasn't easy. must read the texbook. take someone else before you take this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business		3	4	5	1	1571474	11/21/11	Overall he's a great professor. He cares that students are learning in the class. Reading the textbook is mandatory, however. He is a slightly hard grader, but he was kind enough to give me and a couple other students in class a re-write on our essays. He also brought snacks to class, as previously stated! =]
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	0	Business		3	1	2	1	1571474	8/21/11	Tooooooo many USELESS information in his powerpoint that he expected us to read! His lectures are utterly boring. 10, 20, 30 is one of the rules he teaches, yet he really doesn't use that. Just don't take him unless you really have to! :C
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	1	Business		4	3	3	4	1571474	5/21/11	Not a bad teacher, hard to communicate and did not give feedback very well, very hard to see how one lost points on papers and tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business	101	4	4	4	2	1571474	11/7/12	This guy isn't bad. Read the textbook and use the test banks he provides that's where he gets all his test and quiz questions from. Also attend class even though he bores you with his useless stories. He doesn't give quizzes or tests back and teaches new material before giving quizzes which is confusing...but if you read/study easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	1	Business	285	4	2	3	4	1571474	5/21/12	He's a pretty easy grader, but he can be a bit strict. I like how he incorporates real world stories, but he's kind of hard to approach. He's a bit intimidating. He can be unclear of exactly what he wants. I wouldn't suggest taking him as a first choice, but don't be upset if you get a class with him. He's neutral.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business		3	4	4	2	1571474	11/16/11	Overall a good professor. He legitimately cares about students actually learning the material & he does actually want you to read the textbook. The topic is a little boring, but he makes it as fun as possible. He even brought my class some snacks! :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business		4	4	4	5	1571474	5/22/11	Great prof. Grades pretty harsh and doesnt always make it clear why certain points were off. A lot of real world experience. Real nice too
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Vlosky	3.3	2	Business		3	4	4	1	1571474	4/30/11	Professor V is pretty down to earth, but the class is mad boring and the topic is dry. He is a good communicator but grades a little harsh. A good person if your trying to be a entrepreneur. Overall he is pretty chill.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	1642169	1/22/13	I took Design of Experiment (1), I was disappointment after I had seen his teaching method. He is really does not want to help students to learn, just he want to challenge them. I was really had liked statistical courses before I took this course with him. Please avoid to take any course with him as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics	307	2	2	2	4	1642169	1/7/13	is unwilling to help, gives vague responses when answering students' questions. Be prepared to teach yourself the materials if decide to take him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics	307	1	2	2	5	1642169	11/10/11	Not very impressive. Online class with less then 40 minutes average lecture per week for a 3 credit class. Students required to teach themselves the material or fail/withdraw. Very difficult grader with vague questions requiring precise responses. Unpleasant, border-line rude responses on homework and returned tests. Avoid Dr. Joseph Voelkel.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics	307	1	1	1	4	1642169	1/8/13	I have to agree with all of the comments so far. He does not answer the questions directly or simply just tells students that they should already know the materials. Use the textbook constantly for hw but disagree with the author most of the time. Teach yourself or take another professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics	801	3	1	3	4	1642169	5/21/12	I have to agree with the other ratings. He is a total jerk. When you ask him a question, he almost always tells you you should already know how to do it. I found the assignments to be fair but there was not enough practice for anything! There were very few examples. Avoid if possible, definitely!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joseph Voelkel	1.7	0	Mathematics	307	1	2	2	5	1642169	11/10/11	Professor Voelkel's lessons are short (less than 40 minutes on average per week for a 3 credit class). Consequently, students must teach themselves the material. Not sure why we are paying tuition. Seriously. Not much help when asked direct questions. Common to receive vague answers with the comment, "not sure how much clearer this could be".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		4	5	5	4	854698	9/15/09	Most motivational professor I've had in college. Great at teaching helpful things outside the class focus, such as interviewing skills and more. He is so personal that he not only knows your name very quickly, but you get to know other people in the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		5	5	5	5	854698	2/26/08	Voss is the best. Easy class, we didn't even do all the labs, his tests are a little difficult but its an easy A class if you pay attention
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		1	5	5	5	854698	10/25/07	great guy loved his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		4	5	5	1	854698	5/9/07	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		4	4	5	3	854698	5/31/06	had him for a number of courses including rigid. great guy. made class more interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		3	5	5	5	854698	8/21/08	Extremely encouraging and motivating. He is very clear in what will be on exams and makes it easy to learn material because of this. His expectations are very reasonable and more well-rounded than many teachers in technical fields. Best prof I have ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		4	4	5	5	854698	12/3/07	voss is awesome. Gets so into it, dunno what we were supposed to learn in the class, but he taught it well. for the final, gives u all the information in a packet you fill in, then rewrites the packet in question form and thats the test, not too hard at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		1	5	5	5	854698	10/25/07	great guy loved his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Voss	4.8	2	Packaging Science		2	5	4	5	854698	4/26/07	Great teacher! Difficult, but do-able if you take notes and study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	0	Information Technology		5	3	1	2	729054	2/16/13	First half of the course had in class exercises which were just tutorials from the internet. Second half of the course was doing work that you didn't have to attend class for. Rarely explained anything. Easy grader, but terrible class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology	101	5	4	4	1	729054	12/11/10	I took the class having no experience whatsoever with HTML or CSS. That being said, I got an A just by showing up for class and trying. If you ever get stuck, you can always ask him for help during his office hours. There were no quizzes or tests, just projects. Just go to class and you will get an A and learn something too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	1	Information Technology	101	3	2	3	3	729054	5/13/10	Nice professor but never available when you need help. Assumes everyone knows basic html so he moves really fast when showing how to do something. His midterm and final exams are hard even if they are open notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	3	729054	8/31/08	Nice guy. He made this freshman level class interesting, even though I was only re-taking it because prior credits did not transfer from my old school & I knew most of the material already. He is very clear about what you need to do for projects, & if you know the material & finish lab early, you can leave, which is nice when you have a night class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	5	729054	2/12/07	Great professor. He is amazingly clear what he wants and he really teaches you what you need to know. The class actually is not boring and he mixes in a lot of visuals to make the class more at ease like watching videos and playing music during class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	5	729054	10/18/05	Very easy class and interesting too. He is more than willing to help you learn what you need to know. A fun professor to have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	1	Information Technology	206	1	3	2	2	729054	11/17/11	Very disorganized. Didn't provide a syllabus or clear project guidelines. An easy grader though and extremely helpful if you ask. Just not your cup of tea if like to know what you're supposed to be doing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	1	Information Technology	206	5	4	2	3	729054	8/8/10	Nice guy and is sure to give you a good grade if you show up to class and try. He isn't always clear in his lectures, but if you ask him for help, he will help you. He doesn't use a textbook for this class either, which is nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology	206	5	3	4	5	729054	4/28/10	Not a bad guy. Busy work every day, but nothing terrible. Teaches the basics pretty well and is very open to questions. Pretty relaxed and easy class if you have any past experience with HTML or Photoshop. Posts notes and presentations online, as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology		4	4	5	3	729054	4/1/07	The subject matter was relatively easy but he was very approachable when you had a problem. He explains things rather clearly and makes sure to give you back your results on time. He gives you a list of exactly what he wants in the projects. If you follow the guidelines, you'll do really well. He also bought us breakfast for our last class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ronald Vullo	3.8	2	Information Technology	320	5	5	5	3	729054	11/16/06	Vullo is a nice and easy professor for anyone. Classes aren't long and boring, teaches the material well. Good guy, good course
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		2	5	5	5	590996	1/28/13	Good professor, class is a bit difficult if you don't go to his office hours but you'll learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		1	4	3	3	590996	4/28/11	The part that I found difficult was writing the one- act plays about economics on the exams. That and the essay about how poetry has hidden meanings of economics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	1	Economics	211	1	3	3	1	590996	2/24/10	Teacher is rough....Seem like he did too many drugs in his day...knows his stuff but gets too off-topic. Lectures are boring but don't fall behind you will regret. I am about to take his exam now and i think im going to fail.. Advise not taking him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics	325	3	4	4	2	590996	2/17/08	First day, stressed me out--doesn't mind giving D's, very few A's. I don't have a problem with that, but stresses no curve. Term paper: if not in his office by 5:00, it is not accepted. Suggestions: talk in his class, pay attention to lecture and books. Include info from the extraneous reading (Plato, Hume, Beard, etc) as he loves them.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics	453	2	5	4	4	590996	5/6/07	One of the best teachers at RIT imo. Yes the subject can be difficult but he is 100% interested and capable of teaching it to you if you want to learn. He is relaxed, its up to you to put forth the effort. Write down everything he puts on the board and study it, pay attention in class, and you will do well.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics	211	4	5	4	4	590996	10/18/06	I took microeconomics and thought it was great. He really knows what he's talking about. The only tough part about the class was that the only grades were 3 tests, but I did relatively well on all of them and got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		2	4	4	3	590996	9/6/05	seems like a tough teacher but we're here to do work right?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	590996	3/22/12	His class only had 3 tests and a term paper for grades. This made it a no BS class, which I like. You should definitely attend every lecture. He's a good lecturer, and cares about his students a lot. It's not an easy class, but it's not impossible to get an A if you stay on top of things.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	1	Economics	511	2	3	3	1	590996	10/26/10	Ok, he seems like a nice guy but at times he will get off-topic from the book. Just three exams and a term paper. I suggest you to keep in touch with classmates cuz the tests are so hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	1	Economics	211	2	3	3	2	590996	11/19/09	Even though there are only 3 exams and 1 paper for the class,don't fall behind!Lectures aren't boring,very interesting guy.If you show a commitment to learn he will be more than welcome to help you out if you're struggling.I found it to be a hard class,so good luck!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		2	5	4	3	590996	11/20/07	he's a softcore-hardass. The only grades are 3 tests which consist of tricky multiple choices and a couple essays. I was lucky to get a C. Says attendence is optional but don't skip too many classes, you'll start getting lost, and bored in his long winded explainations and stories. You've really gotta take advantage office hours if you struggle
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics	211	3	5	4	3	590996	4/27/07	Tough professor. Pushes his students, stringent grader. If you work hard, you might get an A; if you do, you'll feel like you earned it. Friendly, good explanations, good notes. Helpful at office hours, but he will make you do the heavy thinking (IMO helps you learn it a lot better.) Good stories, gets a bit off topic, so it doesnt get too boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	0	Economics	211	1	1	1	1	590996	11/16/06	F- The worse I ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics	211	3	5	4	4	590996	11/15/06	Fairly difficult class. You have to actually understand the material. If you try and memorize facts, you will fail. Wagner goes out of his way to help you if you want it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	0	Economics		1	1	1	5	590996	5/23/06	Very Very Hard... dont take any class with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeff Wagner	3.4	2	Economics		3	5	5	3	590996	4/5/05	I've had this professor 4 times so far. He's awesome in every way. Has some great life stories to tell. Knows a lot you can learn from, and is willing to help you learn it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kathy Varone	1.5	0	English	101	1	1	2	1	1411081	1/29/11	She do not care about her students. She would not willing to show more support for her students when they need. She not willing to invest more time with her students. She is not qualify teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Vernarelli	4.5	2	Economics		3	5	5	2	1705988	4/12/13	Is a good teacher. Tests are hard but fair. Would strongly recommend reading the text book and doing the homework because test questions are similar to (if not the same as) the homework. He cares about detailed answers, but if you pay attention to the details that he emphasizes in class, you'll know what he's looking for on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Vernarelli	4.5	2	Economics		3	4	5	2	1705988	10/9/12	He makes class interesting with jokes and metaphors, and stops every now and then to clarify stuff we didn't get. He makes sure you get the idea, but his tests are tough (and the grade's bulk). He expects every detail to be in place and really cares about semantics. Class is fun, and you may learn, but it's really hard to do well in tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Vernarelli	4.5	2	Economics		2	4	4	4	1705988	10/16/12	Nice guy, can teach the subject well. But, the test are impossible. He expects every detail to be specific and the class can perform lowly on the exam but still know the subject well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine Verstrate	4.8	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	576188	3/16/07	Elaine is very sweet, she really enjoys teaching and the time that she is able to spend with her students. She definitely does not mess aroundwith deadlines or quality though, you will work hard in her class. It's worth it- you learna lot from her about technique and also about real world illustration work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elaine Verstrate	4.8	2	Fine Arts		4	4	5	4	576188	3/3/05	Very kind and helpful teacher. Just make sure you meet those deadlines she gives you! As long as you hand in decent work on time, you'll probably get at least a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Viggiano	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	5	3	1741634	2/13/13	A very relaxed class (may have to do something with the large cup he carries) but he conveys the material in a clear way at a good pace. It can get dull at times when he does long examples, but more lively when teaching. Viggiano is a SERIOUS nerd - brings a Raspberry Pi to class and rambles about Unix.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Viggiano	3.7	1	Mathematics	319	3	3	2	1	1741634	8/16/12	Took him for Data Analysis 1. He is a nice guy, but he doesn't really do a good job of presenting the material effectively. You'll be asking him for clarification often. Does offer help outside of class, which was nice. Also, the online assignments were helpful in understanding the concepts. The final was graded on a curve, which was nice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Viggiano	3.7	2	Mathematics	319	5	4	4	1	1741634	1/23/13	As most students I was not happy to take Data I. Its boring and dry. He does his best to get your inrest with jokes and humor. He is an easy grader but passionate about the meteral. I would recommend him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Violanti	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		5	5	5	5	346594	9/11/05	He is the best teacher ever!!!! Sadly, he retired:(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	2	Psychology		2	5	5	4	757344	3/15/10	Great Psychology teacher. Very interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	0	Psychology		2	3	1	1	757344	11/8/06	he has met the two I's of horrible teaching-- inept and incompetent-- kudos to him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	0	Psychology		1	1	1	3	757344	11/7/06	horrible teaching skills!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	2	Psychology		5	4	3	3	757344	11/15/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	0	Psychology		3	2	2	2	757344	11/17/06	One of the worst teachers ever at RIT. He is technically a psychology teacher, not a statistics teacher. soo, yea..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	0	Psychology	305	3	1	1	1	757344	11/8/06	never met a unskilled professor like him before! he doesn't help much on the homeworks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Dhanraj Vishwanath	2.4	1	Psychology	350	3	3	2	1	757344	10/22/06	extremely boring in class ...you'll be better off reading the textbook on your own..although when you talk to him one on one he can be helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Vodacek	3.8	1	Imaging Science	215	4	2	3	4	1633051	11/26/11	Pretty dry and boring lectures for Imaging Science Fundamentals. Very scatterbrained when giving a lecture, isn't around during labs. Doesnt seem like he cares too much about the class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anthony Vodacek	3.8	2	Imaging Science	215	4	5	5	3	1633051	10/29/11	He teaches imaging science fundamentals and keeps the class work really low. As long as you do good on the simple labs, an A is simple to get. He also brings in a lot of guest speakers which is fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Allen Vogel	4.2	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	4	736629	1/16/07	At first I was very nervous and not confident in my abilities as a photographer, Allen pushed me to think outside the box and gave me the confidence to do so! He's helpful and informative, laid back and fun, a master at lighting. One of the best teachers I've had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Allen Vogel	4.2	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	4	736629	10/25/05	Vogel knows lighting. His demos are extremely informative and if he doesn't know something, he'll find someone who does... He's a wealth of information, but you have to ask him questions to get that information. He's pretty laid back, so if you need a professor to hand you information and push you to do well, he's probably not the guy for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Allen Vogel	4.2	2	Fine Arts	201	5	4	3	5	736629	11/20/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Vreeland	5.0	2	Theater		5	5	5	5	309909	9/14/05	She is very cool teacher but sometime she had bad attitude. In general, she is very good teacher. I really miss her. I called her "Ms. DRAMA" she always have dramas no matter what.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mary Vreeland	5.0	2	Theater		2	5	5	NULL	309909	12/5/03	Wow. She is intense. Tells it the way it is. Will get on you BUT cuz she cares much. Wants student to do well. Super funny and will listen to students problem but be ready for honest answer! The best dressed teacher here!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phyllis Wade	3.0	1	Humanities		5	3	3	1	1546667	3/7/11	Okay teacher. Choose, if you can't find anyone better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	915732	1/22/13	honestly one of the best math teachers in the whole department, hilarious guy who uses his humor to keep everyone interested. never a dull moment in the class, and on top of that is extremely intelligent and good at teaching and is more than fair with his tests. you will get out what you put in which is rare in this department
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	283	1	5	4	4	915732	2/28/12	Once again, incredible professor to have! I took 282 with him last quarter, and had him again for this class. Teaches very difficult material flawlessly, and when you don't understand the material, is always willing to make sure you understand! He is difficult though, and you cannot get a good grade without going to class and doing the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	915732	1/19/12	Still champ
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	282	2	5	4	4	915732	10/25/11	Difficult professor, but very clear. Lectures explain every concept in detail, with lots of examples to explain all the caveats of calculus. If you want a challenge, take this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	915732	5/20/10	This professor is truly knowledgeable in the field of Mathematics. During my quarter with him, he taught Differential Equations in such a way that allowed me to form connections between virtually all the class material. Instead of just learning each topic within the subject, I learned the subject itself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	5	915732	9/9/09	Easy class, easy tests, but I feel like past the tests, I don't remember how to apply the techniques very well. Basically teaches what'll be on HIS test, and not much else. His students performed poorly on the school-wide final, but it was curved to his class, so I still go an A without doing homework. If this is your last calc, go with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	1	Mathematics	283	1	2	3	1	915732	2/23/09	Homework assigned are often lengthy and difficult, tests are short but hard, also you have only an hour to do the exam so you better be prepared. The professor does go at a fast pace and doesn't seem to slow down. It's best that you know the material before hand or you will have a tough time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	2	915732	1/6/09	Very easy to follow, goes through lots of examples step by step and answers questions about homework or the lecture very well. The time limit on some tests was a little bit ridiculous though, you didn't really have time to work all the way through a lot of the problems.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	915732	11/10/07	Great professor. Teaches you a lot and very well. Youll learn a lot and his lectures are easy to follow. Possible to get A if you go to class and do what youre supposed to. Would recommend him to anyone who wants to learn and get a good grade while doing it. His tests are OK and his HW make you understand the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	3	5	5	4	915732	11/11/06	Easy to get along with and very clear/precise in examples. Manages time well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	915732	7/29/12	Dr. Wahle is one of the most laidback professors I've had. He presents his material in a clear manner and always checks to make sure no questions are going unanswered during lecture. His workshop sessions give you the practice needed to do well on his tests. Offers practice exams and solutions on his website beforehand. Awesome teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	915732	2/1/12	Great Teacher!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	915732	12/5/11	champ
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	3	915732	4/20/11	Excellent teacher. Interesting lectures and the homework really helps you learn the material. Very helpful during office hours and tests aren't that hard. Highly Recommended
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	306	4	5	5	5	915732	5/6/10	Hands down the best professor I've ever had in my life, period. He teaches in a crystal clear manner. The tests and homework are perfectly reasonable. Most of all, he's an amazing & entertaining person. Take him for your classes, no matter what.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	283	3	3	4	4	915732	3/9/09	Great guy, very funny outside of class. is there a pre-req for all math/science profs to be a little "out there?" Anyway, presents formulas and then does examples for 2 hrs. Homework is lengthy, but if you do it all, you get a better understanding of material. solution manual for textbook recommended. tests are hard, borderline impossible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	4	915732	2/16/09	Professor is not that good. Goes at a very fast pace. Doesn't answer questions well. Small workload but exams are often impossible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	282	3	5	5	4	915732	10/19/08	Knows the material exceptionally well, makes math lectures tolerable, decent workload for homework, tests aren't overbearing, a bit goofy but all in good fun. Handles student questions superbly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Chris Wahle	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	4	5	5	4	915732	1/29/07	Great professor. Manages time very well. Covers material in full and answers all questions. Homeworks due usually every week, but not a lot. Very easy grader, usually curves if necessary. You'll learn a lot from this guy. Wish he taught Project-Based II, definitely taking him for Calc III.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mihoko Wakabayashi	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	899961	5/15/09	Wakabayshi Sensai is an awesome teacher. You learn Japanese through actually using it in class. She is nice, and funny, and undertsanding. It seems like you are going at a slow pace all semester then at the end you realize how much you have learned. You have to get up in front of the class everyday but its no big deal because she helps you a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mihoko Wakabayashi	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	899961	11/16/07	She has got to be one of my favorite professors ever. She's nice, very clear when it comes to teaching, cares about the class as well as the individual, and to top it off is an easy grader. I'm taking Beginning Japanese I now, and I already have her lined up for Beginning Jap II. If you're willing to learn a new language in a fun way, take her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mihoko Wakabayashi	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	899961	10/13/06	She's really helpful both in and outside of class. She presents material well and really makes sure that the class gets it. I would definitely take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mihoko Wakabayashi	5.0	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	899961	4/22/08	I had her for Beg Jap I & II & III, one of the best teachers I've had at RIT. Very nice, very clear and easy to understand, and really makes sure the class understands the materials. Very fair grader, participation is the most important grade. Very strong focus on oral presentation of the material, be prepared to participate a few times a class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mihoko Wakabayashi	5.0	2	Languages		4	5	5	4	899961	10/18/07	Took her for Intro III. Very nice lady, clear, and sweet. I would recommend her to anyone who wants to take JP. Daily grades/participation, scattered homework, and many quizzes. Midterm + final. Very fair on grading and turning things in late.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate  Walders	4.0	2	Psychology	210	4	3	5	2	1794509	1/24/13	I'm currently taking an intro to psych class with Kate online. The entire class is structured well, and is VERY organized. Each week, the due dates remain the same. She's also open to any questions. She wants to see you succeed!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marilyn Walker	3.0	1	Writing		2	3	3	3	1287215	10/25/12	I recommend you if you are challenge on this course with her, don't believe what she say when it come to grade that she didn't have it with her... you need it to see what this grade... BEWARE!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Marilyn Walker	3.0	1	Writing	261	3	4	2	4	1287215	5/15/09	She is okay teacher. I wish when she says she will tutoring or offers office hour, hope she mean it! Sometimes, she announced it but she did not show up herself. Her sign language skill still need improve,..but she is patient with students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality		3	5	5	4	558058	10/31/12	CJ is a great man and professor! He is tough, and he will not be nice- but he is only trying to get you to think about the real world. He will pick on you and others but he is joking with you (mostly). Tests are memorization and try to trick you. But study and think carefully & you will do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality	101	4	4	5	4	558058	1/27/11	Cj is the coolest guy you'll ever meet. He is really picking about how you write, only because he wants you to do well. When he says "memorize" he means it. His exams are easy as long as you MEMORIZE the information. There is a lot of HW but it should take <30 min. he is really helpful and kinda crazy but thats what makes him the best! ENJOY :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	4	558058	4/25/08	A professor who knows what he likes and wants is a great relief. His lecture methods are fresh, fun and keep the class interesting. Very generous person.

Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality		5	4	3	3	558058	1/19/05	I had CJ for Space Tourism Development and Basic Computer Applications. If you do the work, you're guaranteed an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality		3	5	4	3	558058	2/2/11	Probably one of the best teachers in the Hospitality department. Lots of experience; yet gives a lot of homework. If you pay attention and do it your guaranteed an A or a B. Highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	3	558058	5/18/10	Great professor. His lectures are interesting, and straight to the point. He assigns a lot of homework, but they are fairly easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	C J Wallington	4.6	2	Hospitality	101	1	5	4	5	558058	4/21/08	Great Professor, He is one of the coolest professor ever.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Amy Walts	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	1405126	10/21/10	Really hard to get A. Makes you do work but you learn a lot. Pushes you to work your best. Her examples are great. Brought pizza for the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	1	Communication		5	2	3	5	1534638	1/23/13	Xiao Wang is a passive professor who doesn't make the class interesting nor important. This greatly disappointed me as PR is my major and interests me greatly. He does a poor job of motivating his students to care about the field or put effort into the class. Easy A but you don't learn anything. Don't take him if you remotely want to be challenged.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	2	Communication		5	5	4	4	1534638	10/31/12	Professor Wang is such a cool professor! His class is pretty easy as long as you read his lecture notes. Two pop quizzes- though he tells you when they will be. Two exams- midterm and final. The exams were easier than the quizzes. HW is easy- but ask for help if you need. He is very understanding and is glad to help!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	2	Communication	421	4	5	4	4	1534638	3/9/12	Took Public Relations. Its a great class. I really enjoyed it. Dr. Wang provides lots of real-world examples. Very organized and fun class. He's also very nice and cares about his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	2	Communication	400	4	5	5	4	1534638	2/14/12	Mass communications class is intereting and good. Prof Wong is extremely nice and friendly. Super cool guy. Grading isn't bad t all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	0	Communication	101	3	1	1	2	1534638	11/14/12	Impossible to understand. He needs to repeat things at least 3 times for everyone to understand.The whole class is often awkward as he tries to understand us. He is a hard grader for no reason and DOES NOT accept anything late. Lectures are 45 min about info learned in other communication classes. Tests are relatively easy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	2	Communication	535	5	5	4	3	1534638	4/26/12	Very easy, nice professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Xiao Wang	3.8	2	Communication	482	5	5	4	2	1534638	2/17/12	Had him for Mass Communications. He is really easy, and funny too. He keeps lectures short then lets you out early. Everything seems to be crystal clear about the course. He cares about his students and tries to keep them engaged. Everything is posted online for later reference. The tests are easy and short. I recommend this professor. A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Severine Ward	4.7	2	Languages		5	5	5	5	1035586	4/24/08	Great prof :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Severine Ward	4.7	2	Languages		4	4	4	4	1035586	3/1/08	Fun and enthusiastic - easy class if you have a history of learning french, but if not, it may be a bit fast. easy grader and good assignments ( hardly any homework)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Severine Ward	4.7	2	Languages	442	4	5	5	5	1035586	3/11/08	Best prof I've had at RIT. Her lectures are interesting and you will learn a lot. She's a very nice person and easy to approach if you have any questions. Definitely take her if you get the chance!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ann Warren	2.5	1	Networking Security & Systems	210	2	3	2	4	1627572	2/5/12	Teacher will ONLY accept documents in word form or will receive a zero. And no late work. I received too many zeros for sending my documents in pages documents. The way she talks is annoying. Only 1 assignment a week which isn't bad and you can leave class early when the lab is done.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	5	5	4	1193667	4/26/09	Very opinionated but is still amusing. Sometimes isn't fair to other people's opinions. Sometimes his facts are wrong. Overall, a great professor. Loves to teach, very passionate. Very funny. Helpful in every way. Never fails to help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	1	Science Technology & Society		4	4	1	1	1193667	2/20/09	He makes it easy to get an A, but you have to suffer through boring lectures, awful readings and his daily political rants against Obama. Get over it! He won! If you can, find a better class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	2	Science Technology & Society		4	4	4	2	1193667	11/17/08	An easy class if you show up and read the study guides. Most of the lectures are long and dry; but they recap everything you need to know from the homework. Nice guy, but again long-winded.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	1	Science Technology & Society	508	3	3	3	1	1193667	2/24/09	Incredibly boring class. Papers due every week, reading material is boring. Lectures are boring. Grading is really easy though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	2	Science Technology & Society		5	4	5	3	1193667	1/22/09	Nice guy. Class pretty much consists of lecture and class discussions. It can be boring at times. However, the work is easy, consisting of weekly chapter critiques and three essays. Easy A if you do the work
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	2	Science Technology & Society		2	4	4	4	1193667	11/15/08	He's a nice guy, but long winded. The class relies heavily on reading! He holds reading quizzes at least once a week and can make or break your grade. The final/midterm are cake, just memorize the study guide. Overall not too difficult, class is all discussion which is sometimes fun, sometimes not. He's a good teacher though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Michael Waschak	3.8	1	Science Technology & Society	212	5	3	2	3	1193667	10/30/08	Very easy professor. Everything that is on the midterm and final is on the study guide for them, like everything, with some questions word for word. The class is boring and seems long, because he doesn't fill it with material (nothing taught in class is on any evaluations) but just goes on tangents for entire blocks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		3	4	2	5	66030	3/15/12	go in for office hours, hes kind of nervous in class, but one on one he'll essentially sit there with you for two hours and explain pretty much anything you want to you. in class he often gets wrapped up in a problem on the board and wont explain all his steps, but in office hours when you can stop him and ask questions, he's the man. Got an A btw.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		1	2	3	3	66030	11/18/11	If you can avoid him, I would. He is a very nice man, and willing to help, but his help is pretty much useless. He clearly knows physics well, but can't explain it in a way that would allow his students to understand. He often skips steps in problems, and conglomerates multiple equations into one giant one. Our TA Johnny was awesome though :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	2	Science		5	4	4	4	66030	10/20/08	Great teacher, Yes he can be unclear at times but I have taken him for physics 1, 2 and hopefully 3! He grades fair, tests are hard but not unreasonable for the topic. Teachers much more "Conceptual" that pure math IMHO. In any class, study & read the book! Nice guys, understanding to needed extensions with good reason. Would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science	311	3	3	3	3	66030	11/25/07	Wagner is a sweetie. However, he's not the greatest teacher (even though he is very good at Physics). His lectures are extremely short; he takes up all of his "lectures" with worksheets (LOTS of worksheets). All in all, Wagner was really nice as a person but just alright as a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		3	1	2	1	66030	2/6/07	avoid at all costs. if you know the material extremely well beforehand then maybe take a class with him. there is no lecture only pointless labs and worksheets. they're not too hard but once you get to his tests, they're nothing like the work you did in class. also good luck getting any sort of help or straight answer from him, it's impossible

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		3	3	2	3	66030	11/17/05	No lectures and lots of worksheets. Not a good combination if you perfer someone to actually explain the concepts to you. He has the looks of Albert Einstein and the sound of Andy Dick. Yes, it is an odd combination.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	5	66030	10/24/05	How about actually preparing a lecture instead of winging it, Wagner? How about talking instead of putting up chicken-scratch, half-wrong calculus on the chalk board? This guy put me in 3 horrible lab groups and kept doing it even after I complained to him. I would rather drop out than take another class with him, and I'm a straight-A student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		3	3	3	4	66030	11/11/04	Nice guy, but it's hard to understand him sometimes. I'd say that doing all the worksheets helps, but since he gives out up to 4 a day, that can be almost impossible sometimes. Also he's not very helpful when you ask him questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	2	Science		3	5	5	3	66030	10/20/04	very nice, very helpful, very interesting to listen to, willing to take his time to help, able to know you by face in a class of 60
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science	311	2	2	2	4	66030	2/28/12	Having entered the class with AP knowledge, lecture material was useless to the knowledge of the subject. Used worksheets for 3/4 of the classes, and these were the only way to reinforce my knowledge. Nice guy with good intentions, but lectures are some of the worst I've had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science	389	1	1	1	3	66030	3/21/11	Nice person. HORRIBLE TEACHER. He knows what he's talking about, but no one else does because he trails into silence halfway through every third sentence. Mumbles, writes incomprehensibly, cannot answer any content-related questions. Very approachable, but still cannot help even outside of class. DO NOT TAKE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		3	2	3	3	66030	3/18/08	Decent, based on what I've encountered from the Physics Department at RIT. He can't really explain anything if you don't understand it, but he goes through all the examples he hands out, so you at least have a chance. There were only a couple lab reports and the only other homework was weekly webassign. Very entertaining. You needn't avoid.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	3	66030	5/21/07	He uses worksheets to teach, no explanations on anything, just worksheets. Then expects one person in your group to understand the worksheet and help the others. Also I agree, this man cannot explain what he teaches. Nice personality, he'll shoot the**** with you outside class, but inside class your on your own. :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		5	4	2	1	66030	2/8/06	He is possebly the most boring teacher you can get but stay awake and then his class is easy. None of the huge projects that the other classes have. Much less work than any other teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		1	2	1	2	66030	11/25/05	Perhaps the most aggravating teacher I've ever had. The only thing harder than his tests is getting a straight answer out of him. Brilliant, but rarely teaches and relies too heavily on worksheets and web assign to make you understand the material. Take him only if you know the subject already.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	1	Science		2	2	3	5	66030	11/9/05	He is alright, although he can only explain certain information in a limited ammount of ways. Therefore if you dont get "it" the first time with this guy he probably will never be able to explain it to you, no matter how many times you see him after class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		1	1	1	1	66030	11/18/04	This guy is horrible. He couldn't teach a dog to beg for scraps. Instead he would give him a worksheet on what frequency the dog is whining at. Totally unhelpful, doesn't do a good job at answering questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	0	Science		2	2	2	5	66030	10/26/04	very, very, very boring. DO NOT TAKE A MORNING CLASS WITH HIM! he's a nice guy and knows his stuff, but talks so slow that he can't hold my attention. If you have a morning class with him, you will fall asleep. On the bright side, he does look like Albert Einstein.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	2	Science		3	5	5	NULL	66030	11/6/03	Cool dude, get him talking about organic farming
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	2	Science		4	5	5	NULL	66030	2/10/03	Wagner is one cool cat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jerome Wagner	2.7	2	Science		4	4	4	NULL	66030	10/1/02	Overall cool guy. will curve test and lenient with due dates.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gretchen Wainwright	4.2	2	Civil Engineering	101	3	4	4	4	1628688	2/21/13	I dislike her teaching style. She tends to just read off of power points. She is very knowledgeable about the topics covered though and enthusiastic. The biggest downfall is she doesn't let you keep your tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gretchen Wainwright	4.2	2	Civil Engineering	352	3	5	4	4	1628688	10/19/11	Wastewater management: She's new, but very very knowledgeable and helpful. The class material is useful in the future, but she's making it in a hard way. I like her personally and will have her again next quarter. weekly assignment, 2 tests+1final, 1 group project,1 field trip(not required to go). :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Wake	4.1	1	Philosophy		5	2	3	2	986372	2/18/08	really boring teacher. easy A class though. tests are easy. most of the kids fell asleep. easy assignments. i hated the lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Wake	4.1	2	Philosophy	101	4	5	5	2	986372	10/29/07	Keeps class interesting, awesome sense of humor. Definitely worth taking
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Wake	4.1	2	Philosophy		4	3	5	3	986372	12/2/07	Good sense of humor, but the class can sometimes drag. She gives out extra credit and grades fairly. Her only fault is that she tends to really, really take the material too slow. Pretty good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Wake	4.1	2	Philosophy	213	5	5	5	4	986372	5/3/07	Easiest A I have had since elementary school
Rochester Institute of Technology	. Walinski	3.2	0	English		2	2	1	2	769666	2/7/06	She doesn't know what she wants. She is constantly running around in circles with her lectures and she doesn't really teach us anything. Bascially she just wants us to suffer, or that's what I've gotten from this class. That 20 pg research paper is retarded. I would like her to actually explain what she wants from her assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	. Walinski	3.2	2	English		4	5	5	3	769666	12/2/05	This class was good. You learn and its easy. There are two huge essays but there not that bad. As long as you show you took the time to write the essay she could care less about what its actually about. She only cares about effort. Which unfortunately means showing up to class. She burns people who dont show for class. Overall good class, dont drop
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tywanquila Walker	5.0	2	Psychology	350	2	5	5	3	1698179	11/2/12	Great prof. Class is hard but easy to pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tywanquila Walker	5.0	2	Psychology	350	3	5	5	3	1698179	8/18/12	She was quite helpful and understanding. Do all of the homework and labs and you will be okay. We go over them before class everyday which was great. There is also a tutor if you fall behind.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tywanquila Walker	5.0	2	Psychology	440	4	5	5	5	1698179	10/26/12	Really great professor! Clear and concise. She really made the class easy and the tests are based from her powerpoint slides so that you don't have to read the book. She tends to give out a list of essay topics before the test and picks from that list. Very understanding and laid back in terms of papers and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tywanquila Walker	5.0	2	Psychology	210	4	5	5	2	1698179	3/5/12	Intro to Psych online. Clear with all requirements, grading seems a bit lenient but she's new so that'll probably settle in as time goes by. Answers emails promptly and with answers to whatever you've asked, is on mycourses constantly, grades come in promptly (with helpful comments on essay questions!). Great professor, highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wayne Walter	2.9	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	158060	2/17/13	Had him for statics and mechanics of materials. He is such a sweet guy who obviously loves teaching. He speaks kinda low, so make sure you sit near the front. Writes very big and moves at a slower pace than most professors, so you can keep up even after zoning out a bit. I really felt like he covers everything well, and at a great pace. Take!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wayne Walter	2.9	0	Engineering	336	1	1	1	4	158060	9/19/12	Very vague and unclear lecture and examples. Homework problem difficulty far beyond anything covered in class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Wayne Walter	2.9	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	158060	11/9/12	Dr. Walter is a good professor. Does examples out in class. The course is challenging. His quiz and exam questions are straightforward and make sense. All material on homeworks, quizzes and exams will have been covered in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Wayne Walter	2.9	2	Engineering	672	1	4	3	4	158060	4/29/10	Had him for dynamics of machinery, class is ridiculously difficult, not in math but in how to actually determine problems based on geometry. Buy a protractor first day. Walter teaches with notes on overhead making material hard to pick up. Homework is difficult and time consuming. Walter's office hours are useful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Wambach	5.0	2	Information Technology	402	4	5	5	2	1565327	7/21/11	Great Professor. Great Guy. Funny and keeps lectures interesting. The only reason why I said easiness was a 3 was that 402 is a tough course. You want Mark as your professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	101	4	5	5	3	669593	4/5/13	Very good teacher! He's very clear on what is going to be on the test and wants all of the students to pass. His lectors can be boring lol
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	101	4	5	5	4	669593	2/19/13	Great professor! Very direct about what will be on the test, even narrowing it down to specific vocab. As long as you skim the texts, and use the study guides in the back of the book, you should be find. Requires Biz Sim project but gives lots of time to work with your group and often lets you go at least 10 mins early!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	101	3	4	4	3	669593	11/7/12	Great Professor. Lectures are interesting and all material is straight out of the book. Not necessarily an easy A, but you'll learn a lot, and he's very willing to help students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	260	3	5	5	4	669593	3/17/12	Excellent professor! He is extremely clear in class, and he is always willing to help outside of class. His tests aren't bad as long as you pay attention. The first half of the class is devoted to lecture and the second half is for group work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	4	3	669593	2/16/12	Ward is awesome. Definitely recommend taking a class with him if possible. He is very clear with what is on the tests and what he expects for assignments. Easy A or B. I love his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	4	669593	1/26/12	Amazing teacher, creates a very positive learning environment. Doesn't clear the theory test aspect clearly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	450	2	5	5	1	669593	10/13/11	Took Ward for marketing in a global env. GREAT teacher. he does ask you to do a lot of analyzing on papers, but he is sooo helpful. such a great teacher and definitely one of my favorite teachers at RIT. LOVE him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	250	5	5	5	3	669593	4/27/11	The class is pretty elementary and can get really boring if you've taken any other business classes. That said Ward really knows what he is talking about and is really helpful and insightful when you ask him for help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	4	5	4	669593	11/20/10	You have to write 3 essays for his class which can be a bit challenging, but not too hard as long as you let him look it over. There is a midterm and final which are multiple choice/ short answer, both very easy because he tells you what will be on it. If you put a lot of effort into the papers and study his study guides, you should get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	4	5	669593	5/9/10	he is an awesome professor he is so helpful but he git some problems in explanation , overall he's great and i highly recommend you to take some classes with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	5	669593	2/19/13	Prof Ward is the man. Nuff said
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	101	5	5	5	5	669593	11/17/12	As an intro teacher, he is GREAT. He is there because he wants to be and love teaching. He gets back grades to you within 12 hours! He has TONs of business experience and got confused ZERO times in the entire course. His humor is also amusing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	102	4	5	5	4	669593	5/1/12	Great teacher, clearly describes topics and fair grader. Very willing to help and tests are pretty straight forward. Would definitely recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	250	5	5	5	4	669593	3/13/12	great teacher, very helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		5	5	3	4	669593	2/6/12	Great teacher. It's easy to get an A in his class if you pay attention in class. Tests are pretty straightforward. He assigned you a group that you have to work with for projects for the quarter. Take him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	1	Business	260	2	3	3	5	669593	11/3/11	Tests are hard. Must read the chapters in order to do well. Hard grader on projects. Need to study ALOT in order to do well on tests. Test questions are very specific. Do not like the class at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	363	4	5	2	4	669593	8/21/11	NOTE for all students who love details and clarity when it comes to homework assignments, Ward doesn't really do well on explaining what he expects from homework assignment. Very often, his explanations about homework goes off the homework assignment, which resulted in bad grades for homework, ultimately dragging my A to B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		3	5	4	4	669593	3/7/11	Very interesting class. Lectures can be boring, but he tries to keep the class engaged with videos and exercises. 3 papers are a majority of the grade, but he is very helpful outside of class and you will get a better grade if you seek help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	113	4	4	4	4	669593	5/23/10	Great prof. class can be a bit boring, but overall good
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	250	4	4	5	4	669593	3/9/10	Very nice professor, easy grader. Gives good overview of the business world. Group projects can get a little confusing but he is very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	2	669593	1/26/10	AWESOME professor!!! He was the first professor of my freshman year -- he is funny and keeps things focused but not in a mean way. READ the text, you will be just fine!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	4	4	3	669593	2/14/09	Relate-able, understanding and knowledgeable. Tests are alright if you study. Runs power points based on textbook, and 2 projects simultaneously. Sometimes difficult to manage projects and reading. Will meet outside of class and is casual. Nice grader if he thinks you are capable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	102	5	5	5	5	669593	11/17/08	Awesome professor, I took World of Business class with him. Extremely recommended. Not a hard grader, class was not boring at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	4	669593	10/20/08	BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! I really enjoyed his class. HE incorporates his personal experience, and makes classes very interesting. Even after I finished his class, I still visit him sometimes for advice in business classes. Take him! You won't regret it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	101	4	5	5	5	669593	8/14/08	Dr. Ward's teaching is EXCEPTIONAL! He's very clear on what's expected, what should be studied for exams, and how he's going to grade everything. It may seem like he's only talking concepts from a power point at first, but he really forces you to understand the application of concepts and to know what certain terms mean in the real business world.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	5	669593	2/28/07	gives out notes, test come straight from them and some questions from book. Good personality but if you fall asleep easy you may have problems staying awake
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		3	5	5	4	669593	5/3/06	awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	5	669593	3/1/06	Great Class, very clear, presents on powerpoint and gives you the print outs. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy, just study. Good Guy, curves in parts where everyone bombs. DO THE HW, you will benefit! Only downfall is he wont give you the class notes til the end of class, so you can't take notes on them as he goes along... I recommend Prof Ward
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	4	4	5	669593	11/16/05	Great class, kinda boring teacher, but pretty staright forward and easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	0	Business		1	1	1	4	669593	7/6/09	he does not have a good understanding about cultural differences. unnecessarily authorative.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business	260	4	5	5	3	669593	11/17/08	Ward is a very good professor. Notes and lectures are clear and explains everything very well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	4	4	5	669593	11/14/08	GOOD professor. Very easy and straight forward. Drops lowest test and quiz grade. Tests str8 from book. Very easily get an A. He helps his students a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		3	5	5	5	669593	9/25/08	He is a phenomenal teacher with great experience. He is pretty much the best prof. I have encountered at RIT. He's just amazing
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		4	5	5	4	669593	10/12/07	This class really helped me understand more about the business industry. He is a great teacher, very helpful, very clear and easy to understand. The tests come from the notes, no suprises. I actually enjoyed this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		5	5	5	5	669593	11/16/06	A+ Do the homework and U will be Okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		3	5	5	4	669593	4/27/06	Great professor, teaching method is very straightforward, brings personal experience and relates it to the course topics. What's on the tests is what you go over in class and read. If you do the work & reading the class is easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Ward	4.5	2	Business		3	4	4	3	669593	2/20/06	Very clear and straightforward but dry teacher. Not that great but not that bad either.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Warfield	5.0	2	Theater		4	5	5	5	567318	10/29/10	He's awesome!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Warfield	5.0	2	Theater		5	5	5	5	567318	9/14/05	he is so awesome teacher of all. Very sweet and generous. Everyone start loving him now because he always make them laugh and comfortable while warming up in class. he is A+. I recommand you guys to take his course and he is teaching in NTID dance. GO and try it out. it's fun and you will like him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Warfield	5.0	2	Theater	101	3	5	5	1	567318	1/26/08	Over 20 years of learning life, love and compassion from this man. Glad to have him as a consent teacher in my life. L
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Warfield	5.0	2	Theater		5	5	5	5	567318	2/8/05	Very flexible and kind. He gently showed me the right dance moves whenever I made a mistake. I had tons of fun in this class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages	227	3	5	5	2	477492	5/16/11	Sharon is pretty flexible and is an excellent teacher for a boring, required class. Her assignments aren't too hard to do. There is usually at least one reading a week out of the textbook, but she won't call on you if you don't volunteer. There's no test on the textbook info.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	1	Languages		2	3	3	2	477492	3/4/10	This professor is nice but talks way too much. Gives out good grades where it is deserved.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	0	Languages		3	1	3	4	477492	9/25/08	I don't even know where to start here...This teacher is unapproachable, refuses to help or clarify anything that is too "elementary" and tells you to go online and figure it out yourself. Horrible attitude problem overall, seems constantly miserable. Grading IS fair....purely on a X/Y point scale. But class is boring- Just teaches out of textbook.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		4	4	5	4	477492	3/4/05	Class requires some modivum of writing but she tells you exactly what she expects. The class is relatively easy to get a good grade as long as you show up and do the work. Instructor is interesting and lively debates tend to take up most of the class which she encourages to reinforce the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		4	5	5	2	477492	5/15/11	Awesome professor. She presents boring material in a funny/interesting way, and will help you to the best of her ability if you approach her. Assignments had very clear guidelines, graded fairly. Would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		4	4	5	3	477492	4/27/09	I loved this professor. She made learning a very boring topic bearable. Grading was extremely fair as she told you exactly what she wanted ahead of time. She seems grumpy and super strict at first but overall she is very nice. One of the best writing professors I have had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		3	4	4	1	477492	3/15/06	Good teacher, Boring class, Boring Topic. It's a required class for rit so what do you expect. She doesn't give an overabundance of work. Final for class is a research paper which is relatively easy to do. I would recommend her if you want an A or possible B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		4	4	5	4	477492	3/7/05	An overall good professor. Tolerates dumb comments/answers suprisingly well, but avoid asking her a question she has already answered, or you may get hurt. Gives approx. 4 essays and grades fairly easy. Tells exactly what's on the midterm and final. Her lectures somehow manage to be interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Sharon Warycka	4.2	2	Languages		4	4	4	4	477492	10/23/04	She's very fair and clear on her expectations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Waterman	4.5	2	Freshman Year Experience		3	5	5	1	1621930	4/3/12	He is very serious and has a military background. His class has three goals: To work in a group, experience long term project management, and have opportunity to speak/present in front of the class. The actual topic of the class doesn't matter. He grades on those goals, but not on the overal project.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Waterman	4.5	2	Freshman Year Experience	101	4	5	4	1	1621930	11/19/11	He gave less homework than the other discovery teachers but attendence is manditory.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Waterman	4.5	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	4	4	1621930	11/22/11	He is a chill, nice guy. Is not strict or unreasonable. Treats class as a constructive discussion.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lawrence Waterman	4.5	2	Freshman Year Experience		5	4	5	1	1621930	10/26/11	Good educator, but the mandatory nature of the coursework makes the class ultimately unsatisfying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	0	Information Technology	350	3	1	2	2	808531	2/25/13	He might have been once really intelligent, but all of his information seems to be at least 10 years outdated. Nice guy, but doesn't do anything besides read off of powerpoints that he stole from other profs then let the TAs run the lab. Usually gets distracted by talking about random topics during lectures. Easy class if you just do what he says.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	0	Information Technology	350	1	1	1	4	808531	1/3/11	I had him for Comp Sys Fund. All of the previous posts are so accurate. He's an awful professor. His lectures are terrible. He spends most of the time asking "How many of you _?" questions, that are totally meaningless. He's very unclear about assignments and his grading is terribly unfair. Avoid this professor at ALL costs, seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	0	Information Technology	350	2	2	2	2	808531	12/3/07	Professor did not much care for students.Took a very long time to grade work. Grading(especially on papers) was not very fair.It seemed like he would try to find your weaknesses in your work more than your strengths,and he would try to take away points rather than try to give you somewhat of a grade.Was not very knowledgeable of the class subject.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	0	Information Technology	350	2	1	1	3	808531	2/14/11	Better known as Professor What. Makes no sense, had to ASK him to go back and check the computerized mid-term for computer error (there was a LOT), does not clarify mistakes in homework, nor clarify what he wants from papers. Hard grader. Terrible lecturer. DO NOT TAKE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	1	Information Technology		2	2	3	4	808531	12/3/07	DOES NOT ROUND GRADES, I received a 89.79 and got a B. He lectured off power point, and just read what was there, and he didn't post them so you have to take notes. He is pretty strict, so don't miss any assignments.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Robert Watt	1.5	0	Information Technology	350	2	1	1	4	808531	10/17/07	He is real lazy. You can defiantly tell this is his second job. He puts all the work on online for you to find and figure out. Then he'll just go on rambling about his servers and his job. He takes forever to grade your work, and really doesn't care.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		3	5	5	4	67457	4/27/09	Excellent professor, one of the best teacher's I've ever had :D
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		1	5	5	4	67457	3/10/08	good teacher, very strict at the moment of grading
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		1	5	5	5	67457	10/31/06	very good teacher, has expectations, tough he will guide you through the class, a teacher i wouldn't hesitate to take. had two classes with him, and will hopefully have more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		5	5	4	5	67457	11/17/05	Very good lab instructor. Easy to follow and very helpful. Overall nice man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		2	5	4	5	67457	5/10/08	great teacher, really nice with everyone, but he is very hard grader and makes u read a lot. i love his classes, i already took 4 of them and i will take more
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science	253	2	5	5	5	67457	8/22/07	Great lab teacher! He is in environmental science, but really helped us Bio and Biotech majors. He is very strict (don't come in late and try to hand the pre lab in) and don't be stupid. He will help you as much as he can and is very nice. Beware the beard! ;p
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Waud	4.8	2	Science		3	5	4	4	67457	12/1/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Weinstein	4.8	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	1257261	10/17/10	He is the coolest teacher in the world!! He is extremely helpful in office hours, he'll explain things until they make sense and you can prove you can do the problems by yourself. Plus he's amazingly nice and cares about his students. He's very enthusiastic about the material too. Lectures can be a bit rambling, but he gets the point across.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steven Weinstein	4.8	2	Engineering	102	4	5	4	3	1257261	2/25/09	Down to earth guy, super friendly and helpful. Sometimes drones a bit in lectures but typically real easy to understand- glad he was chosen to start the chemical engineering program.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	351	4	5	4	4	1451286	5/26/12	Great Professor. Knows his stuff and wants to share it through everyone. Brings real life experiences into the classroom.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	515	4	5	5	4	1451286	2/22/12	He is really energetic and willing to help out his students. You can't go wrong taking one of his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	5	5	5	5	1451286	11/9/11	Had him for cyber self defense. He's got great presentations, and he is very passionate about his subject. He's happy to respond to emails related to the topics. He recommends some great books and resources. Very passionate about his subject. I am hoping to have him again for other classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	515	4	5	5	5	1451286	10/28/10	Just commenting to repeat what has already been said. If you're looking to take Intro to Routing & Switching, Professor Weissman is who you want. Crystal clear powerpoints with tons of examples. The labs are fun and the tests make sure you understand the concepts, rather than reciting facts.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	515	3	5	5	5	1451286	8/3/10	AWESOME teacher. Super enthusiastic, ALWAYS reachable outside of class - genuinely passionate about making learning fun and getting through to students. Works his ass off for the students and bettering the department and course (had him for Intro Routing & Switching).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	515	4	5	5	5	1451286	3/2/12	One of the best professors I've ever had at RIT. I would be glad to have him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	5	5	5	3	1451286	1/30/12	Weissman made an otherwise awful and uninteresting class useful and informative (4050-220 cyber self defense). He's an interesting and engaging lecturer, even at 8:00 AM.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	220	5	5	5	5	1451286	10/27/11	He is a great teacher. If you don't understand something then he'll give you an example that is easy to understand. Gives fun little labs that are interesting and relate directly to the material. One of my favorite teachers!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	351	4	5	5	3	1451286	10/25/10	AWESOME professor. When he lectures, he'll explain things multiple ways until everyone gets it. Always extremely helpful and knows what he's talking about. Doesn't let you down when it comes to exams/quizzes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jonathan Weissman	4.9	2	Networking Security & Systems	515	4	5	4	5	1451286	6/1/10	Great teacher for Routing and Switching, very enthusiastic. Highly recommend taking 515 with him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Wells	2.0	0	Languages		5	1	2	3	916208	11/19/07	i had her for one class and she is not fair with her grading. very unorganized and teaches from power point.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Wells	2.0	0	Languages		3	1	2	5	916208	3/12/07	A very nice person, however, quite disorganized. Only gives feedback in writing, not much advice in person.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Wells	2.0	1	Languages		5	3	3	3	916208	6/2/07	I can't stand taking her classes. If you like unorganized people, then she's great. To say she's slow at grading is an understatement. Nice person, but horrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric Wendorff	4.0	2	Culinary Arts		3	4	4	5	1697146	3/1/12	Foods wasn't quite what I expected. Professor is very condescending. First quiz in the class wasn't fair at all. Lectures are monotonous and dry, you sit there for 1 1/2 hours then you get to eat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul  Wenger	4.5	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	4	1757631	4/12/13	I had him for Discrete Math I, and I learned more in that class than I though possible. As long as you are willing to learn he is willing to go the extra mile to help. The homework is pretty tough, but the tests aren't that bad. He is really good at describing complicated things in a way that's easy to understand, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul  Wenger	4.5	2	Mathematics	265	4	4	4	4	1757631	10/25/12	Tests are relatively easy, quite a bit easier than the HWs. It's his first year at RIT and his first time teaching this course and did a great job. There's 10 HWs worth 20% (drops the lowest score), a group project worth 10%, 3 exams each worth 15%, and the final which is worth 25%. He makes up the HWs, they're not from the textbook.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul  Wenger	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	5	3	1757631	2/24/13	Professor Wenger presented material clearly, and he was helpful during office hours. If you want an A, you'll have to work for it. The workload is light, but he's a tough grader on proofs. I had a 4.0 until I took this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	72688	9/2/05	amazing professor! because of my year with him, i went on to work in an architecture firm with a graphic design degree. learned more from him than my whole stint at rit.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		1	5	3	NULL	72688	11/18/03	this guy can teach your architecture - learn from it - work hard - and learn to love architecture with a passion!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	NULL	72688	5/8/03	He's the man, loves his shizzle
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		4	4	5	NULL	72688	2/12/03	architecture
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	0	Fine Arts		1	1	1	5	72688	5/22/05	i was disapointed when I took his class - he was rude, and wasn't helpful at all!!! dont take his class when you don't have a car - you'll be doing a lot of outside work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		2	3	5	NULL	72688	5/8/03	*boring* teacher. i could not stop zoning out esp since it was an 8am class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Houghton Wetherald	4.1	2	Fine Arts		5	5	5	NULL	72688	10/22/02	good teacher, makes it easy by giving study sheets material to be tested on
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin F Wheeler	4.2	2	Engineering	101	3	4	3	5	1753539	12/10/12	Super Amazing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Benjamin F Wheeler	4.2	2	Engineering	101	4	5	5	5	1753539	12/10/12	He's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesse Wasson	4.1	2	Political Science		4	5	5	3	1487806	10/17/11	Took Comparative Politics with him. He's a very well-organised lecturer. Take his PPT notes, they WILL appear in the exam, which he provides study guides for. Enjoyed the class. Also, the eye candy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesse Wasson	4.1	2	Political Science	513	4	4	5	4	1487806	4/20/11	Awesome professor, very easy to understand. If you show up to class and pay attention to the presentation, you will get an A with very little effort. Extremely light course work, but I wouldn't say you don't learn anything - there's just no busywork. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesse Wasson	4.1	2	Political Science	101	3	5	5	2	1487806	5/5/11	Extremely great class! He was very helpful and experienced, not to mention hot!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jesse Wasson	4.1	0	Political Science		2	2	2	1	1487806	2/5/11	Hard to understand, uses big words. the material covered is random and every class is a lecture with powerpoint slides. International Relations is not an easy A, only graded on a midterm, one research paper, and the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	2	Biology		5	3	5	3	1028279	11/16/12	Extremely easy for Human Biology. Grade is only based on exams. Her lectures are pretty boring, but she always posts her slides online. She is a sweetheart as well. Very nice to all her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	2	Biology		5	5	5	5	1028279	11/26/11	Medical Terminology was really easy. Self paced and you do it on your own time. 300 question final was nuts though! Highly reccomend if you need a 2 or 3 credit Liberal Arts (Gen Ed) filler!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	1	Biology		3	3	3	3	1028279	5/13/11	Very nice online class, it is so good if you know the material. I never meet her, that all about it :). But if you really need this class you can take it. This is all right believe me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	2	Biology		5	3	5	3	1028279	11/2/12	Easy class, everything is on the powerpoints. Teacher is boring, learned more from powerpoints than listening to her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	1	Biology	101	5	1	5	1	1028279	6/23/11	I took her online class Medical Terminology- SO EASY. If you actually want to learn the material the course is probably hard, but it's great if you're looking for a quick and easy online class. I finished the course in two days and received an A and four credits.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kristen Waterstram-Rich	3.8	2	Biology		5	2	5	5	1028279	6/18/08	Was scheduled as a classroom course but it turned out it was online. Super easy class-- you can pretty much do ALL of it in 8 hours on the last day if you put it off like I did. Easy quizzes you take repeatedly until you get 100 and the final (worth 50% of your grade) is simple as well. Easy class, easy grade. Take it if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		5	4	4	3	283168	7/22/07	He's an awesome professor, although I feel we could have covered more. His projects were cool and he gave us a number of days off. If you want a pretty laid back imaging class, take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	1	Graphic Arts		4	3	2	1	283168	2/20/06	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	283168	8/30/05	i would have a drink with this man anyday
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	3	3	283168	12/14/04	Mark is the most approachable and helpful professor this school has. He will spend hours teaching you until you comprehend the subject matter. Yes, he likes his "smokes" but doesn't mind talking to students while smoking. If you get the chance, do not miss out on a class with him.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		4	4	3	2	283168	5/16/07	Watts is 'awesome'. The problem with this class however is I feel I could've learned a lot more. We did in 10 weeks what would probably be a 3 hour tutorial online by most standards. He knows a lot about photography and photoshop. He is a good guy with cool ideas. We played croquet one day...that was fun. His quiz was real tough though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		5	5	5	5	283168	9/9/05	Watts is the man, very good advisor also. Just wished he checked his e-mail a bit more...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		2	5	5	5	283168	8/30/05	i would have a drink with this man anyday
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	0	Graphic Arts		1	1	2	NULL	283168	9/5/04	DO NOT TAKE A CLASS FROM HIM! Not up on the current software out there. Should stop smoking cigaretts 'cause he's all about his cigarette breaks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Mark Watts	3.8	2	Graphic Arts		3	5	5	NULL	283168	8/28/04	Best teacher... You got to get him
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified		4	5	5	4	161495	11/14/12	Great professor. Knows her stuff and presents it well to the class. Understands which topics are difficult to grasp at first and works around her schedule to make sure students understand a topic. Goes thru and gives great example problems, step by step, explaining everything. Helpful outside of class. Enjoyable and slightly challenging class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified	360	5	5	5	2	161495	11/8/10	All the material is presented in very clear terms. Between the powerpoints, many in class examples, crystal clear explanations of concepts, availibilty during office hours, and practice excercises and homeworks that not only cover everything that was covered in class, but also prepare you for tests there is no reason to not learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified	360	4	4	3	5	161495	12/3/07	She's a fantastic teacher! If you're taking Intro to Database and Modeling, take her!! You won't regret a thing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified	720	3	5	5	5	161495	8/3/06	Great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified		3	5	5	NULL	161495	3/7/03	She's an amazing professor. She's nice and you learn a lot in her class. I'd recommend her to anyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified	360	5	5	5	3	161495	3/6/12	One of the best professors in the entire IT department. Extremely helpful, really knows her stuff, goes out of her way to work with students. She takes feedback at the start of the class and really listens. Excellent professor, easy A if you come to class and pay attention and do the homework/PEs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified	360	5	5	5	3	161495	11/3/08	Fantastic teacher...for the most part its interesting, and with the PE's and HW's you're very well prepared for the tests and what we're talking about in class. Anyways, simply fantastic for database fundamentals
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified		3	3	4	4	161495	11/12/07	Elissa Weeden is a nice lady. She isn't the most helpful person I've ever met though, I feel like she has a lot on her plate and is not good with email (often answering them rudely or not at all). The class was enjoyable and I learned a lot. She was extremely helpful on the final practical and gave us one hour extra. I'd take her again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elissa Weeden	4.7	2	Not Specified		4	5	5	NULL	161495	7/15/04	Very helpful. Good at explaining tricky concepts. She made an information technology class seem easy to a bunch of art majors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	4	4	2	1189349	5/17/12	This class is a joke, but Harris tries to keep it interesting. The labs are really easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	5	1189349	2/28/12	Harris is awesome. Lots of experience, always willing to help. Don't be afraid to talk to him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	5	3	1189349	2/16/12	Really knows his stuff. Will go on tangents often. midterm and final online. I definitely recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	4	3	1189349	1/24/12	Had him for Comp Sys Fund (350) and he really knows what he is talking about. This guy has years of experience under his belt and he knows so much about anything electronic or electrical, not to mention mainframes. Great teacher, helpful, and he has such a passion for teaching. Don't use lingo in his class though! He doesn't like that. Midterm easy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	4	5	5	1189349	11/12/11	Class is very easy. His lectures are somewhat entertaining because of his stories and general sarcastic tone. He is a lazy grader and will give you full credit for making an effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	360	5	5	4	5	1189349	7/23/11	Harris is a great guy to talk with. The Department has him teach 3-5 classes and he commutes from 2 hours away. While he may not seem that enthusiastic, he definitely cares and does his best for driving 4 hours a day. He teaches Info Sec Policies really well and isnt bad at all for 350 (CSF)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology	350	3	2	2	2	1189349	10/18/10	miserable and very lazy professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology		2	1	1	3	1189349	5/20/10	Avoid this teacher if you want to learn anything. He is very very(extremely)LAZY, and don't like to help in lab. He knows the stuff and is capable of helping the students but he rather sit there and play his game instead of helping. He is bias toward some students, usually little bit nicer to females. He is one of the laziest teacher I had at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology		3	4	3	3	1189349	2/27/10	Decent prof for all intro level courses. All midterms/finals are online. Lazy grader
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology		4	3	3	2	1189349	2/2/10	He is an alright teacher. I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	5	4	1189349	5/17/12	Awesome professor. Knows what he's talking about. Very kind and approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	5	5	5	4	1189349	2/24/12	Great professor. Does-not-take-crap type. Entertaining. Seriously into what he does, and will encourage discussion and thought.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	220	5	5	4	4	1189349	2/16/12	Reads from powerpoint, but adds his own info here and there. Goes off on many tangents with his thousands of stories. but as long as you read the power points you will be good to go. also, midterm and final online.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	585	5	3	4	5	1189349	11/26/11	Had Harris for 585 Auditing Lab. Would have liked more feedback on the graded audit reports. Just gives you credit for trying.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	350	4	4	4	4	1189349	11/10/11	Weisman is a great professor, despite what most people are saying on here. He is very knowledgeable about the classes he teaches and he is very enthusiastic about some topics. He likes to have fun and joke in class, which makes a mundane required class a little easier to live through. Pay attention and do your labs, easy good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	220	5	5	4	3	1189349	11/30/10	Friendly, uses a lot of real world examples. Occasionally has issues using his Mac, but otherwise on top of things. Assignments are easy, exams are exactly what he says and what's in the notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology		3	1	2	3	1189349	7/23/10	I have had over 40 professors during my college career thus far and without a doubt, Harris, ranks in the bottom three. He is extremely lazy and only pays attention to you if you know about as much as he does. Favors the 'teach yourself' approach, although it's an intro class with no pre-reqs! Horrible, horrible teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	101	2	4	3	5	1189349	5/11/10	All in all a good teacher. He may not be passionate about teaching but he is passionate about what he is trying to teach. There was never once when I called him over, that he did not sit there and help me figure out what I had did wrong. His lab assistants can be a little cocky though. Openly talking down students lab report in front of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology	221	5	1	2	4	1189349	2/9/10	In the lab, he gives little to no assistance. He speaks down to his students for not knowing what he assumes is common sense. He speeds through class notes, and class never lasts the full two hours. I do not feel that I am my money's worth in this class. the class is easy, but try to get a different prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology	350	3	2	4	3	1189349	1/27/10	Well, what is there to say... He is a good guy, but he lacks teaching experience. You really need to ask him for help, not just mention that something is unclear. And what people say about labs is true - since he doesn't pay much attention to the process, I dont feel I learned much. The classes are fun, but sometimes just too much instead of work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology	350	4	1	1	4	1189349	12/14/09	One lazy professor. He hates his job and probably his life. The class is not hard but I feel like I am back in high school. Screams and embarrasses you for walking in late or taking out your phone with no warnings. No instructions about anything, he thinks everything is common sense.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology	350	5	2	3	4	1189349	10/22/09	Extremely lazy. Takes WEEKS to grade homework. NEVER responds to emails despite repeated attempts. Doesn't do anything but chat in labs; rarely helps. If asked, Harris just refers you to the labbies. Is not clear w/ instructions and doesn't explain anything (in lab). I'm paying for this...why??? Not boring though, fun, really easy class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	0	Information Technology	350	1	1	2	1	1189349	4/5/09	Weisman is incredibly lazy. He doesn't care if we learn and he doesn't help at all if you have a question. The TA grades everything slowly and if you submit something in the wrong format you get a zero. Points are taken off for right answers. DON'T TAKE HIM EVER
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology	221	4	2	3	5	1189349	12/20/08	Harris is an unconcerned teacher. He often leaves lab for maybe an hour and doesnt come back lol. He accepts only the format he wants and gives you a 0 for a simple slip.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	1189349	11/30/09	REALLY GREAT GUY and GREAT TEACHER. Was really funny and really helpful. The classes were easy and the work lots of fun. He made the class one of the best classes I have ever taken.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	2	Information Technology	306	5	5	4	4	1189349	10/9/09	One of the best NSSA professors. Comes straight out of the industry and is very knowledgeable. He will explain anything if you ask and his classes are super easy with only online tests. If you can take him DO IT!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology		4	1	5	1	1189349	2/2/09	His lectures are interesting, but he is a horrible lab teacher. He refuses to help if you ask him a question, and he doesn't even stay for his own lab class. Avoid him for lab at all cost.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Harris Weisman	3.4	1	Information Technology	221	2	2	3	5	1189349	11/3/08	Lazy Lab Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering		3	1	2	2	563853	2/25/13	This man is a horribly incompetent professor. He fails to understand some basic concepts of physical systems. He will talk for hours without saying anything. Does not understand that pvc pipe will not burst at 70psi. His lack of competence to complete a PHd is reflected in his lack of competence to teach and advise a 1 credit lab.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering	415	3	2	2	4	563853	5/20/10	He didn't seem to be capable of explaining the theory itself, so we just vaguely discussed practical applications. Most in class examples were example problems that already had detailed solutions in the book. Often covered the homework material two hours before it was due. Absolutely useless one-on-one.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering		5	5	5	4	563853	1/22/09	Very easy class. He lectures for the first half and then you and a partner complete a simple in-class assignment. If you get stuck, he helps. Pretty much a guaranteed easy A if you come to class. No tests. No HW. He is also good at explaining things and I learned how to use LabView fairly easily
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering		2	1	2	3	563853	3/6/07	He should teach Physical Education courses instead of Thermodynamics courses. He was not helpful with me. I had seen a hint of his rude behavior. He failed to explain CSH and VSH and the Mollier Chart. He was ineffective at using visual aids to address Thermodynamics solutions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	1	Engineering		5	4	2	4	563853	1/24/07	Freshmen Seminar was a complete disaster. He took a potentially useful class, and failed to teach anything. He enjoys hearing himself talk, and can waste time like no one else. I will give him credit for knowing about DAQ things, however, he is not good at teaching, or managing a classroom, or class procedures, and can waste time like no one else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering		3	5	5	5	563853	11/22/06	Great professor, very realistic when it comes to teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	563853	1/26/06	I like this guy, yeah he's a little boring, but he knows his stuff and the class itself is interesting. Seems like a nice guy though. You probably don't have a choice for him anyhow if this is for MIC lab, but he really is a nice guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering	280	4	5	4	4	563853	11/20/12	Had him for freshman engineering my first quarter. Not bad, but long winded so be warned. Knows what he's talking about and gives thorough explanations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering		5	1	3	2	563853	4/21/09	He talks and explains concepts at an unbearably slow pace and wastes time explaining things that should be obvious to anyone who has ever used a computer. Everything he teaches all quarter could easily be covered in two lectures if he moved at the same pace as most other professors. MIC is an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering	413	2	1	2	1	563853	2/27/08	Not a very good teacher. Asked if there were questions, then didn't answer any of them. Wasn't helpful at all. Class was boring and fairly useless. Tests were fairly difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	0	Engineering	413	1	1	1	5	563853	3/1/07	Absolutely terrible!!! Most of the time he doesn't teach and when he tries he screws up, "well I guess I have a lot of reviewing to do too," just before our big exam. He has a bad attitude and actually missed an entire concept that cost many of my class mates 50% on the first exam.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	563853	12/4/06	MIC is a fun class in my own opinion. It can get boring and I've taken naps in his class. There's NO graded work AT ALL, no final, no tests, nothing. You go there, he lectures for a bit, you do the assignment WITH A PARTNER (that isn't graded), then you can leave (usually you can leave in about 1 1/2 hours rather than the full 2.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	2	Engineering		3	4	4	4	563853	9/6/06	Seems like a good guy. Willing to help if needed, interesting if you make an effort.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Wellin	3.1	1	Engineering		4	2	3	3	563853	1/31/05	On the boring side, but he knows his stuff and he isn't difficult to get a decent grade in. Goto class though, skipping does hurt.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy Wells	1.0	0	Computer Science	820	5	1	1	1	871615	8/3/06	So easy, didn't learn much. The class was to read 1 online article and post about it and read 2 other students articles and respond to their post. No tests, quizes, papers; nothing. I thought grad school was supposed to be tough!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	1	Design		3	4	2	4	779353	1/28/11	To sum up Bruce in one word, I would say BORING. His lectures are boring and never ending, and the rest of class isn't much better. He is a pretty easy grader as long as you don't make something really stupid. He will help you if you show him your work before it's due (he doesn't say much during crits) and he also let's out class early A LOT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	2	Design		4	5	5	4	779353	3/4/10	Easy class. Nice teacher. He will help you if you need help and if you are way behind. Do the projects and you will get and A. He tries to be funny.. which is the funny part.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	2	Design	101	5	4	5	2	779353	7/16/08	Easiest guy you can get and still learn something. Yes, he's boring. And not exactly the most talented guy. But he's good for the freshman rastor/vector courses and is light on homework. Just be weird. He loves weird. Be weird, and you'll get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	1	Design		4	4	2	4	779353	11/9/07	Nice guy, but lectures are long and boring. Easy grader who likes students who participate in class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	2	Design		4	5	3	4	779353	2/8/07	Wenger is kind of boring but if you sit there and laugh at his lame jokes, he'll like you. The material was pretty easy overall and didn't require a huge amount of time. I liked the class very much.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	0	Design		3	2	2	2	779353	12/13/05	Bruce is very weird. His class is a little unclear and you never really know what he is talking about.Class Critiques are excrusatingly long and painful. But show up,act interested, and talk to him about class and you'll probably pass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	1	Design		5	2	4	3	779353	6/7/10	Did not learn very much in this class! Wish I had learned more photoshop because it is important for my major. Pretty sure some of my classmates could have taught better. The class sheets are self explanatory so you don't even need him to "teach." Projects are easy and wide open.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	2	Design		5	4	4	2	779353	2/5/09	He is nice guy who is always willing to help you out. He will stop class to catch you up if you are having a problem. Come to class, do the assignments, and it is pretty easy. He teaches the basics, so it is understandable if his class is a little boring.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	0	Design	101	1	1	1	1	779353	4/22/08	He's boring, a little pervy, but ridiculously easy. Then again, I had 16 credits of Computerized Graphic Design before I took him for Rastor and Vector.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	0	Design		5	2	2	3	779353	5/18/07	Rally easy, but also really boring. No, severly boring. Some of his assignments dont make sence, he has a hard time explaining them Weird guy. He reminds me of Tobias from Arrested Development.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bruce Wenger	3.1	1	Design		5	4	2	1	779353	2/8/06	He is so boring but stay awake and you will have no problem. He is the easiest 2DF teacher here not hard on attendence at all and no huge projects like some other teachers have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		3	5	5	4	1497906	3/4/13	Very enjoyable lectures, and is very helpful and nice. Go to office hours if needed very useful. It is hard, but do the homework and study regularly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		4	5	5	3	1497906	10/28/12	Dr. West is an awesome teacher. He is extremely helpful inside and outside of class. His lectures are very clear and his workshops are great at reinforcing the material. Weekly quizzes are done online, making them easy grades. I would recommend him to anyone who wants to learn physics and get a good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	0	Physics		1	2	2	5	1497906	4/23/12	Not a great teacher. Very quiet and hard to follow sometimes. He gives four assignments a week, one out of the book and three online but only one is mandatory. He also requires extensive lab reports to be typed and very formal, which is unecessary. Overall you will do a lot of work and teach yourself, almost everyone is doing poorly at the moment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics	312	2	5	5	5	1497906	11/18/11	"THE BEST" except hard exams! However, he's the best physics teacher I ever had. Very kind, very intelligent and very helpful!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics	311	4	5	4	5	1497906	9/5/11	He is very big on getting you as much help as possible; he is available on skype, email, and his office hours were very beneficial. His tests can be on the difficult side but he grades fairly. One of the best physics teachers at RIT. Highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		2	5	2	3	1497906	4/7/11	Definitely the best in the physics department. The problem is that the entire physics department sucks. He is really nice and puts a lot of effort into teaching. The problem is he often describes things way more complicated terms than they need to be in. However, I would still recommend him for any physics class at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		5	5	4	4	1497906	2/1/11	New to teaching but is very helpful and have amazing availability. Can sometimes spend too much time answering a single student's question and sometimes unorganized and missed some labs, but he gets through the topic and helps you understand the stuff. Not the best teacher at the moment but he's cool and I would recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		4	5	5	3	1497906	11/14/12	Fantastic lectures, extremely nice and helpful. Would recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		3	4	4	4	1497906	5/26/12	He gave very detailed notes (sometimes way to much derivation). His exams are on the difficult side and he does not curve them. He required extremely in depth lab reports, but they are not too hard. Overall great teacher for learning but do not expect an A. He doesn't round your grade, a 89.96 is still a B.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	1	Physics		3	3	3	2	1497906	11/28/11	He curves his tests, but they are extremely challenging! He also frequently goes on 'physics tangents' during some lectures and goes too fast. I did well in his class, but I wouldn't want to take him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics	311	2	5	5	3	1497906	10/8/11	Physics is extremely difficult for me, but I feel that if I hadn't of taken it with Eric, I would have failed outright. Works through all example problems in extreme detail, encourages questions, is available through Skype, lengthy office hours, and before and after class. Does a good job in explaining. Get to know him, too. He's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		2	5	4	4	1497906	7/4/11	Eric is a very intelligent professor who is keen to help students. He is available through Skype at almost all times and is very helpful. This being said, he is a challenging professor with high standards. On his first test (ever at RIT) he had to scale by about 20 points because his test was too long. He did respond well to feedback however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		4	5	4	4	1497906	2/4/11	not the best physics prof. but super helpful and give tons of extra credits. If u do not do well it's your own fault. If have problems and talk to him one on one, everything is super clear and he REALLY tries to make u understand everything. Plus he relies email quickly and is willing to answer any question.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Eric West	4.2	2	Physics		2	4	3	4	1497906	1/28/11	Pretty OK professor. Certainly one of the best in the Physics department(though that isn't saying much). I would recommend him to anyone taking the University Physics series of courses. Eric is willing to put in as much effort as you do, and is ALWAYS offering extra help on his own time though Skype and Email. He IS slow to hand back homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	2	Information Technology		4	5	4	5	736630	4/18/06	Great teacher! Out there at times, but knows his stuff and makes class fun. Grading is fair. Class is easy if you do the work. Wheeland Rawks! Take the class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	2	Information Technology		4	4	5	4	736630	2/26/06	Hes a pretty good teacher. Looks and dresses kinda nerdy but makes class a lot of fun. He know whats he talking abou and does a good job explaning it. I would take a class with him again
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	1	Information Technology	320	5	3	3	5	736630	11/6/05	Prof is Okay.... Kinda geeky i guess.... "board game fan".... yah... well it was a super easy class so yay! The projects are okay.. the first is a waste of time... but overall a good/fun class.... oh yah, i only saugh assistance once and he wasn't too cheerful about it.. meh...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	1	Information Technology		4	3	3	5	736630	3/3/06	he isnt a great teacher, his computer tests are open internet, so that was helpful. The projects take a whiole but as long as you have everything necessary (quality and looks arent very important) you do okay.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	2	Information Technology		4	3	4	5	736630	11/12/05	Wheeland is a cool guy. He grades a lil hard, but he tells you everything you did wrong. Should have been an easy class, but those damm study guides, ughhh!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andrew Wheeland	3.3	0	Information Technology		2	1	2	3	736630	10/25/05	Is a terrible teacher. Just talks and exspects you to understand. When you ask him a question he answers it in way that only IT people can understand. He is not nice and has no qualities that you coul say are good about him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Timothy  Whitcher	3.5	2	Computer Science	361	4	4	3	5	1768708	11/17/12	New professor, didn't know what he was doing at first but learned as he went just like we did. Lectures were a little boring but the project was the focus of the class. Messed up the final, but when push came to shove, gave me an A for all the work I put into this class. Difficult class, fair professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	0	Fine Arts		3	1	1	1	823998	4/3/13	In class right now. And all i can say is this guy is really nice, I'm sure if you sit down and had a drink with him he'd be a really swell fella... but this class...this class is horrid. I cant even explain it right now. Its just bad. NOT that it matters because this class is required, all i can say is ... May the Photo Gods smile upon you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	2	Fine Arts	306	5	5	5	2	823998	12/6/11	Kens a great guy. WEIRDEST sense of humor, its easy to miss. But his class is easy, he doesn't take attendance, and although he assigns book readings if you don't do them you can still manage a high B. Hes helpful and if you put a decent amount of effort in an easy A. You don't have to go to class but if you can you will have a great grade so go!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	2	Fine Arts	308	3	4	4	3	823998	2/23/09	Ken's a great guy, easy to talk to and very willing to work with you on any problems you might have. His lectures are easy to follow and keep you engaged so you don't fall asleep. He makes it very hard to fail his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	2	Fine Arts		5	4	5	4	823998	11/3/08	Very easy professor, and while the lectures can be dry and boring, it's still better than Western Art History. Attendance is required for quiz days only, but recommended - he will often repeat himself 4 or 5 times about a particular subject just to drill its significance into your brain. Recommended, though I don't think there's another option...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	2	Fine Arts	101	5	4	4	3	823998	1/9/12	ken is one of my favorite lectures, hands down.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	0	Fine Arts		2	1	1	2	823998	1/20/10	Worst Professor I have ever had. I am sitting in his class writing this because it is pretty much hell to sit here and listen to "um" and "ah".
Rochester Institute of Technology	Ken White	3.4	2	Fine Arts		4	4	4	4	823998	11/20/08	As long as you pay attention and attend classes, you should do well. He gives you all you need to know for the quizzes. His grading and exam exemption process is very very lenient.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Whitlock	4.7	2	Hospitality		4	5	5	5	113171	11/17/05	Very helpful prof. Lots of work but it is fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Whitlock	4.7	2	Hospitality		5	5	2	3	113171	5/17/05	Lots of projects and team work. Sometimes her information is not very clear but overall she will help you anyway she can. Definately would take her classes again.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Whitlock	4.7	2	Hospitality	101	3	5	4	4	113171	10/21/05	I had Dr. Whitlock for several classes. Wonderful person and great teacher. I would recommend her to any incoming student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Carol Whitlock	4.7	2	Hospitality		5	5	5	NULL	113171	5/6/04	Very good! Helpful just like Mom. You will learn so much, you just have to do your work so you dont fall behind. Def take her!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	804995	4/21/11	I love Keith! He's the best teacher here. You have to be willing to ask questions when you don't understand and pay attention to his lectures, but if you do that, you're pretty much guaranteed an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	330	4	4	5	5	804995	10/27/09	Great teacher all around. Lectures are clear and interesting and move at a flawless pace, out of class work is manageable, and exams are, well, a picnic.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	220	3	5	5	3	804995	4/28/09	Amazing Teacher. Couldn't have asked for a better programming teacher. If you are taking programming, make sure you get him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	219	4	5	5	3	804995	5/2/07	Great professor, 2006 - 07 teacher of the year at RIT, unique teaching style, gets the class involved doesn't just lecture. Helps students whenever he can, easy tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	804995	2/21/07	Amazing professor. Knows how to teach effectively, knows how to make you learn the material, and his extremely dry humor grows on you very fast. I'm usually a horrible programmer but I got nothing but As in his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	218	5	5	4	5	804995	8/10/06	The best programming teacher out there right now. If I could have him for every programming course I would be set for my whole college career. He does go out of his way to make sure you know what you are doing. If you do the ICEs you wont have trouble with the praticums.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	5	804995	5/26/06	Keith Whittington is a wonderful teach with a common sense unlike other half-assed professor at I.T department. He uses suitable teaching materials for students and it enables you to understand programming structure much, much more effectively.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	3	804995	5/2/06	good teacher, makes the class interesting with some weird but funny stories
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	2	804995	2/8/10	This professor is the man! He's the best professor at RIT hands down. This guy is not only a genius, he understands whatever level you are at and can explain things to you at your own understanding. He makes the classes easy and yet you still become a master by the end of the course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		3	5	5	5	804995	10/2/09	Great teacher. Funny, helpful. Only took programming 1 with him, but if you're taking it, take it with him. He moves at a lovely pace and covers the material quickly and thoroughly without being too fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	217	4	5	4	5	804995	11/24/08	If you've never programmed before, TAKE HIM. I had programming in high school, so I didn't learn much in this introductory course because it was review, but he definitely knows what he is talking about. I wish he was teaching 218. If you ever get stuck, send him an e-mail and he'll help you. Really.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		4	5	5	4	804995	5/1/07	This professor is one of the best. He even got an award for best professor. His teaching style is easy and he makes you learn the material. The homeworks are difficult but hardly count toward your grade. The tests are easy and count as a large amount of your grade. He is the best programming teacher available. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	3	804995	2/12/07	Amazing professor. Makes you learn easily. Keeps class interesting. I couldn't ask for a better programming teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		5	5	5	4	804995	7/11/06	He is one of the best teachers at RIT. He really goes out of his way to help students and is generally online. Don't forget to make it to the talent show where you will see him perform Queen! He's a great guy, and generally you won't be as bored as with other teachers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology	219	4	5	5	5	804995	5/19/06	Great professor. Excellent at explaining things. By 219 you know most of the professors use the standard power points (at least my 217 and 218 profs both did: he doesnt. Engaging lectures, good sense of humor, fair tests (no tricks). If you didnt catch the way he explained in lecture, hes great at calrifying and prompt with grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Keith Whittington	4.9	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	4	804995	1/27/06	I really like the way he teaches. Most of the in class stuff is done in parteners, and hes very helpful. If you have any questions he responds quickly to student help emails, and he is a fair teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		3	4	4	4	812895	5/20/10	She is extremely unfair. Deducts so many points for minor things. The way she assign teams is ridiculous, she ut all the leaders in one group and so-so students in other, not a good distribution!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication	101	5	4	5	4	812895	3/7/10	She is definitely the professor to take if you want your hard work to result in a good grade. She grades fairly and keeps the class interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication	352	2	5	5	3	812895	11/25/08	Great teacher. Made a point to get to know each student in the class. Really cared about the subject and that the students learn - and also are able to use it in real life situations. I'm really glad I took the course. It's not too hard if you already know how to write professionally.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication	101	4	4	5	2	812895	3/10/08	PROF COMM. Lots of work, but great teacher, will learn a lot in class. Will get a B at worst, but few students get an A. Great Prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication	352	3	4	4	2	812895	11/29/06	Very knowledgable. Lots of HW. I hope you like to write and are able to write properly. Very helpful with speeches, which are important in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		4	5	5	3	812895	3/1/06	Excellent course! Has you introduce yourself the first day so you become a family. Your writing skills WILL improve. Pay attention, and never take anything she has to say for granted; she knows what she is talking about. You will learn critical skills that will definately help you in any future career in business.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		2	5	5	4	812895	4/15/10	Awesome professor! She cares that the students learn and teaches you many formats needed in the business world. Class isn't an easy A, but do your work and you should be fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication	102	3	5	4	1	812895	5/11/09	She picks favorties so try to get on her good side. She counts hpw many times you are late and when u fall alseep . So stay up and pay attention. Recommand participate and skim text before class. Love giving surprise quizzes at beginning of the quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		2	4	5	4	812895	5/22/08	I took her for Prof Commm for Business. She is an excellent teacher who works hard at her job. A lot of busy work. You may learn a few things, but this class is mostly common sense. She makes it harder than it should be, but if you work hard you can get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		3	5	5	4	812895	2/15/07	Great professor! Professional Communication for Business is a class everyone should take with her. You will learn! And the class is fun. Always enjoyed going to this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	812895	11/14/06	Amazing professor. Truly cares that her students learn
Rochester Institute of Technology	Susan Widrick	4.7	2	Communication		3	5	5	1	812895	2/20/06	Very good teacher who knows how to teach. Never boring in the class. We learned everything regarding to business writing and presentation. Everyone should take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Glenn Wilkes	1.0	0	Science	232	4	1	1	1	882761	8/28/06	Did almost nothing for the (online) class. Terrible use of the courseware. Grades visible were wrong or reflected previous classes. Assignments were in teams, but with little guidance or oversight. Very disappointing (and I got an A, so not sour grapes here).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kevin Williams	3.5	2	Languages	316	3	5	2	3	1266729	11/18/09	good at feedback. However comes too late after most of homework is turned in preventing you from improving on grade. Could have made an A in the class had I been aware of problem areas before all homework was turned in.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry	216	3	4	4	4	633406	2/16/13	Dr. Williams is by far the most thorough Chemistry professor I've had. I never took chemistry in high school and he made it so much easier for me. Yes, he gives a lot of homework but I would rather know what I'm doing rather then "plug and chug". His tests aren't so bad if you really study. Take him, he will really make you understand chemistry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		5	4	5	4	633406	11/19/12	Great professor! He's very interested in his topic and is very focused when teaching. He answers any questions you have in class despite the class being in a lecture hall of over 100 people. The homework is a bit extensive sometimes, but it's worthwhile and not too hard. He's easy, smart, and helpful. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry	217	3	5	5	4	633406	10/26/12	Really nice guy and extremely helpful during office hours. He assigns a lot of hw and his tests are hard, but he gives out a study guide with similar questions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		5	5	5	5	633406	2/1/12	He's a great guy and very easy to understand. But he tends to over explain stuff for a really long time even if it is really simple to understand.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		3	5	5	5	633406	4/15/09	Great Professor. My favorite so far. I had him for M&P 1-2 and Media Law. If you follow along on do what he asks for you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		4	3	4	3	633406	2/4/08	go to class take notes on lecture n readings all quizes the midterm n final are all open note
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry	100	4	5	5	4	633406	10/30/07	Straightforward guy. ONe of my favorite professors.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry	215	3	4	5	4	633406	2/6/13	Excellent speaker. Lectures were very helpful. Assigns a lot of homework, but grades fairly. He knows his stuff, if you want to learn Chemistry, Dr. Williams is a good choice.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry	215	3	5	5	4	633406	11/13/12	One of the best professors I've had yet. Assigns a large amount of homework due once every week and a half, but the online system gives you several tries and hints with no penalty. Plan on learning a lot of the computational work outside class; in the lecture he focuses on theory, which he explains very well. He wants his students to succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	1	Chemistry		2	2	4	5	633406	2/8/12	nice guy. and good teacher im just horrible at chem. also assigns waaaaayy to much homework. very difficult if you dont do 15 questions a day. so make sure you dont leave it till sunday night
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		5	5	4	3	633406	11/20/11	Williams is an awesome professor, uses easy analogies to help you understand. Tests are straightforward and he tells you exactly what will be on them. Never tries to trick you. I know several people with over 95 averages. Definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		4	3	4	2	633406	11/19/08	no one really is interested in a research class at first, anyways. but before the end, my skills were good enough to get through the class decently with an A. definitely learned a good amount especially when you ask for review or assistance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	2	Chemistry		4	5	5	2	633406	2/3/08	Media Law was one of the best classes I've taken. Professor Williams made everything very clear and easy to understand. All tests were open note, including the midterm and the final. Read the book and take notes in class and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	0	Chemistry		3	1	3	1	633406	2/20/06	BORING BORING. Oh my god, you just try stay awake in his class. His tests are so easy though, you just memorize it from my courses.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	3	633406	10/30/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Williams	3.9	0	Chemistry		1	1	1	3	633406	6/16/05	Loser of a professor. Who obviously thinks that he can bully students around. Avoid him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	4	67420	7/19/12	Had him for multivariable calc. He was a great professor, tough on the students. HW was not mandatory, but doing the problems really helped, quizzes on the material every class. Exams were fair, but study was necessary.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics	305	3	5	5	4	67420	2/24/12	I really enjoyed this class. He is a tough teacher, but he answers questions when asked and he really knows what he's talking about. You can see his love for math when he's teaching. He does really hate phones and hats, but that isn't so bad. If you do the homework and ask questions if you don't get it, you'll do fine on the tests and quizes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	2	67420	1/23/12	He is absolutely one of the worst professors at RIT. Extremely unorganized. Quiz every day that everyone literally fails. The textbook doesn't help with his quizzes or exams. Don't take him if you are an 'A' math student and want to keep on that 'A' track. Had to withdraw for an easier teacher next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics	432	1	2	2	2	67420	1/18/12	worse professor for ever....don't wast your time with him....i am a math major, but i drop his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics	432	1	1	1	2	67420	9/28/11	he is really crazy pro..i ever had....never organize his notes...every day quiz..but you never know where is the quiz come from. I am a "A" student for math..but this class make me really sick...Don't take with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics		2	1	3	3	67420	2/3/11	This guy amused me at first, his lectures were entertaining, but as soon as I needed some help, he was very demeaning and rude. Plays favorites for sure, and if you are on his bad-list, even if you know the material, you will get graded harshly. Would not ever take a class with him again.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	67420	4/19/10	He is alright, I feel like alot of the homework material is not covered that will in class. Also I prefer to have formulas derived in front of me rather than just bluntly memorized, but no doubt he knows his stuff, and is approachable. I just wish he would teach what he preaches, understanding over memorization.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	2	67420	3/19/10	Mr. Wilson is quite entertaining as well as interesting. He will try to help whenever you ask. Unfortunately his quizzes are ridiculously hard and he doesn't curve at all. You will learn the material, but your grade will probably not reflect it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics	432	2	5	5	5	67420	10/23/09	First off, you CAN get an A in this class but YOU WILL WORK FOR IT. I and one other person got an A. He has no mercy for stupid mistakes, so DON'T MAKE THEM. Simple! That said, if you enjoy a challenge, Wilson is one of THE BEST professors I've ever had. GREAT lecturer and really pushes his students. You will learn A TON - if you can handle it. A++
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	4	67420	4/28/09	Wilson comes to class everyday enthusiastic about teaching us calc, and prepared to entertain us with birthdays and the history of math. You have a weekly quiz on everything you've ever learned and homework due every class. The workshops are hard but always relate to the real world. Very approachable- definitely one of my favorite professors at RIT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		1	3	5	4	67420	2/27/12	This guys awesome, older man who likes to be funny and his head is on straighter than mine and he's gotta be 80. He's a bit of a trickster though and he likes trolling his students. Do not try and suck up to him or else he'll call you out on it. Go to class, be chill, pay attention, smile, and you'll do fine. Auto +25% of points lost on exams/quiz
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics	305	1	2	1	2	67420	2/5/12	Doesn't know how to convey information. Talks to the class, no one understands, he moves on. On most occasions, he sees we don't understand, and he says that we look lost. And that he "sees it clearly." Good for you, dips**t, then draw a picture and show us what you see! I work ridiculously hard in that class, like 10 hours a week, easy. Skip him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	3	3	67420	1/19/12	Very knowledgeable and helpful.If you are a math major or you love math,then definitely take him at least once. However, not an easy A only with hard working, you have to be good at the subject in his class to get A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics	432	1	1	1	2	67420	10/12/11	He is a worst professor for ever. He always give you a quiz in class...those form not covered chapters. most student end up withdrawing his class. Don't wast your time with him....Really BAD TEACHER. Don't take with him...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	0	Mathematics		1	1	2	5	67420	4/20/11	Worst prof ever. I ended up withdrawing from the class. I went to my advisor and she said she cannot wait for him to retire because he gets some type of pleasure from failing the students. DO NOT TAKE!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics	531	3	5	5	4	67420	10/20/10	You either love or hate his teaching. If you want an easy ride, don't take him. If you want a to learn a lot but not be handed any grades, take him. He does grade harshly, but it makes you proofread your work and be more careful. If you don't like to work hard, find another professor. Dr. Wilson always has good stories to tell. No hats or hoods!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	1	Mathematics	283	1	3	3	2	67420	4/14/10	I had this teacher for Calc III and it was extremely difficult. There is a 2-4 page "quiz" every week. it often covered material that was not fully covered until after the quiz. Very strict about attendance, sleeping in class, and cell phones. Was a really smart guy, but a very harsh teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	1	Mathematics		1	1	4	3	67420	3/10/10	Great teacher really good lectures learned a lot from them. Absolutely horrible quizzes some of the material on them was not even covered in class no partial credit. When asked for help his responses were not even remotely useful office hours useless. Felt talked down to and in office hours his back was turned very demeaning.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	3	67420	5/7/09	He's the one of the most interesting/smart professors I've seen at RIT. I enjoy just talking with him. His class is VERY difficult though, and he is a harsh grader. You will not get the grade you hope for , but it's almost worth it just to hear him lecture. Very entertaining, and you'll learn a lot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	67420	4/27/09	At first I hated this teacher but after awhile he is pretty good. Not the best ever but pretty good at explaining and willing to help, although he seems intimidating. Not the teacher to get if looking for an easy A. His tests are mostly review of previous chapters, not what you just covered. Overall a decent teacher, just hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		4	5	5	5	67420	2/4/09	Damn if you can get this guy DO IT. This "Does anyone know who's birthday it is today?"
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	5	4	67420	4/24/07	Really smart professor. Didnt get an A but would recommend him to anyone. He somewhat challenges you, weekly quiz and hw. Has an amazing ability to make up jokes on the spot and knows a ton of bdays(or at least claims to know). Really really entertaining
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67420	2/28/06	had him for Calc II and III. The guy is amazing. I looked forward to class everyday. You may not get an A with him, but you will learn a lot. Probably the best professor I've had at RIT. He'll spend as much time as needed to make sure you understand the material. Oh, and he knows the birthdays of a lot of famous people. Very interesting!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics	282	2	4	3	3	67420	10/25/05	not my kind of teacher, gives you problems to see if you can master, not to see if you understand, does not grade on a curve, helpful if you ask, knows what he is talking about, derives everything, tons of class grades, weekly quiz,hw once or twice a week
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	67420	5/7/05	Very smart, usually helpful, not easy, but fair, and he's nice as well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics	242	3	4	4	NULL	67420	10/25/02	Awesome teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		1	4	4	3	67420	10/22/07	Awesome professor, one of the best I've had so far at RIT. He's very difficult, but an excellent teacher and even though you might not get the grade you want, the classes are enjoyable and you'll learn the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	4	67420	1/25/07	Isn't always 100% clear. Homeworks and labs were ridiculously hard, and he offered little help with either. Was available for help and questions during office hours. Amusing to listen to: "One day, you're going to end up **** and destitute, all because you couldn't remember the integral of secant x!" Overall grade: C+/B-
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67420	11/9/05	amazing teacher very smart and entertaining
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	1	Mathematics		3	2	3	4	67420	10/16/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Wilson	3.6	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	67420	1/30/05	Had him for calc I, II & III. He's a really nice and easy going guy. His test are fair and homework is assigned once a week (with some weeks having none.) You may not get an A from this guy, but you'll learn a lot and have some fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Winebrake	5.0	2	Science Technology & Society		2	5	5	4	901444	1/10/11	Great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Winebrake	5.0	2	Science Technology & Society	401	3	5	5	5	901444	5/12/07	Awesome professor, tons of real-world knowledge. Clear explanation, will do anything to help his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Winebrake	5.0	2	Science Technology & Society	402	5	5	5	5	901444	10/17/06	The best
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Winebrake	5.0	2	Science Technology & Society	700	2	5	5	3	901444	9/21/07	Awesome instructor! The best professor I've had by far!
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Winebrake	5.0	2	Science Technology & Society	402	4	5	5	5	901444	12/1/06	Great class by an all-star professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	0	Mathematics		2	2	2	1	1686718	2/26/13	Online hw was difficult and mostly irrelevant, and we were taught the "idea" of what we needed to know. Examples were almost non-existent which for an engineer is a very bad thing. He does provide sample exams so you know whats on the exams. Final was a juiced up and much more difficult version of the exams, it was bad. Wished for better grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	1	Mathematics	420	3	3	3	2	1686718	2/15/13	I had Dr. Whelan for Complex Variables and while he was a nice guy, I felt that his teaching needs improving. He focused entirely on theory while teaching a class full of engineers which is not always a bad thing but I was hoping for more applications. His tests weren't too hard and he allowed an equation sheet but his grading was a bit unfair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	1	Mathematics	361	5	3	3	4	1686718	2/29/12	Takes a long time to explain some things. Lectures are boring, not worth much. He is easy though, if you take the time to make a decent formula sheet you almost can't fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	1	Mathematics		5	3	2	2	1686718	2/25/13	Not a bad professor, just very boring. That may be my fault as an engineering student- I fall asleep when I see math notation. Helpful in providing practice exams, which can make you or break you by going over them. I suggest it, and you will get an A from doing so, easily.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	2	Mathematics	351	4	5	4	5	1686718	3/27/12	Great teacher! He grades pretty easy and wants to see his students succeed! He drops your lowest exam grade and replaces it with the grade from the corresponding section of the final, as well as a few other things to help improve your grades in his class! Take probability with him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Whelan	3.2	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	4	1686718	1/19/12	Best professor to take Probability with. I know people who had other professors who were struggling and had tons of work. Prof. Whelan gives us 4 problems for homework each week and a quiz with about 3 questions. For exams you are allowed a handwritten formula sheet, but you have to have a scientific calculator. He's great at teaching the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher White	4.2	2	Anthropology	406	4	5	5	5	1491162	2/28/13	Professor White is awesome and very helpful professor. He loves to talk a lot which sometimes I found annoying. But his lectures are great and he makes the class very interesting. He is a fair grader and his tests are pretty easy!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher White	4.2	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	3	1491162	1/30/12	Professor White is the best professor I have ever had. He was so nice, so engaging and made Anthropology an amazing subject to study. His tests are easy if you study well and pay attention, everything in them is from his lectures and he is NOT boring to listen to at all. Take him if you can, seriously, you will not be let down one bit!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher White	4.2	2	Anthropology	210	3	5	5	3	1491162	4/6/12	Convinced me to minor in anthropology after the 2nd class! An amazingly interesting professor that has the stories to back up the principles taught. A GREAT teacher to take for multiple classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Christopher White	4.2	0	Anthropology		2	2	2	2	1491162	4/5/11	Dr. White, was an okay teacher, and you watch interesting video's. However, his tests are complicated because their are two answers that are very similar.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	345	2	4	5	3	251460	2/13/13	A wickedly good lecturer. Fast paced but clear. Try to show up to every class; lots of material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	4	5	251460	12/1/12	OMG THIS GUY IS SO HOT.I love his loud voice. He is the best! Seriously, take him if you want your day to be brightened.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	1	Computer Science	243	3	3	2	3	251460	5/18/12	Not my favorite CS professor, but you could definitely do a lot worse. Lectures and problem-solving are very helpful, so go. White tends to get sidetracked, though, and a lot of the time what he was saying made no sense to me.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	345	2	4	3	5	251460	2/27/12	He certainly knows the subject, but is really bad at explaining his knowledge. He is fair, but a real hardass when it comes to grading (he frequently brags about this). He's very friendly and can explain nearly anything relating to the class, but be prepared for him to ramble for ~20-30 minutes when a simple 2 minute explanation would have worked.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	345	2	4	5	3	251460	7/7/11	An excellent lecturer but he doesn't like repeating himself nor does he do slides. He explains things excellently and is an expert on the subject, full of cool stories. However, his tests are hell, and so is the project (as bad if not worse than CS4). He tells you up front, it is rare for people to get As in his class. No curve. Prepare yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	1	Computer Science		3	2	3	5	251460	12/1/09	Found myself learning C++ from a website with tutorials rather than from the lectures. Labs helped out too. White did not seem to care how his students did and expected them to seek assistance outside of class. Lectures were very vague. Class consisted of three exams, weekly labs and a project with 4 submissions.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	2	251460	9/21/08	His CS1 class feels more like a class for those who have done some sort of programming in the past. NOT FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT! And the TA is not very helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	5	251460	10/30/07	Had him for procom, was a great guy but grades just as hard as he is awesome. You will not get an A. Period. I would advise staying away for procom, taking him for better CS classes, as procom with most other teachers is an easy A in a class that doesn't really matter. He teaches it very well, but gives a ton of work and grades that work very hard.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	231	4	5	4	4	251460	2/7/07	Very nice teacher and pretty funny. Goes off on tangents every once in a while which are really funny. Seems that he is one of the better if not the best Computer Science teachers, judging by opinions of other professors from friends. Java sucks!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	5	251460	5/10/06	Hilarious when dealing with attention mongers in class. Explains concepts well, though his notes are sloppy and he does not (at the moment) offer more comprehensi{v,bl}e course notes on the WWW. Make sure not to miss his class, and get there early so you can hear his rants.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	345	4	5	5	5	251460	2/13/13	Phil White does a phenomenal job of teaching this course; it may be my favorite in the CS program thus far. He's both knowledgeable and passionate about assembly language and computer architecture, and his lectures show it. They're concise, thorough, engaging, and downright impressive! Phil White is "the guy" for Computer Organization!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	1	Computer Science		3	3	3	3	251460	11/16/12	I am conflicted. I liked him up to the last 3-4 weeks of class. Then, everything went downhill. He tends to get sidetracked a LOT, so I feel the last few weeks of class were extremely rushed and unclear. I did well in class until the final which was Sanskrit to me, which made my grade suffer. He is an okay professor, but you can do better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	241	3	4	4	5	251460	2/28/12	Having been programming for years, Intro CS was fairly a review for the first few weeks. However, when we got into new material, such as trees, he was incredibly clear with his presentation and greatly enhanced my knowledge of the material. Never used the book, and I saved $50 by getting a PDF from a friend in advance. Attendance is mandatory.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	3	251460	11/12/11	HIS CS1 CLASS IS NOT FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT PROGRAMMING! YOU WILL BE LOST IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE PROGRAMMING BEFORE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	3	251460	10/20/10	HARD GRADER!!! If you dont already know java avoid at all costs!! got A's before him then i had to withdraw in CS3.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	3	5	251460	10/14/08	He's funny and a cool guy, but he's not an easy professor. He was always willing to help during office hours though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science	233	2	3	4	5	251460	5/20/08	The only reason i would recommend anyone should take this professor is for his lectures. They are very clear and easy to understand and his review of material is good also. However, his grading is horrible. He won't give you partial credit on assignments or projects and he tends to pride himself in giving some pretty hard tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	1	Computer Science		1	2	4	3	251460	5/23/07	I'll succinct here. Pros: fun guy, can teach material, not boring. Cons: HARD tests, HARD grader, disorganized, extra help not useful. So there you have it fun guy, but be ready for his challenging tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	251460	2/6/07	Amazing and fun. Had him for CS3, procom, CS1, and comp org. So far stands as my favorite teacher. He makes class funny and enjoyable to go to. If you ask a question he will go all out in making sure he answers it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	1	Computer Science		4	2	3	4	251460	2/27/06	Does not always flow and works off of other professors lecture notes, very insulting if you ask questions during office hours. He does know his stuff, however.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	4	251460	2/17/06	Very clear instructor. Knew what he was talking about. If you had a question, he did a very good job of explaining it, so you would understand. Wears star wars watches alot.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	3	4	4	251460	10/24/05	he's a cool guy. for my fist ever java class, it could have been better, but i survived. he assumes you've programed before, so that kind of sucked because some material went right over my head. but he's helpful and good at making class interest. get use to "foo."
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	5	5	5	251460	4/16/05	Very clear and didactic inside the classroom. Very helpfull outside of it. He's like a very knowledgeable kid. He teaches very well and doesn't mind to stop anywhere to take a chat. He LOVES calvin & hobbes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	5	4	251460	12/1/04	Presents material in a simple but effective format. Always entertaining, and managed to keep my attention even though I'd already taken the course in high school. Those who dislike the word 'foo' need not apply.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	5	251460	10/24/04	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		3	5	5	1	251460	11/3/05	Wonderful teacher. Very clear and organized teaching style, not hard to follow. Makes the concepts easy to understand. Always available outside the classroom, and will stop to chat if you see him on campus. Tests are challenging, but if you pay attention and study you'll do well. Definitely reccomend taking him if you have the option.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		5	4	5	5	251460	5/29/05	Very easy course, Phil White's an awesome teacher. Though his reviews are very limited, but you can always find him for extra help. I really enjoyed his teaching style.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	5	5	251460	1/15/05	Great guy to learn from... Granted, I knew most of the stuff coming into it, but still a fun class. Take this Prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		4	5	4	5	251460	10/25/04	Prof. White is very good, he teaches in a way that it makes what could be a very dry topic, somewhat interesting. He relates all the entry level programming idea's to real world things that help students understand. take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Phil White	4.0	2	Computer Science		2	5	5	3	251460	10/21/04	Such a fun guy. He's a very good lecturer. He goes off on tangents but they're almost always interesting and he always manages to get back on topic just in time. His explainations are very good and if they're not, just tell him and he'll go over it again. Wears t-shirts&sometimes doesn't wear shoes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephan Whittaker	2.2	1	Graphic Arts		2	2	3	1	852832	5/10/07	Teaches more or less on the side, primarily employeed at local printing company. As such, focuses on his area of the industry. Provided no information on other areas of Graphics. Required a checklist of good and bad things about the current class period. Questions would be reviewed for the first half of the following class and wasted too much time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Stephan Whittaker	2.2	0	Graphic Arts		3	2	2	1	852832	5/25/06	Class envolves lots of work, like reading 500 page books and writing 8 page outlines on them. Even if you get As on all papers, he scores very low on participation, which is 10% of your grade, and pulls your final grade down & he is unwilling to discuss it. Shouldn't be teaching-- repeats himself & class is too painfully boring to sit through
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	4	477834	3/5/13	Teaches mostly through examples. Doesn't go into as much detail and explanation of WHY but still gets material into your head. Homework not graded/collected but all quizzes come from homework problems. Encourages questions in class. Tests are a little difficult but are significantly curved.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	407	2	5	5	5	477834	5/17/12	While your homework and exams will be INSANELY difficult, if you just visit the man with questions, he has no problem walking you most of the way through them, and usually by the time you get that, you feel stupid for not getting the question yourself. The exams are based on homework problems. But, it's a great class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	477834	11/22/10	He is by far the worst professor ever at Math! He practically fails you, no partial credits, doesn't teach the material well, never gives example, and exams are impossible to pass (class average a 50) avoid him at all cost if you want to do well in multivariable or math in general
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	328	1	5	5	5	477834	10/20/10	hard professor, but why do you need the easy way out. Know his stuff . you will learn everything in and out. but expect his exams to be really hard, but there should be no reason why not to get 8/10 questions correctly last 20 points truly show if you understand the material
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	331	1	5	5	5	477834	2/19/10	I've only had him as a sub for two classes, and this guy already stimulates me. I wish I had him as an actual teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	4	477834	1/28/10	Clearly knows his material. It's difficult to read his hand writing so I'd suggest that you find a front seat. While he doesn't collect the homework, the quizzes are always straight off the homework. He goes over any homework problem students have even if it's on the quiz 20 minutes later! Test are mostly straight forward. Take him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	331	1	5	4	3	477834	10/28/09	Exams are extremely tough, but quizzes are fairly easy. If you unsure about something, ASK so that you don't fail the exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	477834	4/7/06	Best professor ever. Tests are hard but curves accordingly. Quizzes are straight forward, right off the homework. Very accessible at any time. Clearly explains every topic as many times as need be until it is understood. Take him if you get the chance. I have taken him for six classes, and it is the best experience in academica I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	477834	2/17/06	He is the god of mathematics, teaching, and everything inbetween.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	477834	10/24/05	Astonoshingly good teacher, I had him for calc 1, and he ws the best prof then. Keeps getting better every year. I am seriously thinking of being a math major purely because this guy is so damn good. There is a reason his classes fill up immediately, he is clear, helpful, and makes even the toughest of subjects a real ease.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	3	477834	2/21/13	Clear and pretty easy to follow. Homework assigned in the book is optional, I didn't even ever look at the book and I got a B. At the beginning of class he does problems from the homework on the board. The frequent quizzes are easy. Tests are hard, there are always a few ridiculous questions at the end. Luckily, he scales the tests significantly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		1	5	5	4	477834	11/28/10	This professor is extremely hard. Sure, you'll understand everything that he goes over in class, but his exams/tests are just ridiculous. The three out of ten challenging questions he gives on the test can be thought of as extra credit, however, since only a handful ever seems to get them right and the tests are curved with the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	1	Mathematics		1	4	2	2	477834	11/11/10	Very Hard. Tests are 10 questions. 7 are easy application, 3 are concept that he writes which are very hard. Quizzes on HW questions. HW not mandatory. Tests and quizzes are only grades so hard to come back if you screw up. He is forgiving if you improve a lot on the final though. Explains questions very well. Likes Mathematica
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	477834	10/17/10	He is perhaps the worst professor ever. His grading system is absolutely absurd and he gives you the hardest exam and pretty much every person fails the exam. It is a shame I actually failed his class because he simply can't teach and repeats the notes over and over with no examples
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	410	1	5	5	5	477834	2/18/10	A really great teacher. Take him if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	4	4	3	477834	11/10/09	He knows the material. Has a tendency to go really fast and his hand writing is difficult to read so don't fall behind. Homework is not graded but is based on quizzes. Exams are crazy hard but he does curve.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	411	2	5	5	5	477834	10/24/09	Dr. Wiandt is basically the Chuck Norris of mathematics. This course will make you feel like a moron at times but don't let that stress you out - the harder problems aren't tested on, they're just there to make you think. Class is a little fast paced, but see him in his office hours and you will walk out a smarter person. Definitely take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	477834	3/12/06	He flies through examples but will always, and I mean always, take the time to explain anything anybody has a question on. A few times he took half the class to go over the homework. Very approachable, excellent teacher. Take him if you can. For diff eq, tests are 10 questions; 7 strait forward, 3 challenging, but curves accordingly. Great teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	3	477834	10/25/05	Amazing prof. Cares about whether you understand or not and is accessible in and outside of class. Good notes and even though the tests are hard, you can still get a good grade if you do poorly on them. I only wish I could have him for all my math classes. Take his class! You'll be glad you did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	305	2	5	5	4	477834	10/23/05	I had him for calc I and Multi, only two calcs i got A's in, even though they were the hardest. He will challenge you, and no homework, just weekly quizes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	477834	10/18/05	Hands down the *best* teacher I've ever had. You WILL be challenged, and you WILL be disappointed in your test grades, but don't take it too seriously because he grades you on your ability to comprehend and use your knowledge, not how many canned problems you can solve. 30/48 on all the tests will get you an A. Any Qvestions you have? AHSSKK. OKIE?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	5	477834	5/3/05	Amazing teacher!!! As he says, "I will not insult your intellect with trivial problems." You will learn a lot in his class and you will be challanged. I walk away from this class knowing the material and very glad that i switched to a more challanging teacher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	4	477834	1/25/05	i felt he was a very good teacher, if you can understand what hes telling you. his accent is not that bad, but its not always clear. I thoroughly enjoyed his fast paced, and very structured teaching style. His tests however, were very, very hard, but he was a fair grader and made sure you understood
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	4	477834	10/24/04	Great guy. Good fun. And always willing to help. Little tough on the tests though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	4	477834	10/11/05	I've had Prof Wiandt for all my calc classes so far and cannot imagine taking from another Prof. He is very challenging, but will make sure you understand it. Tests are hard, as is the final, but at the end of the quarter there is a reasonable curve. Best professor I have ever encountered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics	281	2	5	5	3	477834	2/1/05	This guy seriously know his stuff. The first day I had him I thought that the accent would be the death of me. Fortunately I began to understand him, and the class was great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tamas Wiandt	4.5	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	2	477834	12/1/04	Nice, humble guy who pronounces Calculus as Calculoos. Other than that you should have no problem understanding him. He is always willing to help and his answers are always clear and to the point. As mentioned above, the tests are difficult, but grading is fairly generous. Gives lots of notes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Williams	5.0	2	Criminal Justice		3	5	5	3	1533952	9/6/11	Great professor, highly recommended. Tells interesting and fun stories that relate to in-class topics. Has lots of real-world experience and a clear passion for the subject matter. I'm hardly the best at attendance but I never missed one of his classes because I just didn't want to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Williams	5.0	2	Criminal Justice	400	4	5	5	3	1533952	1/24/11	Awesome teacher. Great personality, really knows his stuff. His lectures are actually fun to be apart of (for the most part). He shows DVD's that are actually meaningful to the class. His exams are not bad as long as you study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gina Wilson	5.0	2	Literature		4	5	5	1	576063	10/23/05	extremely nice and caring. will give your letters of recommendations if ever needed. truly loves her students and has a strong passion for what she does.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Gina Wilson	5.0	2	Literature		3	5	5	1	576063	3/3/05	Mrs. Wilson is a great teacher. She understands that her students have other committments, and work in other classes. She gives you enough assignments, but tries not to bog you down with them. She'll get on you if you try to half-ass work as well. Get on her good side and you're golden.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kaitlin Wilson-Bryant	5.0	2	Photojournalism	251	4	5	5	5	1312755	8/13/09	When I had Kaitlin, she was brand new. She's really enthusiastic, wants to teach you everything she possibly can and is always willing to see you outside of class. She assigns a lot of work! Everything from Photo projects to papers about photo articles. Other than that though, if you can take a class with her, do it!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Witz	2.0	0	Science	305	1	1	3	1	1174159	11/5/11	It was an online class which should have been easy but instead he graded our discussions on GRAMMAR and not what we were actually discussing! I went from an A to a C due to a misunderstanding on submitting a paper, wouldnt let me resubmit it even though he was still grading, and I got a C in a 4 credit class!! Do not take a class with this man!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Witz	2.0	0	Science	325	1	1	1	1	1174159	11/11/08	Terrible professor, arrogant. Demands textbook guidelines be followed exactly to the letter. Will not help students at all, or teach them unless it's to prove them wrong. Quizzes are often factually wrong and sloppily written. Avoid Mr. Witz at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Witz	2.0	0	Science	101	1	1	1	1	1174159	11/12/08	terrible, worst professor ive ever had, is no help and thinks hes the most perfect man in the world..dont ever take any of his classes!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Brian Witz	2.0	2	Science		2	4	4	2	1174159	9/1/08	Teaches adjunct at RIT and full-time at Nazareth. Tough professor. Didn't answer students' questions. His grading is subjective. Avoid him if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	420	3	5	5	5	955275	4/6/12	One of the BEST teachers at RIT! Extremely knowledgable of the field and knows how to convey it to students at all levels. He will help you with any question and really makes things easy to understand when the material is not. A great guy to befriend as well!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	225	5	5	5	4	955275	3/23/10	Great Professor. Class is easy, no homework if you stay to finish in class. Wolcott will help with anything. Great guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	225	5	5	5	2	955275	2/8/09	He is a great guy, knows his stuff and is funny. He'll be a friend outside the classroom if you make the effort. I know the class sucks, but everyone has gotta take it. CAST RULES
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	420	4	5	5	4	955275	11/5/10	Best teacher CET department has. He is a great teacher and you will learn alot. Grades very fair and homework is straight forward. I highly reccommend this teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	420	3	5	5	5	955275	1/26/10	Great Guy! He will bend over backwards to help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Scott Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	101	5	5	5	5	955275	2/2/07	Awesome guy, explains everything clearly, and is hilarious in and outside of class!!! Explains WORD, EXCEL, and POWERPOINT perfectly!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		2	2	2	2	1042606	2/22/12	Probably the worst Professor I've ever had. Doesn't use MyCourses, illegible handwriting, low talker, tests cover a wide range of topics which are hard to study for. This guy needs to retire.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		2	1	1	3	1042606	4/19/11	Handwriting illegible. You have to sit in the front row to hear him. Does not answer questions well. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	4	1042606	1/10/11	Handwriting is indeed illegible. Simply clicks through slides without really explaining them. If you don't already know everything about computer networks then you will most likely spend the quarter doing TONS of independent learning outside of class and still end up failing. AVOID!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science	713	3	1	2	4	1042606	5/9/10	One of the worst professor. His teaching skill is v.poor.Don't expect to attain something with him except boring and sleeping.His grading is mystery. If you have extra money and time ,you can lose them with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	3	1042606	10/24/08	Pretty much impossible to understand. Doesn't know what the class is doing while he's teaching. Expect to try and figure everything out on your own. Acts as if the entire class knows what he's talking about, so if you don't you're screwed. Bring a pillow.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science	420	1	1	1	2	1042606	7/7/11	His homework is all hazy theory questions. He made us write one program: strip all but four header lines from a text document formatted as an email. 2 lines of python. Lectures suck, handwriting sucks, brutal tests, graded unfairly and pedantically, I ended up not going and now I have an incomplete I'm struggling with. Oh and he's probably 104.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science	420	1	1	1	3	1042606	1/30/11	Handwriting is completely illegible, mostly reads from a slide show. Speaks too softly to be understood. You have to teach yourself to pass. Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	1042606	5/20/10	Don't ever think about taking this professor. AVOID AT ANY COST. He doesn't curve and he doesn't explain things well. his handwriting is not understandable at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science	420	2	2	1	3	1042606	11/15/08	His homework assignments and tests are very ambiguous. He also grades your homework ambiguously. And his lectures are not clear at all. He merely read off slides from the book. Not recommended at all.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Walter Wolf	1.2	0	Computer Science		3	2	1	5	1042606	10/24/07	Poor teaching skills, messy handwriting, repetitive and often irrelevant notes, mixes up Java and Fortran occasionally. He knows his stuff, but I'd avoid him unless you've already taken a CS class before.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	4	1435804	2/8/13	Great teacher. Taught me everything I needed to know about how to see a form in 3D space. He's really nice and really funny. A stickler for rules and deadlines, but not too harsh. He gives a pretty heavy workload. Overall, best professor I currently have.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	1	1435804	5/6/11	Nice guy, low key. So far I have enjoyed this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	2	1435804	5/6/11	Low key, nice guy. Knows his stuff.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	0	Fine Arts		3	1	2	1	1435804	5/19/10	horrible experience to have him as a teacher after having an exceptional teacher for the first 2 quarters.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts	243	3	4	4	4	1435804	6/2/11	I had Wolff for 3d design (I, II and III). He was a nice teacher and likes students who show interest and work hard. He grades fair: gives you the grade you deserve. Friendly and willing to help and give you advice/ suggestions for improving your work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts		3	4	4	1	1435804	5/6/11	Nice guy, low key but knows his stuff. I enjoyed the projects.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bill Wolff	3.8	2	Fine Arts	303	3	5	3	4	1435804	6/30/10	Quiet guy. Doesn't keep class under control. Show interest, be polite to him, and he'll like you. Very willing to help his students that show interests, and knows his material WELL. Getting used to teaching intro to 3D, so gonna be rough. Overall, enjoyable guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jen Wolfly	3.2	2	English	100	5	5	4	4	1040816	10/25/11	Nicest, most inspirational women I've ever met. Class taught me much more than what it was intended to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jen Wolfly	3.2	0	English	104	4	2	2	4	1040816	10/23/10	The professor likes to get off topic through a majority of her class. If you are looking to have an actual lecture i would look somewhere else. The professor was tedious to contact through e-mail and most emails had horrible spelling which made understanding her difficult. I would not recommend her unless you just want an easy grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel  Wood	4.5	2	Engineering		4	4	4	2	1794106	2/1/13	He's a very good professor. Has experience from industry and knows how to explain things very well. He's very helpful so if you don't understand something raise your hand and he will help you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Daniel  Wood	4.5	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	1794106	1/23/13	Took a solid modeling class with him. He was very helpful -- he answered everyone's questions and made sure everyone was on the same page. Don't hesitate to tell him to slow down in class, he will repeat stuff for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Wood	4.9	2	Accounting		5	5	4	3	1577612	5/22/11	Great prof! easiest class for RIT business majors
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Wood	4.9	2	Accounting		5	5	5	1	1577612	5/16/11	Awesome guy, good teacher, makes this class a breeze
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Wood	4.9	2	Accounting		5	5	5	1	1577612	5/17/11	Professor Wood is amazing! I was worried about taking this class but he made it so relaxing easy and fun. He is a very kind and understanding person. Gives you all the opportunities to earn the grade you want. I'm very lucky I took his class. Wish I took Fin Acc with him too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Thomas Wood	4.9	2	Accounting		5	5	5	5	1577612	5/10/11	one word: amazing!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracey Worrell	4.4	2	Communication	535	5	4	4	4	1189311	11/12/10	This is a GREAT professor! Attendance is mandatory for in class assignments which are easy. The paper is very short and doable and is also fun to write up. Participation is a given as well as the presentation. Exams are pretty tough but if you read the book you should be fine. She is a very fair grader and i would take her course again for sure!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracey Worrell	4.4	2	Communication	445	5	4	4	2	1189311	11/18/09	Had her for Theories of Comm. Class was quite easy, you don't have to do any of the readings as long as you show up to class. Gives out in class assignments so attendance is mandatory if you want a good grade. Three required papers, easy midterm and so-so final. I would recommend her as a professor but not this class as I disliked the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracey Worrell	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	5	5	1189311	10/21/08	She's very intelligent, but at the same time-she's hilarious. Will keep you interested. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracey Worrell	4.4	2	Communication	101	2	5	4	5	1189311	2/17/10	One of the best teachers I've had. She can be a tough grader but try your best and you'll do fine. Aside from being a fun and interesting person, she let me redo a paper i didn't do well on after not fully understanding the assignment. I love Tracey, wonderful teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tracey Worrell	4.4	2	Communication		3	5	4	4	1189311	11/9/08	Really funny and tries to engage the class. Shows videos that relate to the material but are entertaining. A bit of a harsh grader on papers though, but no one failed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Wu	3.4	2	Engineering	420	4	5	4	4	784830	12/1/06	Wu is a very good professor. There are times where it is difficult to understand him, but he tries very hard to make sure you understand and is very helpful out of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Wu	3.4	0	Engineering		4	1	1	5	784830	7/26/06	Lei is the worst professor in the SE dept. I've ever had. He "advised" our project since he claimed to know the technical aspects of it, yet he couldn't answer simple questions. By other means that I won't go into, he almost ruined our project. Fortunately our team was able to run itself, since he was certainly a hindrance rather than any help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Wu	3.4	2	Engineering	361	3	5	5	5	784830	12/19/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Wu	3.4	0	Engineering		2	1	2	4	784830	7/28/06	Not a good advisor. Incompetant. He was more interested in kissing the sponsor's butt than in listening to his team. He grades solely on what the sponsor says and takes nothing else into account. He doesn't look at effort or anything else. Oh yeah and at the beginning of the project and all the way through he told us we were going to fail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Lei Wu	3.4	2	Engineering	361	5	5	5	5	784830	12/19/05	A wonderful guy and is very helpful out of class. If you didn't perform well in Quiz, he will discuss with you and see your improvements later. He is very willing to help and always available.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cori Winrock	4.3	2	English		5	5	5	5	1494764	7/8/11	It was five week course and it requires a lot of reading and writing. However, she is really helpful and she grade fairly easily. Class is mainly discussion base so if you don't read, you are not going to get good grade.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cori Winrock	4.3	2	English		4	4	3	4	1494764	11/12/10	Not a bad professor, demands a little too much for a liberal arts requirement. Overall look for an easier professor if you can. Her discussions are forced and pointless, be prepared to spew garbage for participation points.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Cori Winrock	4.3	2	English		2	5	4	3	1494764	1/28/11	Overall she is a really good teacher. Very nice and polite. She is willing to help you.I found her to be a good teacher and I learned a few things. 8am writing seminars are horrible. Her discussions were forced but oh well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fred Woelk	1.6	0	Computer Science		3	1	1	3	1495257	1/29/13	Had Ben "Fred" Woelk for Cyber Self Defense. The class was a joke. He tried to integrate Twitter which was a DISASTER. He openly acknowledged with the class that the slides were outdated, and he did nothing about it. Avoid him for this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fred Woelk	1.6	0	Computer Science		4	1	2	5	1495257	11/27/11	I honestly don't think he knows what he's talking about. He didn't demonstrate his knowledge of anything - he just read of PowerPoint slides. If you don't know anything about technology he might be interesting or bore you to death depending on your learning style. Easy A, but he doesn't seem very motivated.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fred Woelk	1.6	0	Computer Science		3	1	2	5	1495257	9/13/12	He is a terrible teacher. He literally has no knowledge about Cyber Self Defense except for what his pre-made slides say. I would recommend looking for a different teacher if I could.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Fred Woelk	1.6	1	Computer Science	220	2	2	3	1	1495257	11/13/10	This guy is absolutely horrible for cyber self defense. He does not want to teach the class at all and as a result is very sarcastic, grades harshly, and uses premade assignments instead of making his own. I would avoid his class at all costs and take it with someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	320	4	5	5	5	1278497	11/18/12	She is the best civil engineering teacher at RIT. she knows her stuff, she explains very well, and also there to help you out. 11/10
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	400	4	5	5	5	1278497	1/26/10	Great prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	320	5	5	5	4	1278497	11/25/10	Great professor. Very understanding and kind. She always willing to help students with anything. She made surveying 1 interesting and easy to learn.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Teresa Wolcott	5.0	2	Engineering	340	3	5	5	3	1278497	4/28/09	she's really cool, funny and knows her stuff. if you get the chance take a surveying class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfe	3.0	2	Graphic Arts		1	5	4	4	1403976	1/31/11	Great professor.. very demanding though. She will transform your book and help you find youreslf as a designer. Very supportive of "risk takers"... gives you lots of freedom if you give a sh*t about the work. If you're lazy, you won't have a good experience though. She can be critical, but in good way.. she is honest and teaches you to THINK!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfe	3.0	0	Graphic Arts		2	1	2	5	1403976	1/30/10	This professor is highly unprofessional and downright rude to students. I learned very little from her portfolio design class because her comments (when given) are strictly critical rather than constructive. I would NOT recommend this professor. One of the worst I have had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	504	4	5	5	5	468378	1/20/13	This is a late rating as I took her class Spring Quarter of 2012, but one word to describe her. AMAZING. Total and complete clarity, not to mention hilarious. She's one of those professors that makes you look forward to attending the class. By far my favorite teacher in RIT. You can tell she genuinely cares about each of us.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	0	English	110	5	1	1	4	468378	5/23/12	If you like to hear off topic discussions about topics unrelated to CJ take her. I went into the class wanting to learn a lot, ended up not learning a thing that I did not already know.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	405	5	5	5	5	468378	4/30/12	Undoubtedly the best professor I have had at RIT! I've taken 2 classes with her, and I'm taking a 3rd one in the Fall. She really doesn't ask too much of you - just read the material and participate and you'll do just fine. Discussions are interesting. Definitely recommend! You need to take at least one class with her while at RIT!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	1	English		4	3	3	1	468378	4/17/12	Jen is hilarious. Her classes are interesting to say the least. However, if you are looking for a blow-off class, Prostitution and Vice is not it. Class discussion is a big part of the grade but there is still quite a bit of writing involved. Textbook is also required, although you may find one of them at the library.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	4	5	5	468378	3/4/12	She will call your name for participate if you don't say any words in class. Being participate in class will give you a good grades because she loves to hear your opinions. She won't bite you. Do your papers and show up all classes, you'll receive an A in an easy way
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	327	5	5	4	5	468378	3/2/12	Professor Jen is the sweetest, nicest, and most hilarious professor I've ever had the pleasure of taking a class with. Her essay assignments are a little vague, but she's an easy grader and ultimately values class discussion more. Lots of fun, take a class with her if you can!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	405	5	5	5	5	468378	3/1/12	By far the best and most engaging teacher I have ever had. She is a professor that actually cares about the student and the substance of what we take from the classroom. She is simply DA BEST.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	327	3	5	5	5	468378	2/23/12	Took Literature of Crime Arts of Expression Honors Class. Absolutely AWESOME!! Take it if you get the chance, she's a great professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	5	468378	1/27/12	I have taken quite a few classes with Professor Wolfley as a CJ major. Her classes are never, ever boring and she makes sure that each student takes something away from her class. She has the real-world experiences to back up just about every topic, and these stories never fail to entertain. If you get a chance to take her class, TAKE IT
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	5	468378	11/22/11	Best teacher at RIT. Take a class with her and you won't regret it! She's hilarious and she finds a way to make tough situations easier to learn about.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	5	468378	6/7/12	Best teacher I've had at RIT. Jenn is hilarious, always keeping class interesting. I've had two classes with her and got an A in both. Subjects are interesting and I learned a good deal. Highly recommend!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	4	468378	5/18/12	Had her for Domestic Violence, she was a great teacher in a class where the subject matter can be difficult to hear. She does a great job at making everyone feel comfortable and learn. Would highly recommend taking any classes with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	4	4	468378	4/29/12	Jennifer is an awesome professor. She genuinely cares about her students & tries to make class as fun as possible although we have to discuss dark subjects at times. She does want everybody to participate in discussions & your grade will reflect how much you have participated! Definitely worth taking! :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	3	468378	3/11/12	She was an awesome professor who always tried to keep class positive despite the dark subject. She was always helpful and the assignments were easy if you did the work and went to class. It was important to get involved in discussion and push the discussion along. Great class and professor I highly recommend any of her classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	5	468378	3/4/12	I have take every class Jen Wolfley has taught at RIT.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	5	468378	3/1/12	This is the 2nd class I've take with Professor Jen & it was great! The material is different than any other criminal justice class I've taken & she gives interesting & realistic perspective on the corrections system, focusing on inmates. The class is easy if you're engaged- don't skip out, she has a LOT of great things to say & stories to tell!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	327	5	5	4	4	468378	2/27/12	Professor Wolfley was an awesome teacher. Totally not what I expected from a Lit Prof. She is engaging, entertaining, and very passionate and knowledgeable. Highly recommend taking a class from her
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		3	5	5	5	468378	2/3/12	Jennifer Wolfley is AMAZING. After getting to know her on a personal and professional level, believe me -you will learn a lot in her class. The homework is fair and she gives us time to think about the subject matter. Wolfley makes sure everyone is comfortable in the classroom and listens to everyone. I STRONGLY recommend you to take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	319	5	5	5	4	468378	1/25/12	Best teacher ever!! She is funny and easy going. To get a good grade do the work and show up to class. The papers she gives aren't long and the quality of learning is exceptional. If you don't get what she's talking about then just ask and she'll break it down for you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	3	468378	11/20/11	One of my favorite teachers ever, lots of fun, not a lot of work, and class is always interesting, she loves to her what you have to say and isnt afraid to voice her opinion as well
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	4	5	3	468378	11/20/11	One of the best professors at RIT, hands down. I took a class with her because a friend of mine recommended her, even though I had no interest in the class at first. It turned out to be one of the best classes I've taken. Homework is minimal, but make sure to actually do it. She's extremely funny and knows a lot about her field. Take her if you can
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	3	468378	11/18/11	This woman is amazing! She had me laughing so hard I was in tears a couple times. Not only is she funny, she is very interesting and knowledgeable. I didn't think this class would benefit me at all, but I actually learned a lot. If you hand in your work you'll get an A. Do whatever it takes to get in a class with her.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	1	468378	11/9/11	Take her!!! Shes absolutely hilarious, so nice, and very understanding. If you participate in class discussions she'll automatically love you. We wrote two papers on something that interested us. Our class topic for the quarter was love, sex, and intimacy. What could be better? Take her!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	3	468378	11/9/11	Prof Wolfley is amazing. The class topics are relatable and interesting.

Take HER!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	405	4	5	4	3	468378	10/24/11	One word describes this professor: intriguing. Prof. Wolfley has gone through a lot in life and brings an amazing amount of insight and experience to the classroom. She cares about the subjects she teaches, her students, and their success. The best professors are those who KNOW their subject area and know it well, and she definitely does. :-)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	4	4	468378	9/26/11	Lots of fun. Takes an interest in her students. Never a dull moment. Even her class is offered at 8am, you will go just to be amused. I'm totally taking more of her classes just for kicks.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	4	4	4	468378	4/28/11	Pretty easy class. You only have to write a few short essay for the whole quarter. No final. Very little reading to do. Some of the lectures can be a bit boring, but others can be amazing. She is very sweet and tries to keep the class as interesting as possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	314	5	5	5	4	468378	8/12/10	Very good professor. I think everyone should take a class with her. She is very blunt and to the point and has a very good sense of humor about it. Very lenient and fun professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	2	468378	11/24/09	Best teacher ever. She is a very fair grader. There were only three three-page papers we had to write, one eight page research paper, and a few journal entries instead of a final. Tells hilarious stories from her own life and I always looked forward to her classes. We read a book and watched three movies that really covered the topic of the class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	502	4	4	4	3	468378	2/3/09	I had "Professor Jenn" as she calls herself my first semester of freshman year. I saw writing seminar & was totally bummed out. I had no interest in taking it at all. However Professor Jenn told hilarious stories every class & always kept me interested. I had a great experience & the papers were easy. She's an amazing professor! Lots of fun.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	504	5	5	5	5	468378	11/19/11	Best teacher I have ever had! Incredibly interesting class and she is so interesting!! Take her for everything/anything you can! I took her for my Arts of Expression class and one of my favorite classes I have ever taken, and I'm not even a Criminal Justice major. She's hilarious and knows what she's talking about. Also, homework is minimal/easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	5	468378	11/10/11	The best professor I have EVER had
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	101	5	5	5	5	468378	11/9/11	I couldn't have asked for a better writing seminar teacher. It's worth waiting until sophomore year to take it with her. Seriously. You won't regret it. Prof. Jen is hilarious, the class discussions are interesting and you will laugh your ass off more than once. Take her. Seriously.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	227	5	5	5	3	468378	10/25/11	Although I have never really enjoyed writing,this class was great. Professor Jen was very helpful and made the class interesting and enjoyable. I would highly recommend taking her class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	501	3	5	5	5	468378	5/17/10	This is by far the best teacher i have ever had. She loves to teach. She focuses not on bombarding people with work, but rather making sure we can understand the content and take something away from the class and use in the real world. Long story short if you have a chance to be in any of her classes you'll be glad you did.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	217	5	5	5	5	468378	2/9/09	Writing Seminar doesn't get much better than with Professor Jenn. Shes amazing. Essays are fair and require alot of thought, but she isnt a tough grader and lets you work for a grade booster. Her stories from real life are amazing and tie into all the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	4	468378	5/12/08	This was a new course under Criminal Justice and it was fantastic. She co-taught the course, but she had a deep interest in students and helping them to understand the subject. Very very easy course, take home midterm/final... but the course is mostly free form and open to all discussion. Very informal and fun, she's a blast!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English	101	5	5	5	5	468378	8/15/07	The best teacher RIT has to offer!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	4	5	1	468378	3/2/07	Easy enough A if you do what she tells you to. A lot of her stories are really funny and leave you wondering if she really just said that but others are just flat out disturbing you might learn stuff in this class, but not really how to write. If you cant do that by now then go home, otherwise you might want to take this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	4	468378	2/2/06	awesome class. Shes really entertaining. watch a lot of movies, and write about them.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		2	5	5	5	468378	7/29/05	I absolutly love Jennifer Wolfley. In all honesty if you do not get to take a class with her you should just drop out now, because there is no other reason to go to this school. Jen is THE best. she honestly cares about you, seriously I was thinking about transfering and she would talk to me everyday about going to check out colleges together.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		5	5	5	5	468378	4/16/05	She's got a story for every situation. Don't get me wrong, she's no comedian. SHE CAN TEACH her stuff. Classes end early, workload is challenging. Definitely one of the best teachers ever. Too bad they might be removing Writing & Lit from new curriculum...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	2	English		4	5	5	4	468378	2/1/05	omg she is by far the most fun professor that i've had at RIT! Hilarious and makes every class something to look forward to. Her grading is kinda challenging but it isnt hard to get an A if you put in the effort. I am definitely taking her in w&l 2. No final, loves letting us out early. Amazing!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jennifer Wolfley	4.7	0	English		4	2	1	2	468378	10/5/04	She is one of those teachers who tells you at the beginning that she is interested in what YOU think, not what SHE thinks, and then makes the opposite entirely obvious. She likes to hear herself talk and doesn't have much of use to say.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	2	Finance	721	3	5	5	5	368606	11/17/11	Professor Wollan's lectures are extremely well presented. She is inspiring and genuinely concerned about her students. Highly recommended. She now teaches at St. John Fisher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	2	Finance	520	3	5	4	4	368606	3/29/11	Currently taking her class for intro to options & futures. Shows clear examples of the topics covered. Quizzes are once a week and most of the questions a similar to the hw (not recquired) but is neccessary to do well on the quizzes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	0	Finance		1	1	1	3	368606	1/21/08	Tests are nothing like review sheets that are passed out prior to exams. Makes class way more difficult that it needs to be. Looking at the book for five minutes is more helpful than listening to an entire 3 hour lecture.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	2	Finance	520	3	4	4	4	368606	5/18/11	Apparently according to the previous comments she's only good at teaching Intro to Options and Futures. I do know that she's a great professor in that class. She gives clear examples, is helpful and the tests are not difficult as long as you drive the problems and concepts into your brain.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	2	Finance	520	2	5	4	5	368606	9/26/08	Took one of the most important classes of my life with her. Options & futures is truly a class that you will need later in life. She is the only prof. that teaches it and is more than capable of doing so. I thought the lectures were exciting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Patricia Wollan	3.0	0	Finance		1	1	1	1	368606	10/23/05	I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S STILL EMPLOYED AT RIT. ROFL-copter!!!

Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	0	Science		1	2	1	3	67480	10/31/06	class average around 30/100 and imposible to follow. talks more about fishing than the material. relighs on stick figures, and not helpful to studants with diabuilities. avoid at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science		4	3	4	3	67480	12/1/04	Excellent choice for those who enjoy stories about the good ol' days and/or marijuana references. Presents things fairly well, but if you're trying to take thorough notes you may find him a bit to fast.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science		5	5	5	NULL	67480	5/27/04	Much better than Turner for organic chem. Doesn't like it when people don't bother to try and learn the material. Actually gets pretty pissed about it. Will be fine if you actually try.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	1	Science		4	3	3	NULL	67480	11/21/03	Pretty funny guy, but he's not very clear. You'll spend lots of time studying on your own, and you'll hear "It's that easy" from him often.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science		4	3	4	NULL	67480	5/26/03	Has a great sense of humour. Manages to be clear even in a big class of 150 students. Exams are easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science		3	4	4	NULL	67480	12/3/02	he's not a bad guy. tries to make things fun
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science	208	4	4	3	3	67480	10/25/05	very helpful, grades on curve, uses owl but not really counted towards grade, can go alittle fast, very interesting man, my favorite teacher this qaurter. (freshmen fall)
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	2	Science		3	4	5	2	67480	10/2/04	Awesome guy. Made the class very interesting. Has a very unique and successful way of teaching. You learn the material, regardless of how you do on the exams. Which, if he makes them, are difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	James Worman	3.0	1	Science		3	2	3	NULL	67480	5/4/04	If it wasnt for the curve I wouldve failed this class badly but managed with a B. He's not that helpful, doesnt really encourage questions, and goes pretty fast. Likes fishing a lot and will tell many stories about it.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	0	Biology		1	1	1	1	1067777	2/20/13	STAY CLEAR!!! Sporadic teaching. Tries to help but cannot explain simple concepts. No answer keys posted for any tests. Final is cumulative but unless you ask about ever single question there is no way to know what you had right or wrong. Overall one of my WORST experiences at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	0	Biology	311	1	2	2	2	1067777	1/22/13	I took her for cell biology, hated the class. She is kind of all over the place with her notes, and worksheets, her test are absolutely the hardest test ive ever taken, ive studied the notes, book and had a tutor it still doesnt work. the book sucks and doesnt help any. I wouldnt take this class again.... her test are impossible!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		2	4	5	3	1067777	10/19/11	her test is pretty difficult. just study hard and pay attention to class. and yes I think you should take Perry for Cell Biology. I hear lot about Perry and they say lot of positive things about Perry
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		2	4	3	3	1067777	2/8/11	Difficult to understand at times and lectures are both quick and somewhat random. Helpful if you go and ask for help but it takes a lot of focus and studying to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	0	Biology		2	2	2	4	1067777	11/1/10	Dr. Wright is a terrible teacher. She just talks and talks and doesn't allow time to process and understand what is going on. 50% of her class is "FYI" and then she says "this is for your general information, but you won't need to know it for a test".... THEN WHY ARE YOU TELLING US IT?! I thought the class was very unorganized and scattered.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		1	5	5	3	1067777	2/24/10	This is the person to take it with if you want to learn about cell biology. She knows her stuff, she is a little challenging but she is really passionate and will help. You can get an A on tests and its all multiple choice. Pay attention and study hard. Plus she's not that bad looking :). 89.5 = A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		1	4	4	3	1067777	11/14/09	Not a bad professor, but her exams are too hard and it sucks because most of the grades come from the exams.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	0	Biology		1	3	1	4	1067777	10/25/08	don't take cell bio with newman/wright. you checked this site for a reason. here's your advice, rochester.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	1067777	12/5/07	Dr. Write is a good teacher, sometimes a little out there but really nice and will answer all questions. Does not make you come to class but it's wise to do so. She is pretty cute...so its helper there :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	1	Biology		2	4	2	4	1067777	1/26/13	Her tests are extremely, extremely difficult and her teaching seems random. There isn't much to learn from her class but she has high expectations. Nice person though!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		2	5	5	5	1067777	10/24/11	Cell Biology with Dr. Wright was a pleasure. Her exams are thorough, not difficult; if you pay attention in lecture, and review her power points and study guides for each exam, you should be more then sufficiently prepared. She is extremely approachable and really understands the material. She honestly cares about the well being of her students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	0	Biology	301	2	2	2	3	1067777	4/25/11	There is a reason you use this site, because you need advice. My advice is AVOID AVOID AVOID her AT ALL COSTS! Shes very nice, but her tests are ridiculously hard. Grading scheme: 70%test (drops one test), 20%group assignments, 10%presentation.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		3	5	5	5	1067777	1/23/11	Dr. Wright is great. She covers everything on the slides in class (that you can print), and if you take good enough notes and pay attention, there's no reason why you can't do well on an exam. The book isn't even necessary, TBH. Plus she's really cute and nice, and is always helpful in labs. Definitely take her class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology	350	3	4	4	5	1067777	5/19/10	Professor Wright is an expert on the subject. Very smart woman. And adorable. I had her for molecular and learned a TON.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	1	Biology		2	2	3	3	1067777	12/4/09	Her tests are ridiculously difficult. She tells you that one thing will be on the exam, and it's not. She asks extremely specific questions. And she spends more than half of her class time going over "FYI slides, which you don't need to know". But you will see them on the exam. Take Cell Bio with Perry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology	311	2	5	4	4	1067777	12/2/08	As a professor she is really good. She posts up slides and is very helpful and will answer your questions. She tries to make a great effort to make sure you understand. Her tests are a hard, multiple choice, and makes you think. Really good class. You need to read the book and pay attention to lectures. If you put in a good amount of time then = A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Kate Wright	3.5	2	Biology		4	5	4	4	1067777	3/9/08	Nice, kinda spacey at times, but teaches well. Tests can be challenging, but are always fair. A pleasure to have as a prof for the second time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	4	272131	1/3/13	Even though he was intimidating, tough, and brutally honest, Cliff boosted my confidence in my art. He made me think nothing was impossible to achieve if you really put your blood and sweat into it. I became 10 times the artist I was after just one quarter with him! The lessons I learned from Cliff, I've applied to everything in my life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	3	272131	1/2/13	Your either get it or you don't...the ones that get it are the smart ones. One of Best professor I have had hands down, from RIT & Parsons & life. He demands the best from his students, and teaches something that is almost impossible to teach...demanding the best from yourself & setting the bar for your own work in an "ahha" moment.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	100	1	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	Cliff was incredibly inspiring and motivating. His drawing class was very challenging but the effort really paid off. Cliff always had great insights and could really pull the best out of his students.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	After graduating in 08 from RIT, I have been on a steady course upward in the art world, if it wasn't for his classes none of this would be the case.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	Cliff made my Freshman Year. He is not only the best professor that I have had but he is one of the best people I have ever met. Take his class. You will gain more from his class than you would ever imagine. Taking his class is life changing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	212	2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	Easily the best and coolest profesor I've ever had. I promise you will learn more then you ever imagined from this man!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	5	272131	10/27/11	He will impact your life as an artist and a creative individual, listen to his stories and find meaning in it. He will make you a great artist but he will not make it easy :P
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	272131	3/17/11	Cliff will help you open doors to the drawing abilities you've always wanted. His class is an experience, and he is quite the inspiration. Also, he's hysterical and has the coolest stories. Take this class, you'll never regret it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	211	1	5	4	4	272131	7/14/10	Cliff is an awesome teacher and always inspired me to work harder. It is really rare to find teachers like him who can actually change your life.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	4	272131	10/25/09	much more than a drawing class. Definitely influenced my mindset on my professional and personal life. He also motivated me to work my butt off
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	4	272131	1/3/13	Cliff is so much more than a teacher, he's the most inspiring person I've ever met. You leave the class mentally exhausted but you gain so much more. He teaches not only how to draw, but how to live your life to the fullest, and genuinely cares for his students. Couldn't ask for more.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	4	272131	1/2/13	Cliff is the best. His class isn't easy, and he won't hesitate to tell you that your work isn't good. But if you put in the effort, the rewards are amazing. Do the projects, and do them exactly as he tells you: they are engineered a specific way to teach you the most effectively and help you get the most out of it! Take Cliff's class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	Cliff was a fantastic teacher. Extremely knowledgeable, always willing to take time out of class to help, and most importantly, demanding in the best way. He makes you better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	Cliff is the best professor for those who work hard and seek inspiration in any way possible. The best advice I can give is listen, he'll inspire you to become the best version of yourself.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	2	5	5	5	272131	1/2/13	This man will change your life if you give him your best effort. Great stories and a sometimes gruff exterior compliment a seemingly endless amount of knowledge and ability to help. Listen, try your hardest, and count yourself lucky to have Cliff as your professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	3	4	272131	12/15/11	I graduated from RIT in 2008. Nearly 4 years later, Cliff is the only professor whose classes I still reminisce and tell stories about-- I still draw on lessons I learned in his classes and think on advice he gave me. Even taking his intro classes as an illustration senior, I found every assignment challenging.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	3	272131	6/2/11	Cliff is the best professor you can take in foundations. He not only teaches you about drawing but teaches about life and his experience in the art world. He truly is an inspiration and I have taken more than I would have ever imagined from his class. He is tough and you will put in ridiculous amount of hours into your projects but it's worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	3	272131	10/5/10	There's no way to explain it, you have to experience it. It's hard and easy, it's boring and interesting, it's fast and it's slow. If you want to learn, not just about drawing, take his class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	3	272131	6/16/10	Perhaps the best professor I've ever had. While his assignments may seem hard, they are really a challenge of your ability to focus, learn, and expand skills. If nothing else, they reveal character and how far you will go to achieve success in your field. I have taken more than the required number of classes, and learned something new each time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	3	272131	1/22/09	He is the most amazing person I've almost ever met. He's one of those teachers you remember for the rest of your life, the kind that changes your life, for the better. He's taught me how to rethink the way I look at the world. If you have low self esteem though, don't take his class though because you probably won't be able to handle him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	3	5	272131	7/16/08	Cliff is Cliff. You love him or you hate him. He may be your inspiration or he may cause you to leave art. Personally, I found him to be a great prof and a great example of what you're going to find in the art world. This class will work you hard, scare you, and maybe, give you hope. Don't run away, stick it out. He's tough.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	0	Fine Arts		1	1	3	2	272131	4/30/08	He is a very tough grader, and I didn't like his teaching style. He would tell us the same stories over and over again, and we had to stand for the majority of the time which made the class go on forever. He makes you work very hard, but too much IMO and it negatively affected my grades in my other classes. I am glad i got out of his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	4	4	4	272131	2/5/08	Cliff was the best professor I ever had. He makes you laugh, work hard , learn from your mistakes, see a new point of view, keep sketchbooks of other work to learn from, i found his class to change my life and how I made art. value what you learn, it relates to more than just drawing.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	5	5	272131	10/24/07	Cliff is the reason to take art classes at RIT.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	3	272131	11/1/06	He's an amazing professor. I've learned so much in his class about observation. The level of difficulty fluctuates with each project. He wants students who are going to work their hardest. I don't feel like he calls us out on the spot. I think that he just wants feedback when he's talking to us. I really enjoy his lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	272131	6/2/06	total bad ass. great stories. pushing students to work to their best abilities
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	5	272131	10/30/05	cliff is awesome
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	272131	10/9/05	One of the best professors I have had, He will push you beyond your perceived limits if you are willing to do the work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	272131	9/5/05	best teacher i had at rit

Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	1	Fine Arts	211	1	4	1	4	272131	4/22/08	Well... I suppose if I had been cut out for art, Cliff would have been just the teacher for me. However, the only thing I really learned from him was that I am emotionally incapable to be an artist. Why that matters as a medical illustration major, I'm still not sure, but... whatevs. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts	101	1	5	5	5	272131	11/15/07	Hands down, the best professor I've ever had. He's hard you will see people cry, you might not get good grades. Stick with him, I promise it will be worth everything you put into it in the end. Art majors: take his foundations classes first thing freshman year. If you can get through his classes, you can get through anything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	272131	1/2/07	Best Teacher ever! Really makes you think!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	3	272131	9/22/06	Absolutely the best. Scary at first - TINFOIL - but great stories and great teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	5	272131	10/31/05	He's pretty rough, I hate him and love him at the same time, you have to be willing to work your ass off if you want to get anywhere in his class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	4	5	272131	9/22/05	Cliff's class is one of the hardest ive been in, but he's an amazing teacher, and all the work pays off in the end.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	272131	9/5/05	Very difficult, but he can transform you into something amazing if u listen to him. Cliff doesn't create "good" students, he creates "great" ones. Believe me,when you get into ur upper level classes u can tell who had him and who didn't. U will leave class 90% of the time hating him & pissed off, but in the end u will love & respect him forever.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	5	272131	8/26/05	You will be pushed to your limits of success. This class Gives you all the tools, resources, and knowledge to become unearthly talented. What you do with it is your choice. You will only be what you create.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	272131	3/16/05	he'll make you cry- but is the best teacher i've ever had. i got a D in fall quarter but then an A for winter - do what he says.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	3	3	272131	11/17/04	I would say i learn more from Cliff in one semester than in all of high school. He is very respectible and is very motivational. He positively influences me to better myself at what i do and become great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	NULL	272131	5/15/04	Amazingly insightful and helpful. Really the best professor I've ever had.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	0	Fine Arts		1	2	2	NULL	272131	4/23/04	if you want to work long, long hours and really work your ass off he's a good teacher. Definitely makes up stories and likes to hear himself speak but you'll learn. Not a class for lazy people!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	3	272131	6/17/05	Definately one of the best professors on campus. If you take his class be prepared to work like crazy. You'll have some sleepless nights but it's totally worth it. He's insightful, honest and fair. You might not like what he says about your stuff sometimes but in the end he's usually right. If you want to actually learn something, take his class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		2	5	5	5	272131	1/30/05	Easily the best professor I've had. His 2D Design class laid the foundation for the rest of my college experience, and much of the success I've had in school and afterward I attribute to him. He'll make you want cry and his bravura will probably ****you, but you'll leave changed for the better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		1	5	5	2	272131	11/15/04	excellent with a motormouth that matches his favorite ferarri.keeps class interesting by eating tacks and putting students on the spot.loves to swear like a sailor and often makes you feel like you're in college.dont get **** before class though or he'll make you sing in front of everyone.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Clifford Wun	4.5	2	Fine Arts		3	5	5	NULL	272131	5/4/04	Yes, it's true, you'll work really hard, get brutally honest critiques, but in the end you will have learned much quicker and will respect what you got out of it all.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Lihua XU	3.0	1	Computer Science	452	5	3	3	5	1563426	4/15/11	The class was easy so it is hard to gauge her as a professor. She graded pretty slowly but she was lenient. She has an accent which I noticed throughout the class but it I always could understand her. She tried to speak slowly on purpose to minimize the effects of her accent. Overall, I'd say she was pretty good. I would take her again if possible.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		4	4	3	3	409098	10/23/11	The class was very straightforward and Professor Yang did a decent job teaching things. He mainly puts things up on a projector and we took a few notes but other than that it was a simple class. I have to admit that I find his powerpoint presentations that he posts online more informative than his actual lectures.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering	794	4	5	5	4	409098	2/12/06	Caring professor. Usually avaliable and helpful. Tried his best to explain materials. Understood that students have other courseworks other than his class, deadlines were extended if reasonable request was made.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		4	5	5	2	409098	5/19/05	Unbelievably good, I hate circuits, or at least I did until this class, Yang is the man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		4	5	3	NULL	409098	5/14/04	He's the man. Enough said.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		3	4	4	5	409098	1/31/10	He's extremely nice, and very helpful outside of class if you can find him. He was harder than the rest of the IDS professors, and sometimes didn't explain things very clearly, but just ask him to clarify and he will. Overall, you can't go wrong in IDS with Yang or Melton.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		4	5	4	3	409098	8/12/05	He's a good professor; tries to help his students any way he can. The class can be hard but if you work hard and see him when you need help, he'll help you and make sure your grade reflects your effort and improvement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Shanchieh Yang	4.4	2	Engineering		3	5	4	3	409098	5/1/05	Nice, good professor. Try his best to make students understand the materials. Always avaliable and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		4	5	4	3	66028	11/17/10	Professor Young is very nice, extremely helpful, and a good teacher. Unfortunately, the person who said she is very disorganized is right. The final is today and I have no idea what my standing in the course is. The scary thing is that I'm not sure that she knows either. Good teacher and very helpful, but I need more structure as a student.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		4	5	4	3	66028	1/31/10	very helpful, always willing to sit down with students until they understand. Yes, she does bumble here and there, but quite frankly it's not that bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science	311	3	5	4	4	66028	7/6/08	Dr. Young is tough professor in terms of the work she gives you. There is a lot of work to be done in the course of 10 weeks. However, all that work (Labs, Homework Webassigns, and Classwork) will definitely pay off when you take her exams. The exams are really fair. If you have questions, she WILL make herself available for you. She really cares!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		3	5	4	4	66028	2/28/07	Anne isn't a bad professor. She knows her stuff and is helpful. I guess it depends on what class you take with her. I recommend astronomy as its an easy A, but physics 3 was incredibly difficult with her. Overall she cares about her students..
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	1	Science		3	4	2	5	66028	12/2/06	Stellar Astronomy She was very unorganized. The class was only an hour long, but she crammed so much information into that time. It seemed like she was just throwing handouts at us. Material had to be learned on your own through reading or just by doing the homework. Grading was a little confusing, too. Pulling an A in this class was very difficul
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		2	5	3	2	66028	3/12/06	The best phyics prof. I've had here. Not saying much at RIT, but it is meant as a compliment. Class is rather confusing; taught too quickly, but that is not her fault. Very willing to help outside of class. I found her more helpful outside of class than in because it was 1 on 1. Focuses on concepts, and the homework reflects that. Gives extra cred.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		3	4	4	3	66028	10/18/05	Great teacher, best physics teacher I've had.. I know at RIT that isn't saying much but she's really good. Not easy always, but good.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		2	4	3	NULL	66028	4/7/04	Second semester ive had her. Decent teacher but always willing to help if you dont understand. This semester she has been alot better than she was in the last. Pretty fair teacher, definitely worth taking her course.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science	101	4	5	2	3	66028	10/14/10	Isn't very organized.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science	312	3	4	4	1	66028	1/31/10	Probably the best teacher I've had for Univ Physics, but that's not saying much as they all suck. Would argue with you when you asked questions, but after a few minutes of arguing she'd finally realize what you were asking and explain it. Class is hard, but it's Univ Physics, it's meant to be hard. This prof was easier than most UP profs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	0	Science	320	1	1	1	2	66028	1/14/08	This lady talks WAY too much and the book for the class sucks which makes it even worse! She's the only person who teaches Optics at RIT so she's unavoidable if you must take this class... :(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science	313	4	4	4	4	66028	2/16/07	if you have to take physics 3, take her, she is probably the greatest teacher for such a hard course. She is very nice and just an overall fun teacher, and lover of physics
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	0	Science		2	1	1	2	66028	4/27/06	She was not organized at all. Not clear when she taught. Was not helpful at all. Assigns web assigns twice a week, and hand in homework on paper once a week. Many many worksheets (no help from her)must be there every day, dry material, she does not make it interesting at all. Knew more before I went into the class. She decreased myunderstanding
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	0	Science		2	1	2	5	66028	11/9/05	she's always a compleat mess and is somewhat crazy
Rochester Institute of Technology	Anne Young	3.4	2	Science		4	5	3	4	66028	3/7/05	A closet Calc teacher, this lady will derive equations until you are blue in the face. That being said, she usually offers good drawings or examples and grades easily (Bonus all over the place). Very helpful if you ask her a question one-on-one, but sometimes has strange way of explaining in class.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Young	1.9	2	Engineering		3	4	3	4	13604	10/7/05	He finally cracked everyone, I heard the horror stories just like everyone else but I have him this quarter for Concepts in Systems and Signals, and he's a really good dude, good about questions in class, and very helpful during office hours. I'd say take classes with him now before he has another change of heart
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Young	1.9	1	Engineering		2	3	2	2	13604	4/21/05	I wouldn't recommend this teacher. He is very sarcastic and expects students to be 4.0's. I am not taking a class this quarter because he is teaching it.lol. Hard to follow in class and way too many assignments, grading was sketchy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Young	1.9	0	Engineering		2	1	1	NULL	13604	8/28/01	Worst prof I have EVER had in my life! STAY AWAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	720	5	5	4	3	1246738	1/25/12	He knows his material, has a lot of knowledge in what he is teaching, very very willing and eager to answer your questions - any number of times.Super good Prof, I thoroughly enjoyed his class. Totally worth it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	217	4	5	4	4	1246738	11/4/11	Prof Yu knows his stuff, loves to answer questions to make sure ppl "get" the material. Super nice (and cute), works through tons of ACUTAL code, and makes all lectures available on mycourses. His pronunciation of certain words is...entertaining b/c of his accent, but pay attention, and you'll have no prob understanding him. New to java? Take him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology		3	5	4	4	1246738	10/24/11	Great professor!Don't make fun of him because of the way he talks.He definitely knows his stuff and he tries to make the class fun.He's always there to answer your questions through email and in class during labs.He gives you a week for hw and labs,tells you specifically what will be on the exams, always around to help. I'm so lucky I had him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	217	4	5	4	4	1246738	12/1/10	New teacher. But he's very nice and open to his students. I had no problem understanding him. You'll find yourself typing code more than looking at the slides. Definitely knows his stuff. If I had a problem in class, if he came over to look at my code I'd not only learn what was wrong but I learned how to fix it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	484	3	4	3	4	1246738	9/14/09	Nice guy and knows a lot about databases. Not the most clear some of the time, but overall I would recommend him. Class consists of tests and group projects that are graded easily. No book use.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	1	Information Technology	484	3	4	2	3	1246738	1/18/09	Very new professor has to learn we need reminding of due dates. Defiantly knows his stuff, just a little hard to understand at times.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	217	4	5	5	5	1246738	11/28/11	He is a good professor, especially for Java novices. He always provides large amounts of examples in lecture.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology		5	5	4	5	1246738	10/27/11	He is an awesome teacher that made me so horny, that me love him long time
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	1	Information Technology		3	4	2	1	1246738	2/7/11	He's a really nice guy, and tries to make the class enjoyable. However, listening to him read powerpoint slides in his broken English is... painful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology	218	5	5	4	4	1246738	11/13/10	This guy knows his stuff and teaches by having the class actually doing the programming, rather than spending time on lecture slides. He is extremely willing to help you out and if you try you will do well in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	QI YU	4.1	2	Information Technology		1	5	3	5	1246738	5/24/09	Novice professor but puts a lot of effort into students that try , needs work on class organization
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	4	2	606030	1/2/12	He was by far one of the best professor I have ever had. I took Cal 1 from in 2003. He was also available to answer questions and the extra credit on the tests helped. I did very well in the class because of him and inspite of not being good at Math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics	501	2	4	4	5	606030	3/4/09	He is my favorite professor in undergraduate Math program. His class is challenging but super clear. He makes me learn a lot and get good grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		2	3	1	2	606030	6/3/08	He's a good guy and all, but assigns a lot of homework and doesn't give any partial credit (after only grading a little of it). Then he hits you with tests and/or quizes that are harder than the homework, or weren't gone over at all on the homework. He can be helpful at office hours though. He rambles and is a difficult grader on tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics	231	2	5	4	3	606030	3/3/08	Zablow is a good man... One of the best math teachers I have had in my career. First, go to class. It may feel slow, but he is consistent, clear and accurate. Do your homework and completely. You get nearly no credit for wrong answers/incomplete. Expect about 4 quizzes 3 Q's long. About 2 tests 6 Q's. Good teacher, give him a try.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		4	4	4	2	606030	2/20/08	He is an amusing professor and he always answers any questions that the class has. He makes sure he clearly explains the material, lectures are kind of long though. He always has time to help the students outside of class and if he is busy, he schedules appointments with them. Good professor!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		1	4	3	3	606030	10/22/07	A challenging professor. Talks a lot about abstract ideas. If you can follow him in class then you're set. His tests are very difficult, although he DOES give extra credit. Don't worry too much about doing poorly on a quiz or two. Study for the tests. There is a fair amount of homework. If you like math, you'll like this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics	200	2	5	4	3	606030	5/1/07	Great professor, very willing to go over things, and receptive to questions. He goes over problems in extreme detail, & I found his tests to be reasonable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics	282	2	2	2	4	606030	3/2/07	Not a good teacher. Talked quietly and wrote messy on the board. Did not give much partial credit on tests and quizzes. Gives lots of homework. Does not explain material very well. He will help you during office hours but he is hard to catch. I relied on a good TA.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	606030	2/1/07	He is really good teacher. Easy and can get a good grade. Handwriting is small and sometimes hard to read but a nice man and best Teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics	282	4	5	5	3	606030	10/24/06	He's a very nice, and reasonable guy. Very fair in his expectations and workload, and is willing to explain any points of confusion. Highly Recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		2	5	5	5	606030	3/1/10	He is the best professor ever! I have been a Math major from freshman year to grad. school. His class is challenging but super clear. He makes me learn a lot and get good grades.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	1	606030	9/5/08	He's really energetic, which is usually fine - you don't get bored in that class even though the material sucks. He's a bit on the nutty side. Though sometimes his tests are ridiculously hard, in my opinion, I had a solid B up until the last test (2 days b4 the end of class), then the final, and I came out with a D - Do all the h/w and study!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	1	Mathematics	265	2	2	3	2	606030	5/13/08	I hate to admit, the worst professor I have had at RIT. Quizzes are hard, class is boring, NO partial credit. Even if you understand the material, he will put a question on there unlike any of the ones in the homework. Expect low quiz grades, he gives almost no partial credit...even for a small algebra mistake. Hated every minute of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics	101	2	4	4	1	606030	2/20/08	Zablow was a great teacher. Really down to earth. The only problem I had was my own fault. If you put in the work (and there's a lot of it here) then you're sure to do fine. I had to drop the class, but that was because I didn't do any of the homework. DO IT! It'll save you. But as a guy, he's great. Taking him again next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	1	Mathematics		1	3	2	1	606030	10/22/07	Homework was graded by the TA so I can't hold that against him. His quizzes and test are only like 5 questions and all the questions are not just conceptual questions, but quite advanced.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics	272	1	2	2	2	606030	10/5/07	From my experience it is safe to say that most of the reviews here are just about right. Tests and quizzes total 3-5 questions with limited amount of partial credit and they're pretty challenging so getting more than 1 question wrong can severely cripple your grade. Also homeworks sometimes span past 4-5 pages and can take hours to do.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics	283	2	2	2	4	606030	3/9/07	Very nice guy, but not a great teacher. He is very willing to help, but often it not very clear in his ways of explaining things. This can make it difficult to follow along in class. Along with his quiet voice and hard to follow writing, it is very easy to lose focus in class and become confused and do poorly on tests. I do not reccommend

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	1	Mathematics		2	3	3	4	606030	1/7/07	His way of teaching makes math so hard. His quiz are hard, he likes everything extremely detailed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	606030	3/5/06	This was absolutely the worst teacher i have ever had. His tests are impossible and his grading is crazy. never take his classes.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		2	2	1	5	606030	2/23/06	Writes so small that I had a hard time reading the board from the FRONT ROW. Lectures like a child, and makes tons of mistakes. I made minor mistake on a quiz and lost 31 points! He also had a habit of BARELY mentioning an unimportant topic, and then making it 1/3 of a quiz. Also, with 2 quizzes and 2 tests, it's impossible to pull your grade up.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		3	4	3	1	606030	12/8/05	hard tests and quizzes. he speaks quiet and writes small. make sure to sit up front. class isn't impossible.. i somehow got an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	606030	11/19/05	Terrible professor, learned almost nothing from his lectures, tests frequently included materials not covered either in class or in the book. Avoid this guy like the plague
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	606030	11/1/05	Doesn't explaing anything in terms you understand, copies everything out of book...I could have done his job
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		1	3	4	4	606030	10/17/05	Zablow is a pretty bad teacher but he's a nice guy. His lectures are pretty boring. He teaches right out of the textbook and he grades VERY hard. He's probably the hardest teacher I've had so far. You really have to teach yourself if you want to do well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	606030	9/3/05	This is the worst professor i ever had. I went in for extra help and he was more interested in talking to other students not in his classes. He copied our textbook word for word and would NOT go into a topic anymore than the examples... AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	606030	5/23/05	Seriously, think about this guy as having some highly contagious disease and then having to spend a quarter with him. AVOID HIM!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	4	606030	4/26/05	Incredible extra credits on tests tho i must say ppl still fail them. i had a test wit max score 125/100. he explains a process, gives solves an example for u, summarizes the steps for that prob, then generalize the process for all probs. nice guy but if u kno the stuff he gets boring
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	5	606030	1/24/06	Thought he was a really good teacher, and a pretty helpful guy. I found the exams to be easy, although the project was a little on the difficult side. More than willing to talk about any other mathematics if you're interested in it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	2	606030	12/6/05	Incredibly hard. Gives tests with 5 problems and very little partial credit. He mumbles at the board, has a very nasal voice, and you can't possibly read all of what he writes on the board. He seems like a nice guy and he's very smart, but he's not a teacher. Avoid his class if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	606030	11/3/05	He sucks dont take him unless you like watching people write on the board all class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	606030	10/19/05	I agree with all the negative comments here. He claims he gives you extra credit. This is a total fallacy. If you make one minor mistake, you get 0 credit for the whole problem. This is a MAJOR issue when there are only 3 questions on the quizzes and 5 on the exams. Expect to do poorly. Also, he speaks VERY quietly and writes TINY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	606030	10/17/05	unfair, and teaches right out of the book... if you dont understand the book, dont ask him for help because he goes right out of the book anyhow........... >:0(
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	606030	8/24/05	Horrible teacher, impossible tests. Material covered on tests had absolutely nothing to do with homeworks and workshops, over 50% of the class failed the course and he didnt see a problem with it
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	606030	4/29/05	This professor is a joke. Teaches verbatim right out of the book and still gets the problems wrong. He gets almost beligerent and angry when you ask him questions. yeah, he may give extra credit on the exams, but nobody ever gets it bc he grades so harshly. Advice: Such a joke, skip him!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joel Zablow	2.7	0	Mathematics	432	2	1	2	3	606030	2/15/05	Just read the book instead because his notes are exactly word for word out of it. I paid tution to be taught by the professors and all he taught was the board because thats all he looked at the entire class time. NOT A GOOD TEACHER TO TAKE!!(unless you cant read). you also get NO breaks grading!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Paul Zam	4.0	2	Information Technology		4	4	4	5	1460965	7/15/10	Teaches online classes only so it is hard to compare to a normal professor. Pretty slow at answering emails and posting grades. Also unclear about assignments at times. Pretty easy going when it comes to grading.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Zandy	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1399242	1/22/13	Hilarious and personable guy. Can't think of anything else to say.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Zandy	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	4	1399242	10/22/12	Zandy is a fun teacher. He tells fun stories and teaches you to 'respect the game'. You will get out of the class exactly what you would want.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Zandy	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1399242	11/30/10	Took him for pocket billiards wellness class and he is the best. Knows how to play and teaches his students well. Gives great advice. I've definitely gotten better at pool since I took the class. Definitely recommended!
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Zandy	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	5	1399242	12/3/12	Bill is the man. He understands that this is just a wellness class and he keeps the lessons simple and clear. He is funny and he cares about making you a better pool player. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	William Zandy	5.0	2	Physical Education		5	5	5	4	1399242	10/15/11	This man is hilarious. And a great teacher. Highly recommended.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Wyffels	5.0	2	Engineering	250	2	5	5	5	1404141	1/26/11	He is also the head of the tech crew, all of his classes are very real world, and he backs up his information with amazing stories of the real world music industry.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		3	5	5	5	347571	3/4/11	Yamashita sensei is the best japanese teacher I've had so far. She's less strict than Murakami and she is much better at explaining concepts and answering questions. Her accent is also not as thick so her English is much clearer. It's too bad she only seems to teach Beginning Japanese I. If you have the opportunity take her class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		3	5	5	5	347571	1/16/08	Most definitely one of the best professors RIT has to offer. She's the head of the department so she knows how to teach well. She can sometimes be a bit intimidating, but she's absolutely approachable if you ever need any help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		5	5	5	5	347571	8/12/05	She was always extremely helpful and approachable in and out of class. The class itself was a lot of work, but if you did the work and came to her when you didn't understand something, she was more than happy to point you in the right direction and help you stay on the right track.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		4	5	5	5	347571	1/26/11	She was a great, funny, and very approachable teacher. She's the head of the Foreign Language Dept so she knows her stuff. Definitely get into one of her classes if you can.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		3	5	5	5	347571	7/26/06	She's very good at teaching the Beginning Japanese I class because she helps you ease into learning what can be a rather difficult language. She's always very helpful in and outside of class, and very approachable...I highly recommend her for any class!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hiroko Yamashita	5.0	2	Japanese		4	5	5	NULL	347571	2/2/04	Yama****a sensei is definately one of the best professors at RIT hands down. She always makes sure we understand the information she is teaching us, and she is definately committed to our success. She is always available outside of class for extra help.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jeanne Yamonaco	5.0	2	English		4	5	5	3	1189079	3/15/10	Once you do her assignments and attend all of her classes. You ll be her favorite student. She is very sweet person. You should take a class under her when you need an easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Bridgette Yaxley	1.5	0	Writing	227	2	1	2	1	1038882	10/16/07	A horrible teacher that only cares about format and grammar. She teaches nothing about actually writing a good essay and is extremely picky about attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		5	1	1	2	67421	3/13/13	Do not take unless you enjoy a teacher who states he is slightly illiterate, can't go past 2*2 in arithmetic and constantly rambles about nonsense material regarding physics, calculus, coding in FORTRAN, making taking attendance mandatory and his inconsistent office hour schedule.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	205	2	1	1	4	67421	10/8/12	He babbles on and on and doesn't answer questions well. You can tell he's trying but he fails. There is a lot of textbook use if you can't understand him but if you can understand him and his lectures than you don't even need the book.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	2	67421	2/4/12	Second time having Young, had him for Discrete 1. He likes to go off tangent and makes mistakes. To succeed in his class, make sure you practice his problems on the worksheets he hands out. Just do them, and his weekly quizzes are a breeze, easy 27-30/30 on them. Grading is simple. He only counts 6/8 best quizzes and then the final. He's alright
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics	205	5	4	3	2	67421	10/18/11	He is a very good teacher if you have a strong backround in mathematics. He does go on little rants that may last no longer than 2 minutes on pointless stuff but he is an easy teacher. He'll take 6/8 highest quizzes so if you mess up you get some redemption.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	265	2	1	1	1	67421	1/26/11	One of the worst professors I've had at RIT. He is very difficult to follow and understand. He "teaches" you how to do something once and then proceeds to go through examples really fast afterward. He's not very good with answering questions and he can't seem to ever stay on topic. My Advice: DO NOT TAKE DISCRETE MATH WITH ELMER YOUNG.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics	265	4	3	3	4	67421	10/21/10	Extremely easy A if you know what you're doing on the tests. The lectures are as clear as you'd expect any lecture to be, the guy's a lot of fun. He makes a lot of mistakes, so pay attention and don't be afraid to let him know. He's crazy, but he's smart and it was a good class to take.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		5	2	2	3	67421	3/26/10	If you're coming into RIT with proramming experience and a solid background in math his Discrete 1 class is an easy A. Just don't bother talking to him... he mutters and goes off on tangents and constantly talks about Pepsi machines, but is possible to follow if you put some effort into it. No homework, easy quiz every Friday, and very generous with partial credit. Didn't use the textbook, don't buy it unless you're planning to take Discrete 2 with a different prof.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	205	4	2	2	2	67421	6/7/09	I didn't actually learn much in class, he's hard to follow sometimes. I survived the class by sitting with friends. Do the worksheets though, and you'll do fine on the quizzes and final... although you may have to do some studying on your own if you expect to understand everything.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	265	3	1	1	2	67421	4/29/09	My theory is Young does crack! Do not take this course without a friend or a personal tutor because his teaching is so bad. TIPS FOR PASSING: his quizes have what you learned the week before and the prior quiz. Do all of his worksheets and understand them because those are how to quizes will look. You grade is based only on quizes and the final.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	265	1	1	2	4	67421	3/12/09	Very difficult to follow; he progresses through the material very fast and concentrates more on demonstrating proofs for a concept than explaining that concept so students can understand. Not recommended unless you can learn the material all on your own.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		5	4	5	4	67421	3/6/13	Probably one of my favorite professors so far. He sometimes went off on tangents, but it wasn't excessive. If anything, it kept me engaged. The grade for Discrete I consisted of weekly quizzes, a mid-term, and a final. He did give optional homework, which he went over in class, but I never did any of it. As long as you pay attentoin, he's great.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics	265	5	3	3	3	67421	5/24/12	He's an Ok teacher. People are correct in the fact that he goes off on random tangents. However, if you do the examples and ask questions he will explain them. He'll sometimes start to answer a question before you're done asking it, so if he answers the wrong thing, just interrupt and finish your question.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		4	4	3	3	67421	10/25/11	He is an alright professor.He knows math but makes alot mistakes.His grading system is simple:he counts only 6/8 quizzes & the final exam.He gives homework that won't count but he recommends you do them.DO THEM!They are helpful for the quizzes.Also he does go off topic alot.He may mention about purple cows.Go to him or look on internet if need help
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	1	67421	10/12/11	One of the worst teachers i have ever had. "You know this game" seems to be his tagline, however many of us were left clueless as he never made sense and constantly made mistakes and got himself off topic all the time
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	67421	11/22/10	I did most of my studying from the book. His handwriting is quite a challenge to read and he spends a ridiculous amount of time going off on tangents. I recommend another professor who gives more homework, which is the best way to learn discrete math.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics	206	4	4	4	2	67421	3/28/10	He goes on tangents occasionally, but is generally a good teacher. His homeworks (not graded, he just recommends doing the problems) are usually very similar to the test questions. Plenty of office hours if you're stuck on something
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	265	5	2	2	4	67421	1/31/10	Often writes with 4 colors at the same time. Most of the material was basic arithmetic, but he wasn't very good at arithmetic. Class was extremely easy though, it was just arithmetic really, one test per week, lowest two dropped.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	2	67421	4/30/09	He is absolutely crazy, one class he said pigeon over and over for five minutes. He often spoke of being abducted by aliens and purple cows. He hands out more worksheet than you can handle, but you don't have to go to class and his tests are easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	265	5	1	3	1	67421	4/21/09	I can't decide whether he's a horrible or great teacher based on the fact that I got an A and didn't understand his lectures. Either way, he's really easy grader and gives no homework for Discrete I. If you want to learn something, I suggest taking someone else.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	67421	3/10/09	Had him for Discrete II. He rambles on about random stuff including philosophy, building 70, and makes unfunny jokes that make no sense. He hands out a bunch of worksheets everyday that no one does. He is horrible at answering students questions and never seems to understand what anyone is trying to say (and no one understands what he is saying)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		4	2	2	2	67421	12/17/08	Prof. Young isn't really a good teacher per se, but if you get math and want to breeze through with almost no work then he is awesome. Class is not mandatory, if you know it just come for the tests. If you learn quick, his handouts cover everything on the weekly quizzes. If you're stupid, avoid him at all costs.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	3	67421	10/21/08	Should not be teaching. Takes points off if you don't follow his little quirks even if you are technically right. Does not really focus, goes off on tangents and is really too old to be teaching.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67421	3/13/08	I've only been to 2 classes so far, and I can already tell that this is the class I will hate. This guy rambles on about things that have nothing to do with the class, goes so fast through the material that NO ONE in the class gets it, and doesn't answer any of our questions clearly. UGH.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics	206	3	4	4	4	67421	10/24/07	Honestly, First week and a half of class, I couldn't understand the man. After that, it clicked. Enjoyed the class, and he was very concerned that students understood material before he would quiz us on the material. I can see him not being for all students though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	318	4	1	1	1	67421	4/28/07	This guy is a joke. One of the worst I've ever had. Can't understand him at all, let alone follow the notes. Good luck because you will need it if you take anything from this guy. STAY AWAY!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	1	67421	12/19/06	Horrible... this man rambles on and on about nothing. He had to sub for one of my teachers for two weeks and when he gets bored he starts new topics even if you don't understand them. He is very boring and is terrible at explaining anything. I thought his ramblings may be entertaining, but that's so far from the truth! Stay Away from Young!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics	231	3	3	2	3	67421	11/16/06	hes a good guy in person, never stops rambling on about usless information, and the math majors. quizzes are fairly easy. doenst explain what he's doin on the board to well, and when he does doesnt make to much sence.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics		5	4	2	2	67421	10/21/06	Good:He is a very nice and EASY to get good grades. We had 8 easy tests and he only counted best 5. All our homework was for bonus points. Bad: Can be quiet. His writting is messy. Doesn't move through material fast enough or explain that well. Expects you to learn it by watching him do examples. Gets sidetracked. I am now expert on bld 70!

Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	3	67421	2/17/06	WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT? Chicken scratch on the board, rambles all over the place, makes no sense, makes jokes at things that are not really funny. Makeup tests are nice, but don't make up for the fact that you don't have a real teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	205	4	1	1	3	67421	11/4/08	Goes off on tangents all the time. I think he thinks that he is teaching history. He says something will not be on the quiz but will keep on talking about it forever. He voice also is wicked monotone. Not the teacher to have if you want to stay awake in class
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	2	1	67421	3/30/08	For at least two or three weeks I could not understand or catch on, towards the end of the quarter I got it. Unfortunately I learned more in 1 hour per week in the Math lab than I did 4 hours a week with this man. I think he grades fairly, and might be one of the easier graders.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics		4	3	3	3	67421	3/8/08	Pretty easy, quizzes every Friday. Handouts pretty much told you what was on each quiz
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	2	67421	5/4/07	Absolutely Horrible!!! He rambles all class long. He can't clarify when questions are asked, so he repeats himself, and if you still don't get it, I can't count the number of times he's said "I don't know what to tell you." My whole class is lost during lectures. Save yourself a major headache do what it takes to avoid this guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	3	67421	2/2/07	I gave up his class after the third week as I knew I was going NOWHERE with his class. He keeps on talking about "blg 70" and all sort of stuff that just makes no sense AT ALL. He scribbles stuff on the board which NO ONE in the class can understand....the only thing I can say is that STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics	205	1	1	1	2	67421	11/16/06	Where do I begin? Elmer rambles forever, doesn't grade too fairly, homework doesn't help that much, scribbles all over the board everyday. If you don't understand his material, your not the first. he won't stop talking about the people in building 70, he obviously hates them, and will make sure you know this at least once a day. Good luck...

Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	4	67421	4/6/06	Nice person, but what class is he really teaching? He's talked about anything from movie reviews to roman history. He starts out on something that we are supposed to learn, then ends up somewhere else, maybe even philosophy. dont take his class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67421	2/27/06	BAD! For your sanity (and your grade as well) run for your life. "is that true?" is heard at least about 5 times a day in the most random places. Makes bad jokes and goes on irrelevant tangents. Almost always does the textbook make more sense than him. Unfortunately, the reverse never happens. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	5	67421	2/17/06	Oh dear god run for your life, this man will destroy your ability to do even the most elementary of math. He is terrible, and yes he does say "is that true?", and talks NON-stop about people in building 70, so unhelpful, i UNLEARNED discrete II. Run! Fast! Dont look back, rivals bad teaching ability with gruber!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	3	67421	2/6/06	Do not take this professor. After the first week I tried to transfer out to another section but the others were full. He just rambles about random stuff and course sequences. He repeats his jokes at least 50 times and he teaches in a way that you cant relate to the book. He stomps around the room in his boots and is the worst teacher I have ever ha
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		4	1	1	3	67421	9/27/05	Never talkes about what he is doing on the board. Cant get his mind off of fortran. doesn't particularly understand how anyone could not understand what he is teaching so he repeats himself instead of clearifying. didnt assign work at all really and rattles on about the beurocracy here at RIT. spent 1st week of class talking about the change in the calculus sequence course numbers.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	2	67421	9/6/05	this guy is nuts, he seems like a good person and all but he doesnt explain a thing that he is doing and it drives me crazy, like we're all just supposed to know?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	5	67421	9/13/04	He's the nicest guy ever. I wish he's my grandpa. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	5	NULL	67421	7/29/04	This guy couldn't make the class any easier! He does so many examples and gives you solutions to anything you can't figure out. Makeups on exams all the time, if you mess up his class, it's your fault.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	NULL	67421	4/18/04	This guy is just rediculous. He treats the class like a group of fellow mathematicians to whom he is trying to prove his greatness. He flies through problems without stopping and never gives clear answers to students' questions. Avoid him at all costs
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		5	5	5	NULL	67421	2/14/03	Anyone who doesnt like him has no sense of humor. Impossible to not get an A
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	2	2	NULL	67421	12/11/02	tends to go off on tangents, doesn't explain very well. +: he gives many makeups
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	1	Mathematics		2	4	1	NULL	67421	12/3/02	if you don't fall asleep during his class, u're probably one of the philosophers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	2	4	67421	10/18/05	Terrible, "is that true?" Awful teacher, "it's just those people in building 70". "Now I'm getting into trouble aren't I?" take the class if you like the above phrases, otherwise don't bother because he repeats those instead of teaching
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		3	1	1	4	67421	9/19/05	He sucks, I ask him a question.. about MATH (you know.. what he's supposed to be teaching) and he starts talking about building 70. I love math, and I am usually awesome at it... except with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		2	1	1	2	67421	3/24/05	The most abhorrible teacher I've ever had. When you ask him something he doesn't know, he'll come up with an excuse for not answering it. Eighty percent of everything he says is about other courses and "the people in building 70." It's impossible to learn anything from this man.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	2	Mathematics		3	5	3	NULL	67421	8/18/04	He didn't lag behind for people didn't want to pay full attention to what was going on. All his assignments were very straight forward. The subject matter is difficult, but what are you going to do?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Elmer Young	1.9	0	Mathematics		1	1	1	NULL	67421	5/12/04	I can't stand this guy. You can't get anything out of him. The only good thing are remake tests which are harder than the first one. I can get A's in any class but his.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	11/7/12	Taken all classes this guy offers...If you don't get an A I'm not sure how you made it into college...this guy gives every opportunity for an A and his classes are very entertaining. Lots of great films and stories.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	11/20/11	He's really laid back and likes to joke a lot. He gives you no homework and allows you to have an entire review sheet for the final exam, along with exactly with whats on the test. He gives you many times to earn bonus points and you can use your laptop the entire class. Amen.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	7/23/11	Professor Younker is the best Professor i've had at RIT in my liberal arts classes. Very engaging and very fair

Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	4	5	3	468883	5/2/07	great teacher. knows what he's talking about. has a lot of experience considering the culture that he comes from. tells a lot of great stories and makes the class fun. everything is very straight forward. gives a lot of extra credit. it's hard not to do well in this class. if you have to take the class, i highly recoment having him as a teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	3	468883	1/12/07	Took Cultural Anthropology, not my choice, but he was a great professor. Mixing Native American culture into his presentations helped give the course a honest and open feel. He told some great stories, brought items for us to see. Fun class. If you have a free elective to take, this is a good choice. Not too much work.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	1	468883	3/13/06	Awesome. He talks and it's interesting. He makes the information just fly into your head. Show up, listen, get an A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	4	5	4	468883	12/25/05	Ditto with other happy comments, good class activities good, tests pretty much from powerpoint easy A but not a complete waste of time bc material is interesting.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology	446	5	5	5	5	468883	3/1/12	Highly recommend. Had for Cultural Anthro and Native North Americans, I learned so much in each class and loved coming to each class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology	510	4	5	5	2	468883	10/3/11	Fun and easy class. If you fail this class you really didn't care. I wasn't to interesed in taking this class but I actually learned a lot. His anecdotes about his Native American culture make this class much more enjoyable and engaging. I definatley recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	4	468883	1/31/11	He is a great professor! I enjoyed his class a lot. I loved the stories he would tell, it would make every class so much better. He even gives you candy :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	3	468883	11/9/09	Show up, review powerpoints on mycourses before quizzes & midterm/final, easy A. Extra credit for attending all lectures; lectures involve fun stories & entertaining movies, and "attendance" means "initial a sheet and you're free to go", Great for majors with heavy course loads. Best elective I've ever taken, bar none.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	4	468883	11/1/07	Awesome teacher. Doesn't have the attitude "my class is the only one you're taking so I'm going to give you a ton of work and there's no reason you shouldn't be able to get it done." He's very fair, easy to listen to, likes to tell a lot of stories and show a lot of movies in class. Travels a lot on weekends, returns with pics.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	9/19/07	One of the most entertaining class on campus. I highly recommend this teacher if you want to make a requirement fulliment. A lot of activities, movies, lectures, and not boring. You will love his stories
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	5	468883	2/8/07	He made learning the material fun. Attendance was not mandatory but if you went to class everyday, you got extra credit for it. All the material was in power points that were listed on mycourses, which made studyign for quizes very easy and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	3	468883	10/25/06	Had him for Cultural Anthropology. I was put in this course not by choice and didn't know what to expect at all. He made class fun, good speaker, story teller. Overall, good class, would definitely recommend.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		4	4	4	3	468883	1/23/06	Great teacher. Gave plenty of extra credit and his classes were interesting. Tells alot of really interesting stories.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	3	468883	11/29/05	Interesting personality and unique teaching style that incorporates activities and videos. Lectures were usually short and teasts were nearly directly from powerpoints. Great class as an elective.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	10/5/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		4	5	5	2	468883	10/27/04	Good / Fun Class, talked about his own work and experiences a lot. Would recommend as an elective anytime.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	5	468883	8/31/05	Very smart and interesting teacher. Makes the class fun. Tells stories from his childhood and stories from his tribe, both of which very entertaining. An all around great teacher who knows what he's talking about with many years experience.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Jason Younker	4.9	2	Anthropology		5	5	5	2	468883	10/6/04	Really neat, he talks a lot about his Native American Tribe, and it's facinating stuff. Did an activity with M&Ms, just a generally fun class. Easy and entertaining, a good choice for filling up your Social Science credit requirement.
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	1	Information Technology		2	3	3	3	736826	2/28/12	Bo is a great person, but not the best of teachers. Reads from the slides and can be extremely dry. You must do all the work in the class. No extra credit offered this quarter. Asks esoteric questions on the exams. Avoid if possible, get ready for a C if you can't.
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	1	Information Technology	365	3	4	2	5	736826	7/23/11	I had Crypto with Bo. He's great if you approach him in his office but not the best in class. Thank god for the bonus points because my crib sheet was insanely in depth but the Midterm/Final just pulls the most random information from the most random slides
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	0	Information Technology	365	3	1	3	4	736826	1/8/11	Terrible Prof! All he does is copy and pasted "his" slides directly from the textbook. Which is a problem because the book is not great and he doesnt know the material. If you ask him a question, he has to look back in his notes and try to find a answer
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	2	Information Technology	365	2	5	5	5	736826	12/18/09	Bo can be a dry lecturer but he makes cryptography fun. The grading is very harsh but theres extra credit in there to pad the grade. Grade definitely reflects your level of dedication. If you get bored, count the number of things he cannot pronounce right
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	0	Information Technology	413	4	2	2	4	736826	1/29/09	A little hard to understand sometimes, but fairly detailed, and will repeat and clarify if he mispronounces his Engrish. VERY dry in his delivery, spends half the class reviewing the class before. Enjoys telling stories of China and ping pong. Not the worst professor to take, but definitely not the best.
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	2	Information Technology	460	5	4	5	5	736826	11/26/11	Had Bo for Malware. Its a pretty easy class, just show up and listen. Labs are 10% a pop, so be thorough!
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	0	Information Technology	365	1	1	3	4	736826	1/11/11	Never take for any class! He hardly knows the material that he is teaching. He is more concerned with telling us events from china. The way he teaches is showing us powerpoints that are all copied out of the text. The text sucks and has little to no examples. Dont ask a question, because he will have to check back in his notes for the answer.Avoid!
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	2	Information Technology	365	4	4	4	3	736826	10/20/10	While the occasional word or two may be difficult to understand, by and large Bo communicates relatively complex Cryptography concepts in ways that are completely understandable even to a layman. Along with being a very nice guy, Bo is always ready to help and the workload is relatively light.
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	1	Information Technology	403	1	4	2	3	736826	2/16/09	Professor Bo is sometimes hard to understand. He will not give you anything unless you earn it. If you forget something he won't care. If you do the work you should have no problem getting a B. He goes off on tangents about China and show videos of Ping Pong Championship just before he starts his lectures. I would take him again no problem.
Rochester Institute of Technology	BO Yuan	3.0	0	Information Technology	415	4	1	1	1	736826	6/11/08	I was forced to take a class with this Professor since he was the only one who taught Wireless. His class was more of a Hardware Engineering class then any sort of IT Class. He is hard to understand and teaches primarily off of slides. He also frequently goes off topic to talk about China or ping pong. I advise against any class with him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andronique Zacharakis	4.2	2	Chemistry		5	4	4	3	1648630	2/10/12	I did very poorly on the first test and quiz, but she let the class retake the first test and quiz as homework assignments if you did good on the second quiz. I thought I was going to fail halfway through the quarter, but ended up with an A because she dropped the lowest test and quiz also
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andronique Zacharakis	4.2	2	Chemistry	217	4	5	4	3	1648630	11/28/11	She gives ample opportunity for extra credit and even threw one of the exams out. She was very receptive when the class was doing poorly and was a great help when I didn't understand topics. I highly recommend this professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andronique Zacharakis	4.2	2	Chemistry	442	3	5	4	3	1648630	2/1/12	Had her for quantum chemistry and she is by far the best! Will work with students after class and is always cheerful and happy which makes learning better. She gives extra credit and there is alot of homework but the homework will only benefit you. Definitely recommend her to anyone!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Andronique Zacharakis	4.2	2	Chemistry		3	4	4	2	1648630	11/18/11	Seems extremely knowledgeable about polymer technology and chemistry in general, but lectures can be confusing if you're not good at chemistry. Most quiz questions are straight off the homework, so if you do the homework you will do fine. She also gave multiple very easy extra credit questions that add points to your OVERALL average. Easy A.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Zandy	4.3	2	English		3	5	5	5	1039986	4/15/09	Professor Zandy is a great teacher. Being a photo major, I took Photography and Writing with her. She is very passionate and knowledgeable about photography. Every photo major should take her class. Really insightful and sensitive. She is kind-hearted and will readily sit with you and chat.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Zandy	4.3	2	English		5	5	5	3	1039986	11/14/08	I love Zandy! She is the best professor I've had thus far not only does she know what she is talking about but is willing to help you through! As for the above comment of her being "condescending" she is anything but nice and caring. The key is to be intelligent.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Zandy	4.3	2	English		2	5	4	4	1039986	10/18/07	Amazing professor. Extremely intellectual. You will want to stay and listen forever!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Zandy	4.3	2	English		2	4	4	3	1039986	3/25/09	Zandy taught me a lot about editing. She is tough but wants you to do well. She likes to promote herself by bring in books she's written every class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Janet Zandy	4.3	1	English		2	3	3	2	1039986	10/15/08	Very difficult grader, very nit-picky. Lets you do re-writes though, and is understanding. Somewhat condescending. If you want an A, you can get it, though.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	350	5	5	5	5	1548270	11/29/12	Best Professor for Corporate Finance. He makes the material very easy to understand. He knows how to teach extremely well. You don't need the textbook but I read it anyway because it's my major. Test, quizzes and homework are all from the power point slides, which he prints out and gives to you. Would recommend this professor to anyone!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	101	3	5	5	3	1548270	3/3/12	Excellent teacher! Hes very enthusiastic about teaching and is more than willing to meet with you if you need help. Not the easiest teacher, but you will defiantly learn!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	101	3	5	4	3	1548270	5/21/11	Nicest professor I've had at RIT! He genuinely cares about students understanding of the material. Makes corporate finance very easy to understand. Overall awesome guy!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	350	4	5	5	5	1548270	4/21/11	One of the greatest professors ever! Passes out copies of all lecture notes, quizzes are all open book. Spends as much time to go over what people don't understand and more than happy to meet with students outside of class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	453	4	5	5	4	1548270	4/27/12	Makes learning hard material as easy as possible. HW once a week, Quizzes are open note/book, & Tests you get a formula sheet. As long as you look over notes should be fine. Very clear about expectations and always willing to help. One of my favorite professors.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	101	5	5	5	5	1548270	1/27/12	One of the best professors hands down. Nice guy who cares about his classes and it shows. Very clear on expectations and learning materials. Book is in the Library and but you need to buy a $28 calculator.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance	350	5	5	5	5	1548270	5/17/11	Great professor, easy to follow, easy to understand aside from a slight accent, and presents and assesses material logically.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Hao Zhang	4.9	2	Finance		4	5	4	5	1548270	3/11/11	Great teacher, his slides are fantastic and help you study.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	101	1	1	3	3	1364418	2/1/12	Never does the labs in class. Our entire class nearly failed our final because 4 of the 10 problems on it were never even discussed in class with him. Has a big temper problem and takes forever to grade anything. Gives no hints on mastering physics and never teaches us how to do it until after it's due, and his grading is overly harsh
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	1	Physics		3	2	3	3	1364418	11/14/11	Has a temper, get on his good side. Homework/outside classwork is pretty easy. Complicates simple concepts. Do the tests HIS way, and you will get a good grade. Classes aren't too bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	2	Physics		5	4	3	4	1364418	10/17/11	Not as bad as the others made him out to be but he is a slow grader. Tests are easy if you pay attention and do the homework.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	1	Physics		3	3	3	3	1364418	9/5/11	He is not that bad at all. People on here must realize this is college, teachers don't baby you anymore. Every teacher requires calculations and such shown on every test. He is not bad.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	4	1364418	1/25/11	The worst professor I have ever had. Yells at other classes instead of shutting the door. Freaks out when a student comes to class late and tries to pick up a paper from "his Podium". Does not try to explain something a different way if you dont understand it his way then too bad. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN HELP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1364418	1/17/11	Slowest grader known to mankind, and his notes are more confusing than helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	211	3	2	2	3	1364418	10/4/10	Painfully boring. Need to show your work to how he likes it. If you took Physics before and you're used to doing work in a certain way then you have to completely throw out how you used to think and do it his way or lots of points will be taken off for not showing every minute detail.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	313	1	1	1	3	1364418	2/18/10	DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This professor is god awful -- worst prof. at RIT! Handwriting is chickenscratch. No laptops in class. Requires unit calcs on exams or major pts off. 40% failure rate. Don't take if you want higher than a C.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics		2	1	2	1	1364418	11/18/09	Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He seems like a decent guy at first, but has no concept of how to teach. Wasted time on minute algebraic details and thus had to quickly cram in the important concepts. Did not even teach all of the material... thinks it's okay to just post powerpoints online and make us teach ourselves. DROP HIS CLASS.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	313	1	2	1	2	1364418	11/22/11	He's awful. Grading is way too strict; I got points off for a side note, not even the main problem. Learned very little from lecture because he makes so many mistakes. If you take him for 313, get ready to teach yourself everything. Doesn't understand/answer questions in class. Only helpful in office hours.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	2	Physics	211	2	4	5	3	1364418	11/10/11	A great TEACHER, but he can be a rude person at times. Sometimes he complicates problems and concepts that are otherwise simple. Just come to class, do the homework, give a good effort, and work the problems on the test HIS way, and you will be fine. By the way I'm a business major taking this and getting an A. If I can do it, so can anyone else!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	2	Physics		2	5	3	4	1364418	9/13/11	The ratings here really make him look worse than he actually is. He's not that bad, professors in college aren't there to spoonfeed you. He's pretty good at explaining concepts, and emails the class every time he posts up new HW/quizzes to do. The powerpoints aren't useless. Use the lectures as a guide AND study on your own, and you're good to go.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	241	4	1	1	3	1364418	4/6/11	Terribly disorganized. Shows up to lecture late, says he will post homework problems online yet constantly misses his own deadlines to do so. Fills the board with useless diagrams and equations that are hardly readable. Never returns work, teaches silly details that the entire class already knows well. AVOID!!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics	211	2	1	3	1	1364418	1/24/11	Pretty much awful. The lectures contain useful information SOMETIMES but is often repeated problems covering not all of what he's going to test you on. The homework is on material we haven't learned, and his atrocious handwriting does NOTHING to help you figure out what rediculous reasons he uses to take off points on tests. DO NOT TAKE.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	1	1364418	11/4/10	Bad teacher, work is never handed back on time, at week nine things we're handed back from weeks 2&3, puts too much emphasis on useless calculations and barely covers the actual lecture material properly. He reads word for word from his slides which are inadequate. Barely recieved a B in the class and thats with taking a different verion elsewhere
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	2	Physics	313	1	4	3	3	1364418	2/19/10	This prof is not THAT BAD! Yeah, he doesn't want laptops or sleeping in class and he wants a lot of work like unit calc on tests, but at least this prof is decent. He explains things well, warns students about the content of exams and willingly helps people during office hours. The ratings here are making him look worse than he really is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	John Zielinski	2.1	0	Physics		1	1	1	2	1364418	1/23/10	Awful professor, blames the students for not knowing the material. 3/4 of the class was asleep while he was lecturing. Can't use a laptop or any electronic device in class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science	484	4	5	5	5	737267	2/27/12	Extremely intelligent teacher. The class requires a lot of work, but the professor is extremely helpful
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science	575	4	5	5	5	737267	4/27/09	Best java teacher in the IT department. Definitely knows his stuff, and definitely wants you to do well. Even though he uses PP, he's still funny and teaches you about real-world situations.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science		4	5	5	5	737267	2/3/07	Brilliant teacher, very helpful, funny and he knows his stuff cold. He expects you to do the work, and as long as you do it, you're fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science		5	5	5	5	737267	1/11/07	Very good teacher, very helpful. He codes on the the projector so you can follow along and see exactly what is going on.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science	484	3	5	5	5	737267	1/27/10	One of the best teachers I had at RIT. Has the work experience in his field and a lot of good examples. Very helpful, you just need to work and be interested in the material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science		2	5	4	5	737267	10/22/08	Very approachable, he was very good with me because I never had any experience with programming. show up. do your work. and ask questions. and you'll do fine
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science	360	5	5	5	5	737267	1/31/07	One of the BEST teachers are RIT. He is a great teacher, keeps your attention, grades fair, not to much work, always available and helpful.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Steve Zilora	4.9	2	Information Science		4	5	5	5	737267	10/4/06	great teacher! explains things pretty good! he doesn't use the PP slides and the book but still great teacher!
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	4	95556	3/6/10	None
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering	301	4	5	4	4	95556	3/1/09	Overall, Zion is a cool professor. He makes class very enjoyable. The only downside is that he's a bit prone to tardiness.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering	200	2	5	4	2	95556	5/1/07	I had his for Digital Fundamentals & Microcomputers. Neither class is easy but he teaches both well-- labs are difficult but homework is pretty light. Also an easygoing guy, easy to talk to.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	5	5	95556	10/13/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		4	4	5	5	95556	9/1/05	No Comments
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		3	4	4	NULL	95556	2/19/03	Helpful and caring, but not easy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering	301	5	5	5	4	95556	2/28/10	Teaches with great examples, keeps classes interesting with funny stories and examples. Labs can be tough but not too bad as long as you do your prelabs and HW. In my class he didnt have a T.A so prepare to wait. Also he may come to class 5min - 15min late so unless you want a 0% on a quiz don't skip the lab just because hes not there.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		5	5	5	5	95556	12/4/08	ive had him for 2 classes tech programming and digital fundamentals he is an excellent teacher i would suggest him to anyone
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		3	5	4	4	95556	8/11/06	Not the easiest teacher I've had but not the most difficult either. He's a good teacher who knows what he's talking about. A friendly easy-going kind of guy.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	95556	9/4/05	He's really helpful and tries to make sure that you understand the material. Willing to take time out to talk with you if you ever need it.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		4	5	4	4	95556	2/1/05	He really nice. He's very reasonable about assignments and labs. He can also be a good person to talk even if it's not about class material.
Rochester Institute of Technology	George Zion	4.6	2	Engineering		2	5	4	NULL	95556	12/10/02	Not terribly easy, but a good professor who likes to teach.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	2	Computer Science		4	4	4	3	899212	12/2/12	Good Professor, but a lot of work in the course. Grades fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	3	899212	4/9/10	Packs far too much material into his courses, and moves on before you can master it. Grading is strict but often very subjective due to lack of clear expectations. Reasonable work is always graded 80-94, and you have to go way above and beyond to even get 94. Without massive free time or overkill in background coming in, this will kill you.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	2	Computer Science		4	4	5	4	899212	1/31/10	He was clear about the course requirements, clear about what was on the test, clear about how to do things, very good about syntax and very good about how the JVM worked. Kids in the class did not understand anything he taught, which is weird because I understood him just fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	2	Computer Science	232	2	4	4	4	899212	1/26/09	Admittedly I'm not completely new to CS, but I am new to Java. I don't know what these other posters are on, but it's obviously killing brain cells. This professor only expected us to know what was covered in CS1, he encourages questions and answers them pretty well in class. The exams can be a little tough, but they're a good test of your skills
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	899212	2/20/08	Terrible professor. Teaches through powerpoints which are not clear and hard to read. Never has time to help the students outside of class, and lectures are often not well planned out. Would not recommend him to ANYONE! Can't understand WHY he still has a job.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	2	899212	4/3/07	His class was very difficult and I found him as a teacher very strict. He will not give you extra time on an exam and the exam will cover material not in class but found in the book. He is a nice guy and he knows a lot of Java but I think he is not a good teacher at all. The presentations are hard to follow, the tests are difficult, and attendance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	1	Computer Science		3	1	4	4	899212	2/7/07	Hes a smart guy and knows what hes talking about. Good at teaching, but can be a complete dick sometimes. Better than other CS teachers
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	1	Computer Science		2	3	3	4	899212	10/11/06	He does know a lot. But it was really difficult for me to follow what was going on in class because he expected a certain level of knowledge from his students and I was unfortunately just a beginner. Classes are still going on for me and I doubt if I will choose him for my next quarter.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	2	Computer Science		2	4	5	5	899212	6/23/10	This teacher is really hit-or-miss with a lot of students. Personally I loved his teaching style, which was to give you the tools you need to practice the programming and ultimately learn it yourself. He approaches CS as an art as opposed to a strict, straightforward science, which some people hate and some people love. Great professor
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	1	Computer Science	242	1	2	4	5	899212	2/10/10	Prof Zanibbi is a smart man. Unfortunately, he is probably too smart, and fails at teaching the fundamentals. Do not take him if you are a freshman, the new Computer Science sequence is difficult enough as is.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	4	899212	1/24/10	I took an intro-level course with him, but he he didn't teach it as if it were one. I had prior experience with programming so I was alright, but there were a lot of students who were completely lost because we were never taught basic syntax. Professor also seemed condescending at times, and was not very approachable.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science	232	1	1	1	4	899212	3/18/08	I sat through lectures while he talked over my head, and I figured everything out from the book. Tests seemed fair after taking them, but he would take points off if I didn't mention every little thing about java that related to the question, even if those things didn't help answer the question (expects way too much on tests). Avoid if possible.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	1	1	1	899212	2/19/08	He expects everyone to have prior knowledge of the subject and does minimal amounts of explaining things. Tells students that he's always available but gets irritated if you ask to stop by his office for help. Talks down to his students and falsely accuses them. STAY AWAY.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	0	Computer Science		1	2	2	5	899212	2/26/07	Terrible teaching techniques which got worse with the semester. Primarily studdered through important concepts making them more confusing. Gave way too much work for an intro class. He was not helpful during office hours, more concerned with not giving away answers than clarifying. Exams were graded very strictly and his review were useless.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Richard Zanibbi	2.6	1	Computer Science		2	3	2	2	899212	10/24/06	His quizzes are very difficult especially if you're just beginning CS like I am. Don't rely on the review sessions either, they don't cover what's on the quizzes. As the student above said, he assumes that you understand general Java, but for me that's not true.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		3	5	5	4	515812	1/28/13	Took 6-10 PM class, never went past 8:30 except for the first class. He make everything clear and follows the textbook more or less. Easy class to pass, all you need to do is take notes in class and use the textbook to review before each quiz (20 questions taken directly from lecture & reading)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	210	4	5	5	4	515812	12/1/11	A great professor, wish I'd taken more time to get to know him outside of class. He's a clinical psychologist so he is very knowledgeable and has a lot of real-world examples. Often lets class out early with the longer sections (mine was 4 hours, we rarely stayed all 4), and if you take good notes you'll do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	101	3	4	5	4	515812	6/7/10	I wish all liberal art classes were like his! When explaining concepts, he would give really good examples that stuck with me. Weekly quizzes were easy if you paid attention in class and read over the chapter. No midterm or final. I found it really easy to pay attention even though its was a long night class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	210	3	5	5	4	515812	10/23/09	By far my favorite class since coming to RIT! He makes all of the topics you learn relatable by telling you interesting stories and facts. 4 hour lecture flew by, often you get out early. 1 quiz per week and an easy paper. GREAT teacher, highly recommended. I wish he taught more courses than just Intro to Psych!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	1	Psychology		1	1	4	3	515812	1/27/09	He is a nice guy and can be kind of funny but he only teaches 4 hour lectures and at night. so its kinda intense. tests are EXTREMLY HARD!! hes not helpful at all. i asked to do extra credit, review with him, email. he said keep doing what your doing basically and i was FAILING!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	515812	9/29/07	There is a quiz every week covering the stuff he goe sover in class and the rest from the text; all worth 20 points that are just 20 minute multiple choices. He drops the worst quiz grade by asking you to write an essay at the end of the quarter. I would defenitely recommend his class!!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	210	4	5	5	5	515812	12/6/06	Very interesting class. Don't let the 4 hour period scare you, there is a reason he only teaches one 4 hour block. Relates concepts to real life very well, and keeps you interested the whole time. Weekly quizzes can be tricky, be sure to review a few times before taking them. One grade is dropped and replaced with an essay. Definately take him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	101	4	4	5	4	515812	7/24/06	very clear, stays on course schedule. gives a ton of helpful information that you need to pass the tests. very knowledgable about the field, very good teacher.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		4	5	5	5	515812	3/31/05	Awesome teacher! His examples are directly related and applicable! Learned so much!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		5	5	5	4	515812	11/30/04	Amazing teacher, made a four hour class seem not that long, always held my attention, really easy to get an A in his class, too.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	0	Psychology		2	1	3	2	515812	4/29/12	Extremely boring class, with long, confusing examples. Doesn't teach from the book, but material on weekly quizzes is often not covered in lectures so you have to read your notes AND the whole chapter (20-30 pages) each week. Prof is knowledgable but not very approachable. Grade is determined SOLELY on quiz scores so it is hard to get B or higher
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	210	4	5	5	4	515812	11/13/10	Dr. Ziarnowski is a clinical psychologist, so he knows the field very well and is able to give relevant examples in class. His quizzes were fair; if you took notes well and read the book, you could get at least a B. We frequently got out of class half an hour to an hour early because of his good lecturing ability. I highly recommend him.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		3	3	5	4	515812	11/24/09	It's an interesting class, but it can get trying to pay attention for the full four hours. If you aren't a good test taker, avoid, as your entire grade is based on a weekly exam of moderate difficulty. If you don't put in the study time and PAY ATTENTION, you will not do well in this class.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		4	4	5	5	515812	2/3/09	This guy is awesome. He makes class so interesting and connects what you learn in class to life. His four hour class went by faster than one of my one hour classes, and usually we got out early anyways. If you review beforehand, his weekly quizzes aren't bad. Take good notes. He bases them directly on what's said in class. I highly recommend him!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology	101	5	5	5	3	515812	11/6/08	Incredible professor. I loved every minute of his classes. 4 hours means nothing, you can feel like 20 min have gone by til the end of his lecture. Incredibly interesting, great stories relevant to material. Quizes every class, but if you take notes then you'll ace them, all multiple choice. I highly recommend this prof!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	1	Psychology		4	1	5	5	515812	9/29/07	Dont let the four hour lecture period scare you, because he makes the class so interesting that it wont bore you.There is a quiz every week covering the stuff he goe sover in class and the rest from the text; all worth 20 points that are just 20 minute multiple choices. If you pay attention in class and take notes and yeah go through the text; the
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		5	5	5	4	515812	10/23/06	Good teacher, great clarity, easy class (provided you study!). Weekly quiz, no comprehensive tests or finals. One bad score can be made up via an easy essay near week 9. Keeps you the whole class, but makes it interesting. Do read the book as some questions come from the chapter. Would recommend for anyone to take for a GPA booster or for fun. :)
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	0	Psychology		1	2	1	1	515812	10/25/05	Worse teacher ever. We had a quiz every week, no cheat sheets or study guides were allowed. NOT open book too. Quizes were material he barely went over in class. Boring four hours... you stay the whole time.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Peter Ziarnowski	4.3	2	Psychology		4	5	5	4	515812	1/31/05	excellent. no tests or midterm or final. just 20 point quizzes each week on the context of the week before. very good at making explanations and relating things to your own life so you can understand it better.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Tom Zigon	3.8	2	Not Specified		4	4	4	4	34355	4/22/08	He is a little all over the place and did not seam to have everything together but was very helpful with things that i had problems with. Was loose with the assignments and due dates

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	1	Fine Arts		4	2	3	5	512575	5/2/11	Joe Z is very technical, and you'll learn how to stay organized and to pay attention to details. His assignments aren't hard to get an A on if you follow his criteria exactly. He grades on how well you follow his directions instead of how good or interesting your pictures are.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	0	Fine Arts	201	2	2	2	2	512575	10/26/10	Inconsistent grading. Not that helpful. Puts down your ideas. Doesn't explain assignments well.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	3	512575	10/24/06	Joe is one of the most passionate professors I have met. He has high standards and will tell you every little thing that is wrong with your photos, but he is VERY helpful. He is always willing to talk about your work but you have to go to him. He grades hard but includes effort in his grading, so show him you really tried and you will do fine.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	2	1	5	512575	4/26/06	you'll learn a lot, but probably lose your mind in the process.... grading pretty inconsistent and unfair
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	4	512575	10/11/05	i dunno i'd disagree with the grading without considering effort....im not a guy and i don't suck up at all in fact i couldn't be quieter and if you hand if everything he asks and he's able to see the effort you put it, he grades pretty fairly
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	0	Fine Arts		2	1	2	1	512575	6/10/05	Granted he knows his stuff but who cares if he sucks at conveying proper information. His grading lacks any sort of rhyme or reason. If your good at ****s this is the class for you. Art is supposed to be creative and fun, and Joe Z takes every redeeming aspect of the art form and multiplies it by zero.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	1	Fine Arts		2	4	1	5	512575	11/27/04	Teaches the course backwards...
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	1	Fine Arts	106	2	3	3	2	512575	12/10/10	I actually have him as an adjunct at MCC. And he enjoys bragging about his RIT students. I agree that his grading is inconsistent. He grades this class as if we are photo majors, this is not a photo for majors class! I had to take it for my major, Graphic Design! He is helpful, knows his stuff, but doesn't teach this class properly for what it is
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	512575	5/2/07	JoeZ is the best photo teacher i've had so far. he knows what he's doing and you'll learn a LOT. the work load isn't the easiest, but he'll help you when you need it, and when you don't. he wants to help. he's a bit odd but he's a great guy. show him that you're really trying and you'll be fine. i HIGHLY recomend taking him if you get the chance.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	5	4	5	512575	7/31/06	JoeZ is one of the most passionate photo professors I have ever had. He really cares about his students in every way. Show up to class, do your work on time and you will learn SO much and succeed.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		2	4	4	4	512575	2/19/06	Joe is the best photo teacher that I have ever had. Work hard and you'll get what you want.

Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	0	Fine Arts		1	2	2	5	512575	5/17/05	He is a very hard teacher and while he does know what he is talking about he is a very unfair grader. He nevers takes into account what effort you put in just whether or not you are a guy or you suck up to him. He also just wants you to become one of his robots and show him everything so he can tell you excatly what to do-how to you learn that way?
Rochester Institute of Technology	Joe Ziolkowski	2.9	2	Fine Arts		1	4	4	5	512575	5/3/05	Joe is not an easy teacher, but he is very knowlegable. You learn a lot, but people are sometimes unsatisfied with their happiness in his class. If you aren't a slacker and want to learn a lot take his class because he has huge expectations. He does not except excuses and can be a real hard ass.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	4	3	1188373	2/27/13	Professor Z was an excellent professor. After having him for one quarter, I made sure I had him again for the next. He's very helpful, quizzes and tests relate to the material, and he is fast paced in class. You must pay attention to get a good grade. He makes it very possible to do well in the class, though!
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	0	Mathematics		1	2	2	2	1188373	1/24/13	Knows his stuff but skips steps and moves very quickly. DO NOT TAKE HIM UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO MOVE FAST. Tests and homework are difficult.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	0	Mathematics	282	1	2	2	4	1188373	11/8/12	PBII. Zlochower is brilliant, for better or worse. If you are a genius, I recommend him. If you're just smart, his style might not agree with you. He spends a lot of time correcting or proving his math rather than teaching what's important. He skips a lot of important steps, so you might lose track of the lesson. Grades projects, homework harshly.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	1	Mathematics	271	3	3	3	4	1188373	3/4/12	He does his best at everything. Sometimes he is little bit unorganized but he pulls it through. A very fair decent professor.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics		4	5	3	3	1188373	5/14/09	Dr. Z is the one of the most helpful professors I've had. His lectures are good, the notes on the board tend to be unorganized however. I would highly recommend taking a course from him, he is genuinely interested in making sure you understand the material (but be prepared to be in his office a long time when you go to his office hours, lol).
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	3	5	1188373	2/19/13	Basically the nicest professor in the world. He moves quickly in class and makes mistakes during examples, but if you pay attention, you will learn something. If you don't, homeworks are set up so you can learn from the book easily. Very hard tests, but the problems are interesting. Gives fantastic partial credit so tests and quizzes are fair.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics		3	5	4	3	1188373	11/8/12	Fast writer; you must pay attention. Makes mistakes every class & wastes 5 mins trying to correct them. Otherwise very time-efficient. New topics introduced with proof followed by many examples. Reviews HW @end of class. Will answer questions no matter how long it takes. Avg hw, extensions, bonus points. Fair grading, partial credit, weekly quizzes
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics	306	3	5	4	4	1188373	5/14/12	Good professor. Has helpful and somewhat interesting lectures. Lots of helpful office hours. Average homework load and well written tests.
Rochester Institute of Technology	Yosef Zlochower	3.7	2	Mathematics		2	5	4	5	1188373	11/25/11	Prof. Z is an excellent professor. He is really helpful, willing to help you after office hours. He def. knows what he is doing. However he sometimes will skip steps and do math in his head. If you are really interested in math and want a good challenge, you will learn a lot from him.
