University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	Mitch Abolafia	4.3	2	Sociology		1	5	4	5	462994	9/22/04	He's a hottie in his birks! But, the glare from his dome can be blinding...
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice		1	5	5	5	110112	1/27/13	Great professor who has a vast amount of knowledge. All the crj professors look up to him because of everything he has done. You aren't a real crj major unless you've had him.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	4	4	5	110112	12/13/12	Excellent Professor! One of the best Criminal Justice Professor in UALbany. You have to read and brief all the cases in the course pack, if you do this and pay attention to the little details, you"ll do fine. GO TO CLASS. It helps if you record the classes.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	0	Criminal Justice	202	1	1	1	5	110112	10/13/11	worst teacher i've had at this university. i know a lot about the material but he tested us on small facts and never gave a clear reason as to bad grades. TERRIBLE!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	425	4	5	5	5	110112	10/28/10	He teaches more than one CRJ class and they're all wonderful. He's not exactly an easy teacher but if you're in the major, definitely take some of his classes. Do the readings and ask for help when you need it and you'll do fine. He's the best in the field for a reason. If you're a CRJ major and you don't have him at least once, then you're not CRJ
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	3	5	4	110112	1/26/10	Acker is God he lives and breaths what he teaches. My previous professor was a student of his also. He is the author of the law books what more can I say the class is difficult and requires you to do the work but if you are a CRJ major it should be no problem to obtain a good grade
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	4	4	110112	3/10/09	Amazing Professor! Attendance is not mandatory per se, but its necesary to get by in the class. Tests were difficult, but if you study and know your stuff, not bad at all. Tests were not multiple choice, all short answer and/or essay. End of the year paper was not hard at all. Highly recomend taking this class.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	4/10/08	Great teacher. If you go to class you'll really understand the material. You really need to do the readings, but they're not boring. It's not a lot of work, and if you put enough effort in you'll get a good grade. He's an awsome teacher and i'll definatly take him again.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	1	3	5	3	110112	12/19/07	Acker is hilarious, I love the way he talks and all of his silly bodily movements while lecturing. The cases we studied were really interesting and I think I know a lot more about law now. Still, this class was HARD. H-A-R-D! The grading was strict with no curve. On top of that, my TA barely spoke English and was of no help at all. Ridiculous!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	3	5	5	4	110112	12/20/06	Acker is a great professor. Makes class interesting, and really seems to care about his students doing well in his class. Tests are pretty hard. WARNING: HIS TAs ARE PRETTY BAD. They grade everything and can really screw you over. Try to take an Acker class without TAs, because I think it would be a great class. Even so, 202 really isn't bad
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	5	5	110112	9/5/06	Acker is a great Professor. He is very smart and accomplished, with both his PHD and JD. He really cares about students, but if you are looking for an easy A his class probly isn't it. His classes are great/fun/interesting but challenging and a lot of work. Take him!! Especially if you are looking for a potential reccomendation
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	4	5	5	4	110112	12/19/12	My favorite professor for my first semester at the university. Extremely knowledgeable on the material, and introduces the material in a very engaging manner. If you have a question, he will thoroughly and very politely reiterate the issue until you are clear. Absolutely a wonderful professor, and extremely comical to just top it off!
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	1	4	4	5	110112	10/19/12	BEST teacher SUNY Albany has to offer in terms of CRJ. GO TO CLASS, if you don't you will struggle because the tests are not easy. if you get lost in the material ask for help and it is there.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	4	4	3	110112	4/5/11	Acker is almost to knowledgable to teach. He is a retired defense attorney and is extremely intelligent. His tests are extremely hard. You need to study and attendance is not mandatory but there will be specifics on part of the tests that you can only get from going to the class and paying attention. Don't take for an easy A. I learned a lot.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	2	5	5	110112	2/10/10	Great course. Dr. Acker is very smart and if you do your work and prepare for the exams you should do good. Know your case briefs and enjoy the world of criminal law and hypotheticals.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	5	4	3	110112	3/18/09	Dr. Acker is an amazing professor. He usually makes lectures interesting and if you do the work, the class will be relatively easy.
University at Albany (SUNY Albany)	James Acker	4.5	2	Criminal Justice	202	2	3	4	4	110112	1/26/09	Great class, but difficult - buy your course packet and read the cases!! make sure you write the briefs they help so much at test time.... the three exams are all extremely fact specific so make sure you know everything..... attend lecture and take notes.......great professor
